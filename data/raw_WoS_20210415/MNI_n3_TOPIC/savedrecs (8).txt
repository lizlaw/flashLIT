Each of four study sites contained a tract of continuous forest, one large (> 2.2 ha) forest fragment, and one small (< 1 ha) fragment, with fragments isolated for 5-20 yr preceding the study. During its respective flowering peak each tree species examined, Prosopis nigra (Mimosoideae) and Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), dominated the sites' entomophilous flora. Results indicate that flower-visitor assemblages respond to landscape features on the scale of hectares; specifically, forest fragmentation in the Chaco Serrano leads to an insect flower-visitor fauna increasingly dominated by the exotic honey bee (Apis mellifera). Bees as a group made >90% of observed flower visits to both plant species. The honey bee alone made 82% of all visits to the early-flowering tree species P. nigra and 44% to the later flowering C australe. Frequency and taxon richness of native flower-visitors at both plant species declined with decreasing forest-fragment size, but frequency of honey bee visits tended to increase in complementary fashion, such that the total frequency of insect visits to flowers of either plant species varied little with fragment size. Frequencies of visits by honey bees and those by native insects were also negatively correlated across individual trees. In both plants, visits by native insects were most consistent (varied the least among plants or over time) in large forest tracts, whereas honey bee visits to C australe were most consistent in small fragments. In pan trap samples the relative frequency of honey bees increased with decreasing fragment size. Native flower-visitors sampled by pan traps increased in numbers and taxon richness both with increasing patch size and as spring progressed. Thus, fragmentation of the Chaco Serrano appears to (a) affect native flower-visitors adversely and to (b) facilitate honey bees' access to floral resources. It is not clear that these two effects are directly related to each other, however.

Patterns of activity at a large nesting aggregation and at foraging sites are described for females of the solitary bee Anthophora plumipes (Pallas). Changes in the quality and quantity of the resource collected by females provisioning cells are related to variation in female body mass and microclimate. 2. Activity at the nest site demonstrated relationships with aspects of the thermal environment experienced by A.plumipes. Measures of temperature showing significant relationships differed for females in different stages in the nesting cycle exhibiting characteristically different behaviour patterns. 3. Larger females emerged from nest tunnels earlier in the morning and provisioned cells at lower ambient temperatures than smaller individuals. Body size therefore predicts reproductive success at low ambient temperatures. 4. Pollen and nectar loads carried by females increased with ambient temperature. Because only one cell is completed per day and the size of offspring is determined by the quality and quantity of resource provided by the mother, the body size of individuals emerging in the following season will depend on interactions between climate and body size, in addition to any heritable component. 5. Variation in activity levels at foraging sites is attributed not only to thermal considerations, but also to variation in the quality of rewards available at different floral sources.

For three species, Prosopis nigra (Mimosoideae), Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), and Atamisquea emarginata (Capparaceae), the three treatments were replicated across four sites; we achieved less replication for other species. Because comparisons between forest and fragment populations for different species took place in different sites, however, by treating all 16 species as a unit we lessened the potential bias of confounding site effects and could evaluate the overall impact of fragmentation. Significant or marginal (P < .10) fragmentation-related declines in number of pollen tubes per style, fruit set, and seed set occurred in 9 of 16, 5 of 15, and 3 of 14 species, respectively. Overall, significant or nonsignificant declines occurred in 81%(pollen tubes), 73% (fruit set), and 79% (seed set) of the species. In all cases these proportions were greater (P less than or equal to.06) than the null binomial expectation of a 1:1 ratio of increases to decreases. Breeding system did not explain sensitivity to fragmentation: the magnitudes of declines in pollen tubes, fruit set, and seed set were virtually indistinguishable between self-compatible and self-incompatible species. At least 4 of the 10 self-incompatible species, however, were heavily visited in small fragments by Africanized honey bees, which may have compensated for a decline in visits by native pollinators. The exact nature of responses varied among plant species. In some, the absolute quantity of pollen grains transferred to stigmas decreased with fragmentation, and sometimes this was reflected in reduced fruit or seed set. In Cercidium, Prosopis, and Atamisquea, the quality of the grains transferred apparently changed: number of pollen tubes produced per pollen grain on the stigma declined with increasing fragmentation, and at least in the latter two species seed production declined as well. Overall, levels of pollination and seed production undoubtedly integrated many idiosyncratic effects of fragmentation on particular plant and animal populations, and indicated that ''community health'' of fragments suffered in comparison with that of continuous forest. Median decreases in pollination levels and seed output from forest to fragments approached 20%. The impact of these declines on plant recruitment is less clear, however, because cattle grazing and trampling of seedlings and saplings in fragments may constitute a much more serious short-term conservation problem.

Morphological modifications in flowers could induce changes in attractiveness to pollinators. An apetalous turnip rape was compared to rapeseed (var Hokkaido and Samourai) and also turnip rape (var Chicon) varieties with well-developed petals. Comparisons were carried out on flowering and pollinating entomofauna. A 1.5 x 8.0-m plot size was used in a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates and 4 varieties. At full flowering and at optimal insect activity, various parameters were estimated: flower density (flower number per m2), nectar production per flower (pipetting method), sugar concentration (refractometer) and pollinator insect distribution (insect number on 0.5 x 0.8 m strips for each, plant variety and for each block). The results demonstrated that: 1) flower densities on rapeseed and turnip rape were equal; 2) nectar secretion was quantitatively and qualitatively similar in turnip rape varieties but quantitatively less when compared to rapeseed; 3) the pollinators on rapeseed and turnip rape varieties were mainly composed of Hymenoptera (in particular A mellifera) and Diptera; 4) the total number of pollinator insects was the same on rapeseed and turnip rape varieties; 5) honeybee density was significantly higher (3 to 7-fold higher; table I-1) on turnip rape than on rapeseed; 6) the distribution of other Hymenoptera (ie solitary bees and bumblebees) did not differ between rapeseed and turnip rape varieties (table I-2; 7) Diptera density was significantly higher on turnip rape than on rapeseed (2 to 7-fold higher; table I-3); 8) for the same total number of insects, the entomofauna was mainly composed of Hymenoptera (honeybees) on rapeseed and Diptera (Syrphidae) on turnip rape (table II); 9) apetalous turnip rape was as attractive to pollinators as the variety with petals; the results were the same for rapeseed varieties, between-species differences were significant. In conclusion, it was found that lack of petals in turnip rape did not seem to affect the foraging behavior of local pollinating insects.

Haifa was studied in a commercial planting at Mount Mercer, Victoria. Honeybees comprised 88% of all insect visitors to this crop. The activity of honeybees and native bees (Lasioglossum sp.) increased seed yield from 1.3 g/plot (plots closed to bees) to 40.3 g/plot (plots open to bees). The caging of plots for part of the flowering period to simulate the non-availability of bees for pollination resulted in lower seed yields than those from uncaged plots.

They bloom at the same time and are pollinated by the same species of bumblebees, mainly workers of Bombus bifarius and B. flavifrons. No natural hybrids between these Pedicularis species are known. Strong mechanical and ethological isolation occurs between the species. The stigma of the flowers is positioned differently in the two species so that it makes contact with and picks up pollen from different body parts of the bees. The flowers of the two species also differ in markings, size and shape of floral parts, and floral scent. Individual bumblebees are guided by these visual and olfactory cues during foraging and exhibit strong flower constancy to one Pedicularis species or the other, resulting in strong ethological isolation. The Pedicularis case affords one of the best examples known of strong ethological isolation in plants based on flower constancy by wild bees.

Improved agronomic practice has increased food supply over the past 50 years, but has caused a depopulation in both numbers and species of native bee pollinator within agricultural environments. This negative impact has resulted from land clearing, cultivation, irrigation, pesticides, overgrazing, and large tract of monocultures. Populations of honey bees available for crop pollination are also decreasing. As a result, we need to develop management systems for non-Apis species. The overall direction of these studies has been to provide options to seed growers or horticulturists and beekeepers in their choice of pollinator for several crops. In Europe, preservation and management of habitat has been proposed as the principal method to maintain pollinator numbers with some effort directed toward developing management systems for native bee species including bumble bees, Bombus spp., for specific crops. In North America, efforts have focused on the development of non-Apis species with significant success for the alkali bee, Nomia melanderi, various mason bees, Osmia spp., and the alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata. Three of these non-Apis species are briefly discussed in terms of biology and management system. For the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the detailed studies necessary to successfully integrate a native bee into a sustainable agricultural system are outlined.

Observations and insect collections were conducted in a peaty heath during the period 1988-1990, in the bilberry (V. myrtillus), the cowberry (V. vitis-idaea) and the bog whortleberry (V. uliginosum). Nine bumblebee species were caught on Vaccinium, 95% of these individuals were queens. They frequently visit the Vaccinium species, especially V. myrtillus. V. vitis-idaea attracted primarily honeybees but was also visited, likewise, V. uliginosum, by a diverse pollinator assemblage (with syrphids, solitary bees, bumblebees).

For animal-pollinated plants, restricting removal in favor of using all available pollinators should generally promote pollen dispersal, so that staminal characteristics should limit pollen removal by individual pollinators. Here we describe the influences of anther position on pollen removal from Pontederia cordata, a tristylous plant with anthers at three distinct positions: exserted from the flower (long-level anthers), at the mouth of the flaring tubular perianth (mid-level anthers), and near the perianth base (short-level anthers). To measure pollen removal, we presented unvisited flowers to freely foraging bees and counted the number of pollen grains left in flowers after 1-4 visits. The pollinators included two generalist bumble bees (Bombus impatiens and B. vagans: Apidae) and Melissodes apicata (Anthophoridae), a specialist with morphological and behavioral adaptations for collecting pollen from P. cordata. Analysis of pollen removal incorporated the effects of bee species, anther position, pollen size, flower length, and the number and cumulative duration of bee visits. Anther position and bee species significantly influenced pollen removal, although the differences between bee species were not related to pollinator specialization. Long-level anthers dehisced early, lost an average of 39% of their pollen during their first visit, and did not consistently contact small pollinators, such as M. apicata. Short-level anthers restricted pollen removal more (28% lost) than long-level anthers, but dehisced more slowly and were subject to unpredictable pollen removal. Mid-level anthers combine the advantages of more exserted and inserted positions without suffering the corresponding disadvantages as they restricted removal (24% lost), dehisced relatively early, and seemed to consistently contact all pollinators. The overall benefits of positioning anthers within the perianth mouth, the position occupied by mid-level anthers in P. cordata, may explain the prevalence of this morphology among bee-pollinated plants with flaring, tubular, monomorphic flowers.

J	THOENES, SC				THOENES, SC			FATAL ATTRACTION OF CERTAIN LARGE-BODIED NATIVE BEES TO HONEY-BEE COLONIES	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article								Two species of large-bodied native bees (Bombus sonorus and Xylocopa californica) were found to be attracted to honey bee colonies placed in the native bees' local environment. The bumble bees and carpenter bees were attacked en masse by the honey bees and killed. A total of 147 worker bumble bees and 5 female carpenter bees were collected in dead bee traps attached to the front of the honey bee colonies. Thus the presence of honey bee colonies can negatively impact native bee populations by weakening colonies to a vulnerable point or by eliminating potential reproductives.

Seventeen of the species were planted in four replicated plots next to a cranberry bog in Long Beach, WA, USA, and four species were already established in an area adjacent to the plots. Agastache ruposa, A. foeniculum and Lotus corniculatus were the most attractive to short-tongued bumble bees. Nepeta mussinii, Borago officinalis, Phacelia tanacetifolia and A. foeniculum were the most attractive to long-tongued bumble bees. Honey bees were most attracted to B. officinalis, P. tanacetifolia and Raphanus sativus. The major short-tongued bee species A. mellifera. B. mixtus, B. occidentalis and B. sitkensis were the only significant pollinators of cranberry. The long-tongued species B. caliginosus and B. californicus were insignificant pollinators. Bumble bees preferred purple flowers, but there was no clear relationship between bee population density and the level of available soluble carbohydrate per flower or per area. The periodicity of foraging behaviour depended on bee species and plant; honey bees peaked at 15.00 h, while bumble bees were more constant throughout the day.

Bees were collected from mid-March to mid-July during two consecutive years that were characterized by different rainfall. In the Inner Coast Ranges of Napa County, with a mediterranean climate, 73 bee species from six families were recorded on 11 shrub species; Megachilidae was the most species-rich family, followed by Andrenidae and Halictidae. Immediately inland from the coast in Marin County, where the frequently cool, foggy conditions are unfavorable for many solitary bees, the bee fauna had only half the number of species and a third the number of individuals; there were very few Megachilidae and a relatively high abundance of bumble bees. Of the 81 total species at both sites, close to one-third were shared between sites; the introduced honey bee was ubiquitous. A greater number of species were collected during the year of normal rainfall, most species were recorded in low abundance, and females comprised two-thirds of the collected specimens. Shrubs of the genus Ceanothus attracted the greatest diversity of bees. Comparison with other regional bee surveys shows the inland site here to be most typical of other areas with chaparral.

On the observed flowerings (Vaccinium corymbosum, Rubus fruticosus, R. idaeus), Apis mellifera was the most numerous species (83% of the entire number of pollinating insects active during the April to September period), followed by various species of Bombus (15%). These latter, however, play an important role in early spring and in bad weather conditions. The contribution of other pollinators (mainly solitary Apoidea and Diptera Sirphidae) is modest and insignificant, accounting for 2%. Among the Bombus, the most assiduous visitors were B. muscorum L., the most numerous, and B. lapidarius L., while B. terrestris L., B. pascuorum (Scop.) and B. pratorum L. were seen at certain circumscribed periods. A few other species, such as B. argillaceus Scop. and B. cullumanus Kirby appeared from time to time. The cumulative graphs in the note show the relative frequency of the three categories of pollinating insect (A. mellifera, Bombus spp., and others); the Tables show their percentage presence on the different plants under consideration.

The number of bees at baits was registered each 15 min. Africanized A. mellifera was the most abundant species on the baits, and foragers were most abundant at baits with higher sucrose concentration. The number of individuals of the stingless bees Plebeia (P.) spp diminished when there were 15 A. mellifera per bait, and dropped to 0 with 50 A. mellifera per bait. When replenishing with syrup was interrupted, the number of A. mellifera diminished and the number of Plebeia (P) spp raised. Foragers of other stingless bees species (Melipona asilvai Moure 1971, Frieseomelitta doederleini (Friese 1900), Partamona cupira (Smith 1863), Trigona (T.) spinipes (Fabricius 1793)) foraged at baits in lower numbers. Wasps also visited the baits, increasing in number when A. mellifera was abandoning the baits. Agonistic encounters were seen between A. mellifera foragers at baits. The small stingless bees pursued a strategy of persistent insinuation when A. mellifera was present.

J	SUGDEN, EA; PYKE, GH				SUGDEN, EA; PYKE, GH			EFFECTS OF HONEY-BEES ON COLONIES OF EXONEURA-ASIMILLIMA, AN AUSTRALIAN NATIVE BEE	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article							COMPETITION; ANTHOPHORIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; ECOLOGY; NECTAR	Honey bee hives were placed, during two consecutive summers, in an experimental site which contained natural and artificially placed colonies of Exoneura asimillima, a semi-social, native bee. Two classes of colonies were studied: founders, and established colonies. Nests and contents were collected from an experimental site and three control sites following several months of exposure at the experimental site to the apiary honey bee population. Nest contents were analysed for differences among sites in colony population parameters which could have been caused by resource competition with introduced honey bees. Colony founding and overall colony survival were also considered. During the first season, the average number of large larvae plus prepupae per colony was significantly higher in the experimental site than in the control site. This difference could, however, have been the result of a two-week gap in sampling all the sites. All nest parameters showed high variability and there were no other significant differences between the two kinds of site. In the experimental site during the second season there were, relative to the control sites, significantly fewer total numbers of adult males and females in established nests and in all nests combined, significantly more immatures of all stages in founder nests and significantly lower adult male:female ratio. Although preliminary in nature, the data suggest that, in the experimental plots, E. asimillima showed: (i) increased adult emigration, (ii) increased brood rearing success, and/or (iii) relatively later colony founding, compared to the three controls. The possibility of resource competition with honey bees causing the observed changes is discussed, along with alternative explanations.

J	CARTAR, RV				CARTAR, RV			A TEST OF RISK-SENSITIVE FORAGING IN WILD BUMBLE BEES	ECOLOGY			English	Article						BOMBUS; BUMBLE BEE; DIET CHOICE; ENERGY REQUIREMENTS; OPTIMAL FORAGING; RISK SENSITIVITY; STARVATION; STOCHASTIC FORAGING	NECTAR; COMPETITION; DECISIONS; CURRENCY; BEHAVIOR	Risk-sensitive foraging decisions (i.e., those based on both reward mean and variance) have often been observed in laboratory contexts, but there are few observations of risk-sensitive foraging in the wild. Indeed, wild foragers need not show risk sensitivity, since they can adopt alternative tactics for minimizing their probabilities of energy shortfall. I tested for risk-sensitive foraging in a natural context in coastal southwest British Columbia, Canada. Seablush (Plectritis congesta) and dwarf huckleberry (Vaccinium caespitosum) are co-occurring plants that offer foraging bumble bees equivalent expected rates of net energy intake, but that differ in variability. This equalization of mean profitabilities of floral rewards results from the actions of nectar-collecting foragers. Risk-sensitive diet choice can therefore be based solely on the variances of the foraging alternatives. I manipulated the energy requirements of bumble bee colonies (Bombus melanopygus, B. mixtus, B. sitkensis) by draining or enhancing their honey pots. I then censused foragers from these colonies on the two flower species. If bees were risk sensitive in their diet choice, they should have increased their relative use of the more variable flower type (dwarf huckleberry) when their colonies were nectar depleted compared to when their colonies were nectar enhanced. This was indeed the case. Wild-foraging bumble bees thus appear to be sensitive to both the mean and the variance of the energy rewards offered by alternative flower species, and this sensitivity is affected by colony energy requirements. These results suggest that wild foragers may change their risk sensitivity.

Bees on flowers were netted every 14 d for a year, totalling 624 h of sampling. 4086 individuals, representing 192 species and 6 families of Apoidea, visited 140 of the 184 plant species sampled in the area. A mellifera, the second most abundant bee species, was present in a small proportion of the floral sources visited by bees, some of them not primarily melittophilous. Most of the Anthophoridae, Halictidae and Megachilidae exploited plants not visited by A mellifera. Even the Meliponinae, the most similar in morphological and behavioral attributes to Apis mellifera overlapped with Apis on few plant species.

Osmia lignaria propinqua Cresson, a native bee pollinator, may improve meadowfoam pollination. A two-year survival and reproductive efficacy study was undertaken, within caged plots, to evaluate the potential of O. l. propinqua for sustaining future meadowfoam pollination populations. Pollinator density treatments of 10, 35, and 60 female bees per cage were maintained during the 1986 and 1987 meadowfoam bloom periods. Percent survival was negatively correlated with increasing female density, producing ca. a 50% average survival rate from 18 female bees. Nest, male, and total cell production increased linearly with increasing female O. l. propinqua densities. Female progeny production in 1986 and 1987 averaged 2.1, 0.6 and 0.3 females per bee from the 10, 35, and 60 female bee density treatments, respectively The male: female ratio from 10, 35, and 60 female bees per cage averaged 2.33:1, 2.63:1, and 5.62:1, respectively, indicating resources (i.e., pollen or nectar) may become limited as bee densities increase. While adult female survival and nesting success were density dependent, O. l. propinqua demonstrated the potential to survive and reproduce from resources obtained solely from foraging on Mermaid meadowfoam flowers.
