To date, evidence for a global crisis has been drawn from regional or local declines in pollinators themselves [6-9] or insufficient pollination for particular crops [9, 10]. In contrast, our analysis of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [11] data reveals that the global population of managed honey-bee hives has increased similar to 45% during the last half century and suggests that economic globalization, rather than biological factors, drives both the dynamics of the global managed honey-bee population and increasing demands for agricultural pollination services [12]. Nevertheless, available data also reveal a much more rapid (>300%) increase in the fraction of agriculture that depends on animal pollination during the last half century, which may be stressing global pollination capacity. Although the primary cause of the accelerating increase of the pollinator dependence of commercial agriculture seems to be economic and political and not biological, the rapid expansion of cultivation of many pollinator-dependent crops has the potential to trigger future pollination problems for both these crops and native species in neighboring areas. Such environmental costs merit consideration during the development of agriculture and conservation policies.																		0960-9822	1879-0445		WOS:000266891900024	19427214

Because a sizable proportion of the human diet depends directly or indirectly on animal pollination [5], the issue of how decreases in pollinator stocks could affect global crop production is of paramount importance [6-8]. Using the extensive FAO data set [9], we compared 45 year series (1961-2006) in yield, and total production and cultivated area of pollinator-dependent and nondependent crops [5]. We investigated temporal trends separately for the developed and developing world because differences in agricultural intensification, and socioeconomic and environmental conditions might affect yield and pollinators [10-13]. Since 1961, crop yield (Mt/ha) has increased consistently at average annual growth rates of similar to 1.5%. Temporal trends were similar between pollinator-dependent and nondependent crops in both the developed and developing world, thus not supporting the view that pollinator shortages are affecting crop yield at the global scale. We further report, however, that agriculture has become more pollinator dependent because of a disproportionate increase in the area cultivated with pollinator-dependent crops. If the trend toward favoring cultivation of pollinator-dependent crops continues, the need for the service provided by declining pollinators will greatly increase in the near future.																		0960-9822	1879-0445		WOS:000260551400027	18926704

Eighty-six bacterial strains belonging to 39 species of the genera Paenibacillus, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, and Virgibacillus were characterized. Amplified rDNA was digested with seven restriction endonucleases. The combined data from restriction analysis enabled us to distinguish 35 profiles. Cluster analysis revealed that P. larvae subsp. larvae and Paenibacillus larvae subsp. pulvifaciens formed a group with about 90% similarity; however, the P. larvae subsp. larvae restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern produced by endonuclease HaeIII was found to be unique and distinguishable among other closely related bacteria. This pattern was associated with DNA extracted directly from honeybee brood samples showing positive AFB clinical signs that yielded the restriction profile characteristic of P. larvae subsp. larvae, while no amplification product was obtained from healthy larvae. The method described here is particularly useful because of the short time required to carry it out and because it allows the differentiation of P. larvae subsp. larvae-infected larvae from all other species found in apiarian sources.																		0099-2240			WOS:000176631600065	12089057

Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers that anneal to dispersed repetitive bacterial sequences, we generated genomic fingerprints of a collection of 100 P. I. larvae isolates. By using BOX-primers, the strains were grouped into three clusters named A, B and C, respectively. Genotypes A and C were closely related, and all three patterns were highly similar. P. I. larvae banding patterns were distinctive from those of all other Paenibacillus, Bacillus and Brevibacillus species from apiarian sources (n = 41) examined in this work. Paenibacillus larvae subsp, pulvifaciens, the causative agent of powdery scale disease, was closely related to P. I. larvae genotype B, where the only difference found between these subspecies was a band of about 2000 bp. When using ERIC-primers, band differences between both subspecies were not detectable whereas clear differences were noticed with REP-primers. The fingerprints obtained with BOX- and REP-primers appeared unique to P. I. larvae in relation to those generated by other Paenibacillus, Bacillus and Brevibacillus species that share the same habitat.																		0021-8839			WOS:000080542900008

The isolates were characterized on the basis of DNA fingerprints by a polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR) with BOX sequence-specific primers. Isolates from Argentina generated three groups of patterns (designated A, B, and C), while P. larvae subsp. larvae strains obtained from other countries yielded two distinguishable patterns (coincident with A and B). Strains from U.S.A. and Germany were identical and related to Group A, while all Czech and English isolates belonged to Group B. Strains from France, Poland, Italy, Sweden, and New Zealand showed two different patterns (A and B). Comparisons of the biochemical type and genotype of isolates rendered no obvious linkage between both features. These results suggest that AFB in Argentina resulted from multiple sources of contaminated material. (C) 1998 Academic Press.																		0022-2011			WOS:000074565200003	9647697

The aim of this work was to develop a strategy for the subtyping and the epidemiological analysis of P larvae. Phenotypic characterisation, susceptibility to several antibiotics, electrophoresis of whole bacterial proteins, rep-PCR, ribotyping and DGGE were assessed using a collection of P. larvae isolates from different Uruguayan and Argentinean locations. Results indicated that there are two P larvae genotypes circulating in Uruguay ERIC I-BOX A (worldwide distributed) and ERIC I-BOX C (exclusively detected in Argentina until this study). These results suggest that P larvae isolates had moved between Argentina and Uruguay, probably through the Uruguay River. Patterns of whole bacterial proteins, DGGE and ribotyping did not improve the P larvae intraspecific discrimination. Antibiotic susceptibility assays showed that 100% isolates were OTC-sensitive and 22% (belonging to ERIC I-BOX A group) were sulfisoxazole-resistant. This work may contribute to the elucidation of basic aspects related to the epidemiology of AFB in Uruguay and in the region. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The causative agent is the Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. Several authors have proposed that P. larvae secretes metalloproteases that are involved in the larval degradation that occurs after infection. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the production of a metalloprotease by P. larvae during larval infection. First, the complete gene encoding a metalloprotease was identified in the P. larvae genome and its distribution was evaluated by PCR in a collection of P. larvae isolates from different geographical regions. Then, the complete gene was amplified, cloned and overexpressed, and the recombinant metalloprotease was purified and used to generate anti-metalloprotease antibodies.Metalloprotease production was evaluated by immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The gene encoding a P. larvae metalloprotease was widely distributed in isolates from different geographical origins in Uruguay and Argentina. Metalloprotease was detected inside P. larvae vegetative cells, on the surface of P. larvae spores and secreted to the external growth medium. Its production was also confirmed in vivo, during the infection of honeybee larvae.This protein was able to hydrolyse milk proteins as described for P. larvae, suggesting that could be involved in larval degradation. This work contributes to the knowledge of the pathogenicity mechanisms of a bacterium of great economic significance and is one step in the characterization of potential P. larvae virulence factors.																		1350-0872	1465-2080		WOS:000291179900022	21330433

The causative agent, Melissococcus plutonius, is a fastidious organism, and microaerophilic to anaerobic conditions and the addition of potassium phosphate to culture media are required for growth. Although M. plutonius is believed to be remarkably homologous, in addition to M. plutonius isolates with typical cultural characteristics, M. plutonius-like organisms, with characteristics seemingly different from those of typical M. plutonius, have often been isolated from diseased larvae with clinical signs of EFB in Japan. Cultural and biochemical characterization of 14 M. plutonius and 19 M. plutonius-like strain/isolates revealed that, unlike typical M. plutonius strain/isolates, M. plutonius-like isolates were not fastidious, and the addition of potassium phosphate was not required for normal growth. Moreover, only M. plutonius-like isolates, but not typical M. plutonius strain/isolates, grew anaerobically on sodium phosphate-supplemented medium and aerobically on some potassium salt-supplemented media, were positive for beta-glucosidase activity, hydrolyzed esculin, and produced acid from L-arabinose, D-cellobiose, and salicin. Despite the phenotypic differences, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrated that M. plutonius-like organisms were taxonomically identical to M. plutonius. However, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis, these typical and atypical (M. plutonius-like) isolates were separately grouped into two genetically distinct clusters. Although M. plutonius is known to lose virulence quickly when cultured artificially, experimental infection of representative isolates showed that atypical M. plutonius maintained the ability to cause EFB in honeybee larvae even after cultured in vitro in laboratory media. Because the rapid decrease of virulence in cultured M. plutonius was a major impediment to elucidation of the pathogenesis of EFB, atypical M. plutonius discovered in this study will be a breakthrough in EFB research.																		1932-6203			WOS:000303836500056	22442715

Given environmental concerns over the use of broad spectrum synthetic chemical insecticides and the evolution of resistance to these, industry placed emphasis on the development of bacteria as alternative control agents. To date, numerous commercial formulations of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) are available in many countries for control of nuisance and vector mosquitoes. Within the past few years, commercial formulations of L. sphaericus (Ls) have become available. Because Bti has been in use for more than 30 years, its properties are well know, more so than those of Ls. Thus, the purpose of this review is to summarise the most critical aspects of Ls and the various proteins that account for its insecticidal properties, especially the mosquitocidal activity of the most common isolates studied. Data are reviewed for the binary toxin, which accounts for the activity of sporulated cells, as well as for other toxins produced during vegetative growth, including sphaericolysin (active against cockroaches and caterpillars) and the different mosquitocidal Mtx and Cry toxins. Future studies of these could well lead to novel potent and environmentally compatible insecticidal products for controlling a range of insect pests and vectors of disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

By studying bee and hoverfly assemblages in Britain and the Netherlands, we found evidence of declines (pre- versus post-1980) in local bee diversity in both countries; however, divergent trends were observed in hoverflies. Depending on the assemblage and location, pollinator declines were most frequent in habitat and flower specialists, in univoltine species, and/or in nonmigrants. In conjunction with this evidence, outcrossing plant species that are reliant on the declining pollinators have themselves declined relative to other plant species. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a causal connection between local extinctions of functionally linked plant and pollinator species.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000239154300044	16857940

The process continues with a series of studies on the developmental biology, pollinating efficacy, nesting behaviour, preference for different nesting substrates, and population dynamics of the candidate pollinator. Parallel studies investigate the biology of parasites, predators and pathogens. The information gained in these studies is combined with information on the reproductive biology of the crop to design a management system. Complete management systems should provide guidelines on rearing and releasing methods, bee densities required for adequate pollination, nesting materials, and control against parasites, predators and pathogens. Management systems should also provide methods to ensure a reliable pollinator supply. Pilot tests on a commercial scale are then conducted to test and eventually refine the management system. The process culminates with the delivery of a viable system to manage and sustain the new pollinator on a commercial scale. The process is illustrated by the development of three mason bees, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski), O. lignaria Say and O. cornuta (Latreille) as orchard pollinators in Japan, the USA and Europe, respectively.																		0007-4853	1475-2670		WOS:000174496400002	12020357

The larvae were laboratory reared, thus, excluding the influence of nurse bees. The results show that larvae 24-28 h old are most susceptible to infection with P. l. larvae with a clear dose-response relationship (LD50 = 8.49). Older larvae become more and more resistant to infection with P. l. larvae so that no significant dose-mortality relationship exists in the 48-52 and 72-76 h age groups. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation exists between the development time and emergence weight for the adult bees in both the non-inoculated group and the inoculated group. There was no difference in development time between non-inoculated larvae and those that survived the inoculation.

EFB remains a threat because of a poor understanding of disease epidemiology. We used a recently published multi-locus sequence typing method to characterise 206 M. plutonius isolates recovered from outbreaks in England and Wales over the course of 2 years. We detected 15 different sequence types (STs), which were resolved by eBURST and phylogenetic analysis into three clonal complexes (CCs) 3, 12 and 13. Single and double locus variants within CC3 were the most abundant and widespread genotypes, accounting for 85% of the cases. In contrast, CCs 12 and 13 were rarer and predominantly found in geographical regions of high sampling intensity, consistent with a more recent introduction and localised spread. K-function analysis and interpoint distance tests revealed significant geographical clustering in five common STs, but pointed to different dispersal patterns between STs. We noted that CCs appeared to vary in pathogenicity and that infection caused by the more pathogenic variants is more likely to lead to honey bee colony destruction, as opposed to treatment. The importance of these findings for improving our understanding of disease aetiology and control are discussed.																		1751-7362	1751-7370		WOS:000340029800004	24599072

Sepsis and Hemocyte Loss in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera) Infected with Serratia marcescens Strain Sicaria								PLOS ONE				11	12					e0167752	10.1371/journal.pone.0167752				DEC 21 2016	2016	Global loss of honey bee colonies is threatening the human food supply. Diverse pathogens reduce honey bee hardiness needed to sustain colonies, especially in winter. We isolated a free-living Gram negative bacillus from hemolymph of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) found separated from winter clusters. In some hives, greater than 90% of the dying bees detached from the winter cluster were found to contain this bacterium in their hemolymph. Throughout the year, the same organism was rarely found in bees engaged in normal hive activities, but was detected in about half of Varroa destructor mites obtained from colonies that housed the septic bees. Flow cytometry of hemolymph from septic bees showed a significant reduction of plasmatocytes and other types of hemocytes. Interpretation of the l6S rRNA sequence of the bacterium indicated that it belongs to the Serratia genus of Gramnegative Gammaproteobacteria, which has not previously been implicated as a pathogen of adult honey bees. Complete genome sequence analysis of the bacterium supported its classification as a novel strain of Serratia marcescens, which was designated as S. marcescens strain sicaria (Ss1). When compared with other strains of S. marcescens, Ss1 demonstrated several phenotypic and genetic differences, including 65 genes not previously found in other Serratia genomes. Some of the unique genes we identified in Ss1 were related to those from bacterial insect pathogens and commensals. Recovery of this organism extends a complex pathosphere of agents which may contribute to failure of honey bee colonies.																		1932-6203			WOS:000392853100020	28002470

However, disease signs have never been encountered during hive inspections of local colonies of the Asian honey bee, Apis cerana. To study the susceptibility of A. cerana larvae to AFB, various doses of P. I larvae spores were added to larval food and disease development was monitored. Results showed that 1-day-old larvae were most susceptible, next were 2-day-old larvae, while 3-day-old larvae showed no signs of disease even when fed a large dose (4.5 x 10(4) spores/larva). The negative correlation between susceptibility and larval age was similar to that found for A. mellifera. Further, at the susceptible age, A. cerana larvae showed higher resistance than A. mellifera larvae when fed the same dose of spores. The dose of spores that would cause 95% mortality of A. mellifera larvae only led to 47.1% mortality of A. cerana larvae of the same age. This resistance by A. cerana larvae apparently was not totally related to their innate immune capability. An important aspect contributing to the resistance of A. cerana was the fact that up to 82.2% of inoculated larvae were removed by adult workers before the capped stage. This adult hygienic behaviour effectively decreased the level of spore contamination inside the hive. In contrast, results showed that A. cerana pupae were more susceptible when vegetative cells of P. I. larvae were injected into the pupal haemocoel of both species of bees.																		0021-8839			WOS:000166815300011

All species produce honey, which has been appreciated by humans since ancient times. Here, the general panorama of meliponiculture is presented. Deforestation and poor management are the main problems faced by this incipient industry. For a profitable meliponiculture, much more biological information is needed, as well as field studies in natural conditions. In the near future, we suggest that the successful use of these pollinators will promote the development of new breeding techniques and commercialization possibilities, which must be designed to be sustainable.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000238477400011

To perform genotyping of P.larvae in an epidemiological context, there is a need of a fast and cheap method with a high resolution. Here, we propose Multiple Locus Variable number of tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA). MLVA has been used for typing a collection of 209 P.larvae strains from which 23 different MLVA types could be identified. Moreover, the developed methodology not only permits the identification of the four Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC) genotypes, but allows also a discriminatory subdivision of the most dominant ERIC type I and ERIC type II genotypes. A biogeographical study has been conducted showing a significant correlation between MLVA genotype and the geographical region where it was isolated.																		1751-7915			WOS:000387000900007	27365124

In the last decades, the species disappeared from the wild in Southern Brazil, being kept exclusively in managed colonies for commercial and recreational purposes. Stingless beekeepers from this region report annual losses of their colonies due to a syndrome of yet unknown causes. We investigate whether it is associated to pathogenic microorganisms already known to cause disease in bees. These results provide a starting point for future studies aimed at clarifying the relationship between the microbial community of stingless bees and their colony collapses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

DNA profiles of all 49 geographically diverse isolates showed remarkably similar AluI profiles although four isolates (one each from Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria) displayed minor profile variations compared to AluI patterns of all other isolates. DNA from a subset of the 49 Australian and three isolates from the United Kingdom were digested separately with the restriction endonucleases CfoI, RsaI and DraI. Restriction endonuclease fragment patterns generated using these enzymes were also similar although minor variations were noted. SDS-PAGE of whole cell proteins from 13 of the 49 isolates from different stales of Australia, including the four isolates which displayed minor profile variations (AluI) produced indistinguishable patterns. Major immunoreactive proteins of approximate molecular masses of 21, 24, 28, 30, 36, 40, 44, 56, 60, 71, 79 and 95 kDa were observed in immunoblots of whole cell lysates of 22 of the 49 isolates and reacted with rabbit hyperimmune antibodies raised against M. pluton whole cells. Neither SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting was capable of distinguishing differences between geographically diverse isolates of M. pluton. Collectively these data confirm that Australian isolates of M. pluton are genetically homogeneous and that this species may be clonal. Plasmid DNA was not detected in whole cell DNA profiles of any isolate resolved using agarose gel electrophoresis. (C) 1999 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

In order to investigate the genomic potential of P. larvae, two strains belonging to two different genotypes were sequenced and used for comparative genome analysis. The complete genome sequence of P. larvae strain DSM 25430 (genotype ERIC II) consisted of 4,056,006 bp and harbored 3,928 predicted protein-encoding genes. The draft genome sequence of P. larvae strain DSM 25719 (genotype ERIC I) comprised 4,579,589 bp and contained 4,868 protein-encoding genes. Both strains harbored a 9.7 kb plasmid and encoded a large number of virulence-associated proteins such as toxins and collagenases. In addition, genes encoding large multimodular enzymes producing nonribosomally peptides or polyketides were identified. In the genome of strain DSM 25719 seven toxin associated loci were identified and analyzed. Five of them encoded putatively functional toxins. The genome of strain DSM 25430 harbored several toxin loci that showed similarity to corresponding loci in the genome of strain DSM 25719, but were non-functional due to point mutations or disruption by transposases. Although both strains cause AFB, significant differences between the genomes were observed including genome size, number and composition of transposases, insertion elements, predicted phage regions, and strain-specific island-like regions. Transposases, integrases and recombinases are important drivers for genome plasticity. A total of 390 and 273 mobile elements were found in strain DSM 25430 and strain DSM 25719, respectively. Comparative genomics of both strains revealed acquisition of virulence factors by horizontal gene transfer and provided insights into evolution and pathogenicity.																		1932-6203			WOS:000332479400144	24599066

The ability to detect and identify this organism promptly is important to allow effective sanitary measures in case of AFB. P. larvae larvae is a fastidious and slow-growing bacterium and primary isolation and presumptive identification can be difficult and time-consuming. In this study the use of PCR is described for a rapid and reliable diagnosis. The developed PCR assay is specific for P. larvae as no amplicons were produced from 13 related or hive-related species. Only with P. larvae larvae and P. larvae pulvifaciens DNA as template, an amplicon was formed. A positive reaction was also observed when DNA was extracted directly from remains of an AFB diseased larva. Thus this PCR assay provides a reliable diagnosis for AFB in only 4 hours.																		0044-8435			WOS:000170394700007

Over the last decade, tremendous progress in the understanding of P. larvae and its interactions with honey bee larvae at a molecular level has been made. In this review, we will present the recent highlights and developments in P. larvae research and discuss the impact of some of the findings in a broader context to demonstrate what we can learn from studying "exotic" pathogens.																		0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000381583400003	27394713

Biochemical and functional analyses as well as the crystal structure of Plx2A revealed that it belongs to the C3 mono-ADP-ribosylating toxin subgroup. RhoA was identified as the cellular target of Plx2A activity. The kinetic parameters (K-M, k(cat)) were established for both the transferase and glycohydrolase reactions. When expressed in yeast, Plx2A was cytotoxic for eukaryotic cells and catalytic variants confirmed that the cytotoxicity of Plx2A depends on its enzymatic activity. The crystal structure of Plx2A was solved to 1.65 angstrom and confirmed that it is a C3-like toxin, although with a new molecular twist, it has a B-domain. A molecular model of the active' enzyme conformation in complex with NAD(+) was produced by computational methods based on the recent structure of C3bot1 with RhoA. In murine macrophages, Plx2A induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization while in insect cells, vacuolization and the occurrence of bi-nucleated cells was observed. The latter is indicative of an inhibition of cytokinesis. All these cellular effects are consistent with Plx2A inhibiting the activity of RhoA by covalent modification.																		1462-2912	1462-2920		WOS:000418352800023	29124866

Four so-called enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) genotypes of P.larvae exist with P.larvae genotypes ERIC I and ERIC II being responsible for disease outbreaks all over the world. Very few molecular data on the pathogen, on pathogenesis or on virulence factors exist. We now identified two genomic loci in P.larvaeERIC I coding for two binary AB toxins, Plx1 and Plx2. In silico analyses revealed that Plx1 is the third member of an enigmatic family of AB toxins so far only comprising MTX1 of Lysinibacillus sphaericus and pierisin-like toxins expressed by several butterflies. Plx2 is also remarkable because the A-domain is highly similar to C3 exoenzymes, which normally are single domain proteins, while the B-domain is homologous to B-domains of C2-toxins. We constructed P.larvae mutants lacking expression of Plx1, Plx2 or both toxins and demonstrated that these toxins are important virulence factors for P.larvaeERIC I.																		1462-2912	1462-2920		WOS:000326108700006	23992535

American Foulbrood (AFB) caused by Paenibacillus larvae is the most devastating bacterial brood disease of the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) causing considerable economic losses to beekeepers worldwide. AFB outbreaks are mainly caused by two differentially virulent genotypes of P. larvae, P. larvae ERIC I and ERIC II. To better understand AFB pathogenesis and to complement already existing data from the genetic level we aimed at obtaining expression data from the protein level. We successfully developed a protocol for two-dimensional proteome analysis of P. larvae with subsequent mass-spectrometry based protein sequencing. Based on the obtained master protein maps of P. larvae genotypes ERIC I and II we identified the dominantly expressed cytosolic proteins of both genotypes, some of them presumably linked to pathogenesis and virulence. Comparing the master maps of both genotypes revealed differentially expressed proteins, i.e. a putative S-layer protein which is expressed by P. larvae ERIC II but absent from the proteome of P. larvae ERIC I. The implications of our findings for pathogenesis of AFB and virulence of P. larvae will be discussed.																		1758-2229			WOS:000303242200005	23757273

Recently four different genotypes of P. larvae (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus I-IV) have been described and it was shown that these genotypes also differ in phenotype, especially in virulence. To unravel the genetic differences between these four genotypes, suppression subtractive hybridization was used. From 106 analysed clones, 92 represented genotype-specific sequences, whereas 14 sequences turned out to be specific only for the particular strain used as tester in the subtraction. Nearly half of the sequences (46%) could only be annotated based on poorly characterized sequences. The remaining sequences corresponded to categories related to metabolism, especially secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism, to information storage and processing, and to cellular processes. In particular, we could show that the P. larvae genome contains genes and/or giant gene clusters coding for antibiotics, and we identified the first P. larvae toxin, a member of the family of adenosine diphosphate-ribosyltransferases.																		1758-2229			WOS:000278602600005	23765853

From AFB-dead larvae, pure cultures of P. larvae can normally be cultivated indicating that P. larvae is able to defend its niche against all other bacteria present. Recently, comparative genome analysis within the species P. larvae suggested the presence of gene clusters coding for multi-enzyme complexes, such as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The products of these enzyme complexes are known to have a wide range of biological activities including antibacterial activities. We here present our results on antibacterial activity exhibited by vegetative P. larvae and the identification and analysis of a novel antibacterially active P. larvae tripeptide (called sevadicin; Sev) produced by a NRPS encoded by a gene cluster found in the genome of P. larvae. Identification of Sev was ultimately achieved by comparing the secretome of wild-type P. larvae with knockout mutants of P. larvae lacking production of Sev. Subsequent mass spectrometric studies, enantiomer analytics and chemical synthesis revealed the sequence and configuration of the tripeptide, D-Phe-D-ALa-Trp, which was shown to have antibacterial activity. The relevance of our findings is discussed in respect to host-pathogen interactions.																		1462-2912	1462-2920		WOS:000334802400008	24975930

Previous comparative genome analysis and more recently, the elucidation of the bacterial genome, provided evidence that this bacterium harbors putative functional nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) and therefore, might produce nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) and polyketides (PKs). Such biosynthesis products have been shown to display a wide-range of biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal or cytotoxic activity. Herein we present an in silico analysis of the first NRPS/PKS hybrid of P. larvae and we show the involvement of this cluster in the production of a compound named paenilamicin (Pam). For the characterization of its in vitro and in vivo bioactivity, a knock-out mutant strain lacking the production of Pam was constructed and subsequently compared to wild-type species. This led to the identification of Pam by mass spectrometry. Purified Pam-fractions showed not only antibacterial but also antifungal and cytotoxic activities. The latter suggested a direct effect of Pam on honey bee larval death which could, however, not be corroborated in laboratory infection assays. Bee larvae infected with the non-producing Pam strain showed no decrease in larval mortality, but a delay in the onset of larval death. We propose that Pam, although not essential for larval mortality, is a virulence factor of P. larvae influencing the time course of disease. These findings are not only of significance in elucidating and understanding host-pathogen interactions but also within the context of the quest for new compounds with antibiotic activity for drug development.																		2045-8827			WOS:000343761600005	25044543

Massive brood mortality might eventually lead to collapse of the entire colony. Molecular mechanisms of host-microbe interactions in this system and of differences in virulence between P. larvae genotypes are poorly understood. Recently, it was demonstrated that the degradation of the peritrophic matrix lining the midgut epithelium is a key step in pathogenesis of P. larvae infections. Here, we present the isolation and identification of PlCBP49, a modular, chitin-degrading protein of P. larvae and demonstrate that this enzyme is crucial for the degradation of the larval peritrophic matrix during infection. PlCBP49 contains a module belonging to the auxiliary activity 10 (AA10, formerly CBM33) family of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) which are able to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides. Using chitin-affinity purified PlCBP49, we provide evidence that PlCBP49 degrades chitin via a metal ion-dependent, oxidative mechanism, as already described for members of the AA10 family. Using P. larvae mutants lacking PlCBP49 expression, we analyzed in vivo biological functions of PlCBP49. In the absence of PlCBP49 expression, peritrophic matrix degradation was markedly reduced and P. larvae virulence was nearly abolished. This indicated that PlCBP49 is a key virulence factor for the species P. larvae. The identification of the functional role of PlCBP49 in AFB pathogenesis broadens our understanding of this important family of chitin-binding and -degrading proteins, especially in those bacteria that can also act as entomopathogens.																		1553-7366	1553-7374		WOS:000340551000055	25080221

Whether such declines reduce crop yields, or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey bees, is unclear. We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower visitation by wild insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast, fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation by honey bees in only 14% of the systems surveyed. Overall, wild insects pollinated crops more effectively; an increase in wild insect visitation enhanced fruit set by twice as much as an equivalent increase in honey bee visitation. Visitation by wild insects and honey bees promoted fruit set independently, so pollination by managed honey bees supplemented, rather than substituted for, pollination by wild insects. Our results suggest that new practices for integrated management of both honey bees and diverse wild insect assemblages will enhance global crop yields.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000316731600049	23449997

Spiroplasmas and phytoplasmas: Microbes associated with plant hosts								BIOLOGICALS				38	2			193	203		10.1016/j.biologicals.2009.11.007				MAR 2010	2010	This review will focus on two distinct genera, Spiroplasma and 'Candidatus Phytoplasma,' within the class Mollicutes (which also includes the genus Mycoplasma, a concern for animal-based cell culture). As members of the Mollicutes, both are cell wall-less microbes which have a characteristic small size (1-2 mu M diameter) and small genome size (530 Kb-2220 Kb). These two genera contain microbes which have a dual host cycle in which they can replicate in their leafhopper or psyllid insect vectors as well as in the sieve tubes of their plant hosts. Major distinctions between the two genera are that most spiroplasmas are cultivable in nutrient rich media, possess a very characteristic helical morphology, and are motile, while the phytoplasmas remain recalcitrant to cultivation attempts to date and exhibit a pleiomorphic or filamentous shape. This review article will provide a historical over view of their discovery, a brief review of taxonomical characteristics, diversity, host interactions (with a focus on plant hosts), phylogeny, and current detection and elimination techniques.

Four different genetic subtypes of P. larvae were identified in Germany using the three primers. Correlating the results from genetic and morphological subtyping, the flat and transparent morphotype could be assigned to one genetic group. Geographic evaluation of our results demonstrated that the different genetic subtypes appeared in clusters correlating with different outbreaks of American foulbrood. Taken together, our results indicated that rep-PCR performed with a combination of BOX A1R- and MBO REP1- primers will be an effective tool for establishing a molecular epidemiology of P. l. larvae.																		0044-8435			WOS:000182653000001

We demonstrated that the strain-specific 50% lethal concentrations varied within an order of magnitude and that differences in amount of time for the pathogen to kill 100% of the infected hosts (LT100) correlated with genotype. One genotype killed rather quickly, with a mean LT100 of 7.8 +/- 1.7 days postinfection, while the other genotypes acted more slowly, with mean LT(100)s of 11.2 +/- 0.8 and 11.6 +/- 0.6 days postinfection.																		0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000233225000132	16269801

Our conclusions are based on the analysis of six reference strains of P. larvae subsp. pulvifaciens and three reference strains and 44 field isolates of P. larvae. subsp. larvae. The latter originated from brood or honey of clinically diseased honey bee colonies or from honey of both clinically diseased and asymptomatic colonies from Sweden, Finland and Germany. Colony and spore morphology, as well as the metabolism of mannitol and salicin, did not allow a clear identification of the two subspecies and SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins did not support the subspecies differentiation. For genomic fingerprinting, repetitive element-PCR fingerprinting using ERIC primers and PFGE of bacterial DNA were performed. The latter method is a high-resolution DNA fingerprinting method proven to be superior to most other methods for biochemical and molecular typing and has not previously been used to characterize P. larvae. ERIC-PCR identified four different genotypes, while PFGE revealed two main clusters. One cluster included most of the P. larvae subsp. larvae field isolates, as well as all P. larvae subsp. pulvifaciens reference strains. The other cluster comprised the pigmented variants of P. larvae subsp. larvae. 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined for some strains. Finally, exposure bioassays demonstrated that reference strains of P. larvae subsp. pulvifaciens were pathogenic for honey bee larvae, producing symptoms similar to reference strains of P. larvae subsp. larvae. In comparison with the type strain for P. larvae subsp. larvae, ATCC 9545(T), the P. larvae subsp. pulvifaciens strains tested were even more virulent, since they showed a shorter LTA(100). An emended description of the species is given.																		1466-5026			WOS:000236519800001	16514018

J	Giersch, Thomas; Barchia, Idris; Hornitzky, Michael								Can fatty acids and oxytetracycline protect artificially raised larvae from developing European foulbrood?								APIDOLOGIE				41	2			151	159		10.1051/apido/2009066				MAR-APR 2010	2010	A quantitative assay for the transmission of European foulbrood (EFB) in artificially raised larvae was developed. This assay was used to determine the concentration of oxytetracycline (OTC) required to prevent larvae from developing EFB and whether 8 fatty acids (undecanoic, lauric [dodecanoic], myristic, myristoleic, ricinoleic, ricinelaidic, homo-y-linolenic and 13,16,19-docosatrienoic acids) which had previously been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of Melissococcus plutonius cultures, could protect larvae from developing EFB. The larval assay involved grafting individual larva (less than 24 hours old) into a single well in a micro-titre plate. Each larva was fed 10 mu L of basic larval diet (BLD) containing 500 000 M. plutonius organisms. After 3 days the larvae were also fed 60 000 Paenibacillus alvei spores (a common secondary invader associated with EFB) in 10 mu L BLD. The combination of these two organisms was required to reliably produce symptoms typical of that seen in field cases of EFB. Most larvae infected using this protocol died from EFB. To determine the efficacy of OTC, EFB infected larvae were fed 0, 1, 2.5, 5 10 or 20 mu g/mL of OTC. Treatment with 1 mu g/mL lowered the mortality rate from 93.75% to 69.5%. Treatments with 2.5 mu g/mL to 10 mu g/mL reduced the mortality rate further whereas treatment with 20 mu g/mL reduced the rate to the same as the negative control. Larvae fed 20 or 200 mu g/mL of each of the eight fatty acids were not protected from developing EFB.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000276461200005

Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.																		1932-6203			WOS:000413168100029	29045418

We have used next-generation sequencing to identify highly polymorphic regions in an otherwise genetically homogenous organism, and used these loci to create a modified MLST scheme. This synthesis of a proven typing scheme format with next-generation sequencing combines reliability and low costs with insights only available from high-throughput sequencing technologies. Using this scheme we show that the global distribution of M.plutonius variants is not uniform. We use the scheme in epidemiological studies to trace movements of infective material around England, insights that would have been impossible to confirm without the typing scheme. We also demonstrate the persistence of local variants over time.																		1758-2229			WOS:000321759600006	23864566

There have been many reports concerning the identification, antibiotic susceptibility, pathogenicity, epidemiological investigations and typing of this organism. Accurate identification is important in defining outbreaks. The API 20E system has been used widely, but is not individually satisfactory. The growth of S. marcescens in the environment has been investigated in relation to water, disinfectants and plastics such as blood bags. Certain extracellular products are unique to S. marcescens. Pigment (prodigiosin) biosynthesis by S. marcescens has been investigated fully since the emergence of the organism as a cause of infection. Many other aspects of the pathogenicity and virulence of S. marcescens have been studied, including adherence and hydrophobicity, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and extracellular products. Two modes of adhesion to host epithelial surfaces have been suggested. These are mannose-resistant (MR) pili and mannose-sensitive (MS) pili. LPS, which is responsible for the biological activity of endotoxin, has been investigated fully and 24 somatic antigens have been described. The production of different enzymes by S. marcescens as virulence factors has also been reported, including chitinase, lipase, chloroperoxidase and an extracellular protein, HasA. Antibiotics used to treat serratia infection include beta-lactam agents, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones and a variety of different resistance mechanisms have been demonstrated. Typing methods used to study the epidemiology of S. marcescens include biotyping, bacteriocin typing, phage typing, plasmid analysis, polymerase chain reaction amplification of enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences (ERIC-PCR) and ribotyping. Serological typing has also been used and this method seems to be a suitable first-line typing method for S. marcescens, although some strains remain untypable. RAPD-PCR has also been applied to a small number of isolates and seems to be a promising method, especially for rapid monitoring of an outbreak and tracing the source of initial infection.																		0022-2615	1473-5644		WOS:A1997YE22900002	9368530

AFB is a notifiable epizootic in most countries and, hence, P. larvae is of considerable relevance for veterinarians and apiculturists alike. Over the last decade, much progress has been made in the understanding of the (patho)biology of P. larvae. Recently, several non-ribosomally produced peptides (NRP) and peptide/polyketide (NRP/PK) hybrids produced by P. larvae were identified. Among these NRPs were iturin-like lipopeptides, the paenilarvins A-C. Iturins are known to exhibit strong anti-fungal activity; for some iturins, cytotoxic activity towards mammalian erythrocytes and human cancer cell lines are described. We here present our results on the analysis of the natural function of the paenilarvins during pathogenesis of P. larvae infections. We demonstrated production of paenilarvins in infected larvae. However, we could neither demonstrate cytotoxicity of paenilarvins towards cultured insect cells nor towards larvae in feeding assays. Accordingly, exposure bioassays performed with larvae infected by wild-type P. larvae and a knockout mutant of P. larvae lacking production of paenilarvins did not substantiate a role for the paenilarvins as virulence factor. Further experiments are necessary to analyze the relevance of the paenilarvins' anti-fungal activity for P. larvae infections in the presence of fungal competitors in the larval midgut or cadaver.																		1932-6203			WOS:000386204000042	27760211

This bacterial infection of honey bee brood is a notifiable epizootic posing a serious threat to global honey bee health because not only individual larvae but also entire colonies succumb to the disease. In the recent past considerable progress has been made in elucidating molecular aspects of host pathogen interactions during pathogenesis of P. larvae infections. Especially the sequencing and annotation of the complete genome of P. larvae was a major step forward and revealed the existence of several giant gene clusters coding for non-ribosomal peptide synthetases which might act as putative virulence factors. We here present the detailed analysis of one of these clusters which we demonstrated to be responsible for the biosynthesis of bacillibactin, a P. larvae siderophore. We first established culture conditions allowing the growth of P. larvae under iron-limited conditions and triggering siderophore production by P. larvae. Using a gene disruption strategy we linked siderophore production to the expression of an uninterrupted bacillibactin gene cluster. In silico analysis predicted the structure of a trimeric trithreonyl lactone (DHB-Gly-Thr)(3) similar to the structure of bacillibactin produced by several Bacillus species. Mass spectrometric analysis unambiguously confirmed that the siderophore produced by P. larvae is identical to bacillibactin. Exposure bioassays demonstrated that P. larvae bacillibactin is not required for full virulence of P. larvae in laboratory exposure bioassays. This observation is consistent with results obtained for bacillibactin in other pathogenic bacteria.																		1932-6203			WOS:000342491600092	25237888

Although most inoculated larvae were removed by adult nurse bees, particularly the 1st and 2nd day after inoculation, the percentage removed before the brood was sealed increased with increasing spore dosage and decreased with increasing larval age at inoculation. More than half the reared larvae removed by hand 1 or 2 days after inoculation contained motile bacterial rods; the check larvae (uninoculated) contained no rods. Both types of inoculum used (spores or vegetative cells) caused the same mortality in 1-2 day old larvae and the nurse bees quickly removed larvae infected with either inoculum before sealing. Only the spore stage appeared infective to older larvae. B. pulvifaciens is highly pathogenic to young honey bee larvae, but kills them so rapidly that nearly all are removed from the brood cells by the nurse bees before cells are capped. Few remain to reach the powdery scale stage. Early detection and removal of diseased larvae may prevent the perpetuation and spread of the pathogen within and between bee colonies because the infected larvae are removed before the bacterium develops spores.																		0022-8567			BCI:BCI197968033747

C3larvin targets RhoA as a substrate for its transferase reaction, and kinetics for both the NAD(+) (K-m = 34 +/- 12 mu M) and RhoA (K-m = 17 +/- 3 mu M) substrates were characterized for this enzyme from the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 toxin subgroup. C3larvin is toxic to yeast when expressed in the cytoplasm, and catalytic variants of the enzyme lost the ability to kill the yeast host, indicating that the toxin exerts its lethality through its enzyme activity. A small molecule inhibitor of C3larvin enzymatic activity was discovered called M3 (K-i = 11 +/- 2 mu M), and to our knowledge, is the first inhibitor of transferase activity of the C3 toxin family. C3larvin was crystallized, and its crystal structure (apoenzyme) was solved to 2.3 angstrom resolution. C3larvin was also shown to have a different mechanism of cell entry from other C3 toxins.																		0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000348056400031	25477523

We used cryo-electron tomography to study the three-dimensional structure of Spiroplasma melliferum cells in a close-to-native state at similar to4-nanometer resolution. We showed that these cells possess two types of filaments arranged in three parallel ribbons underneath the cell membrane. These two filamentous structures are built of the fibril protein and possibly the actin-like protein MreB. On the basis of our structural data, we could model the motility modes of these cells and explain how helical Mollicutes can propel themselves by means of coordinated length changes of their cytoskeletal ribbons.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000226492300051	15662018

Bacillus thuringiensis serovariety israelensis and Bacillus sphaericus for mosquito control								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION				23	2			133	163		10.2987/8756-971X(2007)23[133:BTSIAB]2.0.CO;2			S	2007	2007	Since the discovery of Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) serovariety israelensis de Barjac, (Bti) and efficacious isolates of Bacillus sphaericus Neide, formulations of these bacteria have become the predominant non-chemical means employed for control of mosquito larvae at several locations in the United States and other countries. An overview of developments in the past 20 years is presented in this chapter regarding the toxins of Bti and B. sphaericus, their modes of action, efficacy and factors that affect larvicidal activity, development of resistance, safety, and their roles in integrated mosquito control. The efficacy of Bti formulations has been demonstrated in a variety of habitats against a multitude of species of mosquitoes. B. sphaericus formulations have been utilized predominantly in organically enriched habitats against Culex species, but they are also active in a variety of habitats having low organic enrichment, against numerous species, and across several genera. Stegomyia spp. are not susceptible to practical doses of B. sphaericus formulations. B. sphaericus has been shown to persist longer than Bti in polluted habitats and, under certain circumstances, can recycle in larval cadavers. A disadvantage of B. sphaericus has been the development of resistance in certain populations of Cx. quinquefasciatus Say and Cx. pipiens Linnaeus. Biotic and abiotic factors that influence the larvicidal activity of Bti and B. sphaericus include species of mosquito and their respective feeding strategies, rate of ingestion, age and density of larvae, habitat factors (temperature, solar radiation, depth of water, turbidity, tannin and organic content, presence of vegetation, etc.), formulation factors (type of formulation, toxin content, how effectively the material reaches the target, and settling rate), storage conditions, production factors, means of application and frequency of treatments. Due to their efficacy and relative specificity, both Bti and B. sphaericus can be ideal control agents in integrated programs especially where other biological control agents, environmental management, personal protection and the judicious use of insecticides are combined.																		8756-971X	1943-6270		WOS:000248916900012	17853604

Serratia Infections: from Military Experiments to Current Practice								CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS				24	4			755	+		10.1128/CMR.00017-11				OCT 2011	2011	Serratia species, in particular Serratia marcescens, are significant human pathogens. S. marcescens has a long and interesting taxonomic, medical experimentation, military experimentation, and human clinical infection history. The organisms in this genus, particularly S. marcescens, were long thought to be nonpathogenic. Because S. marcescens was thought to be a nonpathogen and is usually red pigmented, the U.S. military conducted experiments that attempted to ascertain the spread of this organism released over large areas. In the process, members of both the public and the military were exposed to S. marcescens, and this was uncovered by the press in the 1970s, leading to U.S. congressional hearings. S. marcescens was found to be a certain human pathogen by the mid-1960s. S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens have been isolated as causative agents of numerous outbreaks and opportunistic infections, and the association of these organisms with point sources such as medical devices and various solutions given to hospitalized patients is striking. Serratia species appear to be common environmental organisms, and this helps to explain the large number of nosocomial infections due to these bacteria. Since many nosocomial infections are caused by multiply antibiotic-resistant strains of S. marcescens, this increases the danger to hospitalized patients, and hospital personnel should be vigilant in preventing nosocomial outbreaks due to this organism. S. marcescens, and probably other species in the genus, carries several antibiotic resistance determinants and is also capable of acquiring resistance genes. S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens are usually identified well in the clinical laboratory, but the other species are rare enough that laboratory technologists may not recognize them. 16S rRNA gene sequencing may enable better identification of some of the less common Serratia species.																		0893-8512	1098-6618		WOS:000295837000007	21976608

EFB did not develop in larvae fed 1.1 x 10(9) artificially cultured M. plutonius organisms/ml. However, the use of M. plutonius extracted from diseased material effectively transmitted EFB to larvae at a minimum concentration of 200 M. plutonius organisms/ml. The method used to raise and infect larvae in vitro had an associated larval survival of 81.2-100% (mean 91.9%). A strong correlation (r(2) = 0.96) was established between the mortality of larvae that died from EFB and the dose of M. plutonius organisms. A clear linear relationship exists between the time duration of feeding M. plutonius inoculated basic larval diet (2 x 10(5) organisms/ml) and larval mortality (r(2) = 0.92).																		0021-8839	2078-6913		WOS:000225434000003

Whereas these losses pose a threat to apiculture, the number of globally managed colonies appeared to be less affected because beekeepers replace lost colonies. From a socioeconomic and ecological perspective the number of managed colonies is arguably more relevant when addressing the issue of apiculture and pollination services provided by honeybees. We here use the FAO data base to dissect the interactions between the global honey market and the number of colonies. Global scale analyses do not show a general colony decline. Whereas Western Europe and the US show suffer colony declines, other regions show considerable increase. We could not find any link between the colony dynamics and the occurrence of specific pathogens or the use of pesticides. In contrast, changes in the political and socioeconomic system show strong effects on apiculture. In addition, many countries show a tight negative correlation between honey import and the number of managed colonies. For some countries, the amount of honey produced per colony is highly positively correlated with the amount of honey imports, and we cannot exclude large scale relabeling of imported to nationally produced honey. It is very clear that honey trade is a dominating factor for the number of managed colonies since countries with a strong import and export ratio are those suffering most strongly from colony declines.

The absence of a repeatable, universal typing scheme for the causative bacterium Paenibacillus larvae has restricted our understanding of disease epidemiology. We have created the first multilocus sequence typing scheme (MLST) for P.larvae, which largely confirms the previous enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based typing scheme's divisions while providing added resolution and improved repeatability. We have used the new scheme to determine the distribution and biogeography of 294 samples of P.larvae from across six continents. We found that of the two most epidemiologically important ERIC types, ERIC I was more diverse than ERIC II. Analysis of the fixation index (F-ST) by distance suggested a significant relationship between genetic and geographic distance, suggesting that population structure exists in populations of P.larvae. Interestingly, this effect was only observed within the native range of the host and was absent in areas where international trade has moved honeybees and their disease. Correspondence analysis demonstrated similar sequence type (ST) distributions between native and non-native countries and that ERIC I and II STs mainly have differing distributions. The new typing scheme facilitates epidemiological study of this costly disease of a key pollinator.																		1462-2912	1462-2920		WOS:000352545100037	25244044

AFB is one of the most destructive honey bee diseases since it is not only lethal for infected larvae but also for the diseased colonies. Due to the high impact of honey bees on ecology and economy this epizootic is a severe and pressing problem. Knowledge about virulence mechanisms and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. Recent genome sequencing of P. larvae revealed its potential to produce unknown secondary metabolites, like nonribosomal peptides and peptide-polyketide hybrids. This article highlights recent findings on secondary metabolites synthesized by P. larvae and discusses their role in virulence and pathogenicity towards the bee larvae.																		0265-0568	1460-4752		WOS:000355489000001	25904391

M. plutonius strains can be grouped into three genetically distinct groups (CC3, CC12 and CC13). Because EFB could not be reproduced in artificially reared honeybee larvae by fastidious strains of CC3 and CC13 previously, we investigated a method to improve experimental conditions using a CC3 strain and found that infection with a potassium-rich diet enhanced proliferation of the fastidious strain in larvae at the early stage of infection, leading to the appearance of clear clinical symptoms. Further comparison of M. plutonius virulence under the conditions revealed that the representative strain of CC12 was extremely virulent and killed all tested bees before pupation, whereas the CC3 strain was less virulent than the CC12 strain, and a part of the infected larvae pupated. In contrast, the tested CC13 strain was avirulent, and as with the non-infected control group, most of the infected brood became adult bees, suggesting differences in the insect-level virulence among M. plutonius strains with different genetic backgrounds. These strains and the improved experimental infection method to evaluate their virulence will be useful tools for further elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms of EFB.																		2045-2322			WOS:000383493400001	27625313

Nest management of this Eurasian nonsocial pollinator transformed the alfalfa seed industry in North America, tripling seed production. The most common ALCB management practice is the loose cell system, in which cocooned bees are removed from nesting cavities for cleaning and storage. Traits of ALCBs that favored their commercialization include gregarious nesting; use of leaves for lining nests; ready acceptance of affordable, mass-produced nesting materials; alfalfa pollination efficacy; and emergence synchrony with alfalfa bloom. The ALCB became a commercial success because much of its natural history was understood, targeted research was pursued, and producer ingenuity was encouraged. The ALCB presents a model system for commercializing other solitary bees and for advancing new testable hypotheses in diverse biological disciplines.																		0066-4170	1545-4487	978-0-8243-0156-9	WOS:000286841900012	20809804

We here report on several peptides and proteins that have recently been identified, biochemically analyzed, and proposed to act as virulence factors of P. larvae.

AFB outbreaks are predominantly caused by two genotypes of P. larvae, ERIC I and ERIC II, with P. larvae ERIC II being the more virulent genotype on larval level. Recently, comparative proteome analyses have revealed that P. larvae ERIC II but not ERIC I might harbour a functional S-layer protein, named SplA. We here determine the genomic sequence of splA in both genotypes and demonstrate by in vitro self-assembly studies of recombinant and purified SplA protein in combination with electron-microscopy that SplA is a true S-layer protein self-assembling into a square 2D lattice. The existence of a functional S-layer protein is novel for this bacterial species. For elucidating the biological function of P. larvae SplA, a genetic system for disruption of gene expression in this important honey bee pathogen was developed. Subsequent analyses of in vivo biological functions of SplA were based on comparing a wild-type strain of P. larvae ERIC II with the newly constructed splA-knockout mutant of this strain. Differences in cell and colony morphology suggest that SplA is a shape-determining factor. Marked differences between P. larvae ERIC II wild-type and mutant cells with regard to (i) adhesion to primary pupal midgut cells and (ii) larval mortality as measured in exposure bioassays corroborate the assumption that the S-layer of P. larvae ERIC II is an important virulence factor. Since SplA is the first functionally proven virulence factor for this species, our data extend the knowledge of the molecular differences between these two genotypes of P. larvae and contribute to explaining the observed differences in virulence. These results present an immense advancement in our understanding of P. larvae pathogenesis.																		1553-7366	1553-7374		WOS:000305322900049	22615573

Here, we report on a comprehensive bee pathogen screening in Belgium covering 363 bee colonies that were screened for 18 known disease-causing pathogens and correlate their incidence in summer with subsequent winter mortality. Our analyses demonstrate that, in addition to Varroa destructor, the presence of the trypanosomatid parasite Crithidia mellificae and the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae in summer are also predictive markers of winter mortality, with a negative synergy being observed between the two in terms of their effects on colony mortality. Furthermore, we document the first occurrence of a parasitizing phorid fly in Europe, identify a new fourth strain of Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), and confirm the presence of other little reported pathogens such as Apicystis bombi, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Spiroplasma apis, Spiroplasma melliferum and Varroa destructor Macula-like Virus (VdMLV). Finally, we provide evidence that ALPV and VdMLV replicate in honey bees and show that viruses of the LSV complex and Black Queen Cell Virus tend to non-randomly co-occur together. We also noticed a significant correlation between the number of pathogen species and colony losses. Overall, our results contribute significantly to our understanding of honey bee diseases and the likely causes of their current decline in Europe.																		1932-6203			WOS:000324228800073	23991113	
J	Reinert, DJ; Carpusca, I; Aktories, K; Schulz, GE								Structure of the mosquitocidal toxin from Bacillus sphaericus								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				357	4			1226	1236		10.1016/j.jmb.2006.01.025				APR 7 2006	2006	The catalytic domain of a mosquitocidal toxin prolonged by a C-terminal 44 residue linker connecting to four ricin B-like domains was crystallized. Three crystal structures were established at resolutions between 2.5 angstrom and 3.0 angstrom using multi-wavelength and single-wavelength anomalous X-ray diffraction as well as molecular replacement phasing techniques. The chainfold of the toxin fragment corresponds to those of ADP-ribosylating enzymes. At pH 4.3 the fragment is associated in a C-7-symmetric heptamer in agreement with an aggregate of similar size observed by size-exclusion chromatography. In two distinct crystal forms, the heptamers formed nearly spherical, D-7-symmetric tetradecamers. Another crystal form obtained at pH 6.3 contained a recurring C-2-symmetric tetramer, which, however, was not stable in solution. On the basis of the common chainfold and NAD(+)-binding site of all ADP-ribosyl transferases, the NAD(+)-binding site of the toxin was assigned at a high confidence level. In all three crystal forms the NAD(+) site was occupied by part of the 44 residue linker, explaining the known inhibitory effect of this polypeptide region. The structure showed that the cleavage site for toxin activation is in a highly mobile loop that is exposed in the monomer. Since it contains the inhibitory linker as a crucial part of the association contact, the observed heptamer is inactive. Moreover, the heptamer cannot be activated by proteolysis because the activation loop is at the ring center and not accessible for proteases. Therefore the heptamer, or possibly the tetradecamer, seems to represent an inactive storage form of the toxin. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Of the four known ERIC-genotypes of P. larvae, ERIC I and II are most frequently observed and differ significantly in virulence. The course of the disease on the larval level is more accelerated after infection with genotype II strains allowing nurse bees to remove diseased larvae more efficiently before capping. For this reason the lead clinical symptom, conversion of capped larvae into 'ropy mass', is less frequently found than after infection with ERIC I strains bearing the risk of false negative diagnosis. In this study, the potential of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the discrimination of P. larvae genotypes ERIC I and II was explored on the basis of a comprehensive set of isolates. Using commercial software and a reference database constructed from field and type strains, ERIC I and II genotypes of all field isolates could be unambiguously identified on basis of mass spectra. Statistical analysis showed that the genotype is the main determinant for the spectral phenotype and MS-based ERIC-type determination is robust against sample selection. Furthermore, analysis of samples from Canada and New Zealand showed that distribution of ERIC II is not restricted to Europe as previously assumed. We suggest adding ERIC I and II genotype isolates as type-specific reference spectra for use in routine diagnostics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we provide a comprehensive survey for the prevalence of these two Spiroplasma species in current populations of honey bees using improved molecular diagnostic techniques to assay multiyear colony samples from North America (U.S.A.) and South America (Brazil). Significant annual and seasonal fluctuations of Spiroplasma apis and Spiroplasma melliferum prevalence in colonies from the U.S.A. (n = 616) and Brazil (n = 139) occurred during surveys from 2011 through 2013. Overall, 33% of U.S.A. colonies and 54% of Brazil colonies were infected by Spiroplasma spp., where S. melliferum predominated over S. apis in both countries (25% vs. 14% and 44% vs. 38% frequency, respectively). Colonies were co-infected by both species more frequently than expected in both countries and at a much higher rate in Brazil (52%) compared to the U.S.A. (16.5%). U.S.A. samples showed that both species were prevalent not only during spring, as expected from prior research, but also during other seasons. These findings demonstrate that the model of honey bee spiroplasmas as springtime-restricted pathogens needs to be broadened and their role as occasional pathogens considered in current contexts.																		2045-8827			WOS:000342354500007	24771723

In particular, a number of mason bees (Megachilidae; Osmia) are among the most widely used alternative pollinators, and their utilisation has been fine-tuned specifically for pollination in fruit tree orchards. A successful management system should not only aim at optimising pollination efficiency but also consider the relevant biological and ecological requirements to achieve sustainable and healthy bee populations. Here, we review the factors influencing the rate of population increase during the implementation of Osmia bees as orchard pollinators. These factors include nesting material, release methods, and control of antagonists as well as methods optimising management of developmental stages to synchronize bee activity with orchard bloom and to minimize developmental mortality.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000328846600008

We isolated a disease-causing bacterium, Lysinibacillus sphaericus (Firmicutes, Bacillaceae), from worker and queen larvae, brood cell provisions and honey stores. Pathogenicity experiments confirmed this bacterium as the causal organism. It took 22 days from infection to first appearance of brood disease symptoms.

Although the amounts of honey are generally smaller than in the nests of honey bees, people have used stingless bee honey for many centuries. Comparatively little attention has been given to these bees in beekeeping development programmes. It is now realized that stingless bees are important resources for the production of a special type of honey and other products. A limiting factor in the production of stingless bee honey is the way in which domesticated colonies are housed. Because of the specific biology and the fundamentally different nest architecture, the technology developed for apiculture with A, mellifera and A, cerana does not apply to stingless beekeeping.																		0005-772X			WOS:000081698500004

In the present work, we screened crude extracts derived from fermentations of P. larvae genotypes ERIC I and II for antimicrobial activity, following the detection of four putative secondary metabolite gene clusters that show high sequence homology to known biosynthetic gene clusters for the biosynthesis of antibiotics. Low molecular weight metabolites produced by P. larvae have recently been shown to have toxic effects on honey bee larvae. Moreover, a novel tripeptide, sevadicin, was recently characterized from laboratory cultures of P. larvae. In this study, paenilarvins, which are iturinic lipopeptides exhibiting strong antifungal activities, were obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation from cultures of P. larvae, genotype ERIC II. Their molecular structures were determined by extensive 2D NMR spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry, and other methods. Paenilarvins are the first antifungal secondary metabolites to be identified from P. larvae. In preliminary experiments, these lipopeptides also affected honey bee larvae and might thus play a role in P. larvae survival and pathogenesis. However, further studies are needed to investigate their function.																		1439-4227	1439-7633		WOS:000341586100015	25069424

Two toxic subclones, designated pXP33 and pXP34, obtained by ligating PstI-derived fragments of pKF2 into pUC18, contained the same 3.8-kb fragment, but in opposite orientations. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame corresponding to a 100-kDa protein and the 3' end of a further open reading frame having significant homology to open reading frames of transposons Tn501 and Tn21. The sequence of the SSII-1 toxin was compared with those of known toxins and was found to show regional homology to those of ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins.

Structure and mode of action of a mosquitocidal holotoxin								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				381	1			150	159		10.1016/j.jmb.2008.05.067				AUG 1 2008	2008	The crystal structure of the full mosquitocidal toxin from Bacillus sphaericus (MTXholo) has been determined at 2.5 angstrom resolution by the molecular replacement method. The resulting structure revealed essentially the complete chain consisting of four ricin B-type domains curling around the catalytic domain in a hedgehog-like assembly. As the structure was virtually identical in three different crystal packings, it is probably not affected by packing contacts. The structure of MTXholo explains earlier autoinhibition data. An analysis of published complexes comprising ricin B-type lectin domains and sugar molecules shows that the general construction principle applies to all four lectin domains of MTXholo, indicating 12 putative sugar-binding sites. These sites are sequence-related to those of the cytotoxin pierisin from cabbage butterfly, which are known to bind glycolipids. It seems therefore likely that MTXholo also binds glycolipids. The seven contact interfaces between the five domains are predominantly polar and not stronger than common crystal contacts so that in an appropriate environment, the multidomain structure would likely uncurl into a string of single domains. The structure of the isolated catalytic domain plus an extended linker was established earlier in three crystal packings, two of which showed a peculiar association around a 7-fold axis. The catalytic domain of the reported MTXholo closely resembles all three published structures, except one with an appreciable deviation of the 40 N-terminal residues. A comparison of all structures suggests a possible scenario for the translocation of the toxin into the cytosol. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that efficient chitin degradation additionally depends on the action of a small noncatalytic protein, CBP21, which binds to the insoluble crystalline substrate, leading to structural changes in the substrate and increased substrate accessibility. CBP21 strongly promoted hydrolysis of crystalline beta-chitin by chitinases A and C, while it was essential for full degradation by chitinase B. CBP21 variants with single mutations on the largely polar binding surface lost their ability to promote chitin degradation, while retaining considerable affinity for the polymer. Thus, binding alone is not sufficient for CBP21 functionality, which seems to depend on specific, mostly polar interactions between the protein and crystalline chitin. This is the first time a secreted binding protein is shown to assist in the enzymatic degradation of an insoluble carbohydrate via non-hydrolytic disruption of the substrate. Interestingly, homologues of CBP21 occur in most chitin-degrading microorganisms, suggesting a general mechanism by which chitin-binding proteins enhance chitinolytic activity. Homologues also occur in chitinase-containing insect viruses, whose infectiousness is known to depend on chitinase efficiency.																			1083-351X		WOS:000230857300039	15929981

This machinery includes four chitin-active enzymes: ChiC, an endo-acting non-processive chitinase; ChiA and ChiB, two processive chitinases moving along chitin chains in opposite directions; and CBP21, a surface-active CBM33-type lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase that introduces chain breaks by oxidative cleavage. Furthermore, an N-acetylhexosaminidase or chitobiase converts the oligomeric products from the other enzymes to monomeric N-acetylglucosamine. Here we discuss the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes as well as the structural basis of each enzyme's specific role in the chitin degradation process. We also discuss how knowledge of this enzyme system may be extrapolated to other enzyme systems for conversion of insoluble polysaccharides, in particular conversion of cellulose by cellulases and GH61-type lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases.																		1742-464X	1742-4658		WOS:000320557100007	23398882

This enzymatic activity was discovered and further characterized by using mass spectrometry and chromatographic separation methods to detect oxidized products generated in the absence or presence of H(2)(18)O or (18)O(2). There are strong indications that similar enzymes exist that work on cellulose. Our findings not only demonstrate the existence of a hitherto unknown enzyme activity but also provide new avenues toward more efficient enzymatic conversion of biomass.																		0036-8075			WOS:000282644600041	20929773

They are prized for their honey and wax production and depended upon for pollination of many important crops. While globally honey bee populations have been increasing, the rate of increase is not keeping pace with demand. Further, honey bee populations have not been increasing in all parts of the world, and have declined in many nations in Europe and in North America. Managed honey bee populations are influenced by many factors including diseases, parasites, pesticides, the environment, and socio-economic factors. These factors can act alone or in combination with each other.

Five species of bumblebees are currently used for crop pollination, the major ones being Bombus terrestris from Eurasia and Bombus impatiens from North America. As a result of their frequent use in foreign territories, there have been reports of B. terrestris becoming established, as well as interactions and/or competition with local (bumble-) bee fauna. Of the many vegetable, fruit and seed crops that bumblebees pollinate, greenhouse tomatoes are of predominant importance. In 2004, 40 000 ha of tomato crops were pollinated, with a crop value of e 12 000 million. The growers benefit from bumblebee pollination because of lower production costs, increased yields, and improved fruit quality. The interrelationship between commercial mechanisms and ecological risks is discussed.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000238973900002

Batsch is self-compatible and largely self-fertile, but under greenhouse conditions pollinators must be introduced to achieve good fruit set and quality. Because little work has been done to assess the effectiveness of different pollinators on peach trees under greenhouse conditions, we studied 'Okubo' peach in greenhouse tunnels near Beijing between 2012 and 2014. We measured pollen deposition, pollen-tube growth rates, ovary development, and initial fruit set after the flowers were visited by either of two managed pollinators: bumblebees, Bombus patagiatus Nylander, and honeybees, Apis mellifera L. The results show that B. patagiatus is more effective than A. mellifera as a pollinator of peach in greenhouses because of differences in two processes. First, B. patagiatus deposits more pollen grains on peach stigmas than A. mellifera, both during a single visit and during a whole day of open pollination. Second, there are differences in the fertilization performance of the pollen deposited. Half of the flowers visited by B. patagiatus are fertilized 9-11 days after bee visits, while for flowers visited by A. mellifera, half are fertilized 13-15 days after bee visits. Consequently, fruit development is also accelerated by bumblebees, showing that the different pollinators have not only different pollination efficiency, but also influence the subsequent time course of fertilization and fruit set. Flowers visited by B. patagiatus show faster ovary growth and ultimately these flowers produce more fruit. Our work shows that pollinators may influence fruit production beyond the amount of pollen delivered. We show that managed indigenous bumblebees significantly outperform introduced honeybees in increasing peach initial fruit set under greenhouse conditions.																		1932-6203			WOS:000351987300217	25799170	
J	Zheng, Huo-Qing; Chen, Yan Ping								Detection of Spiroplasma melliferum in honey bee colonies in the US								JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY				119				47	49		10.1016/j.jip.2014.03.006				JUN 2014	2014	Spiroplasma infections in honey bees have been reported in Europe and Asia quite recently, due to intensive studies on the epidemiology of honey bee diseases. The situation in the US is less well analyzed. Here, we examined the honey bee colonies in Beltsville, MD, where Spiro plasma melliferum was originally reported and found S. melliferum infection in honey bees. Our data showed high variation of S. melliferum infection in honey bees with a peak prevalence in May during the course of one-year study period. The colony prevalence increased from 5% in February to 68% in May and then decreased to 25% in June and 22% in July. Despite that pathogenicity of spiroplasmas in honey bee colonies remains to be determined, our results indicated that spiroplasma infections need to be included for the consideration of the impacts on honey bee health.
