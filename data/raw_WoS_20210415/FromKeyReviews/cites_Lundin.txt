Part 2: impacts on organisms and ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												New information on the lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and fipronil on organisms is presented in this review, complementing the previous Worldwide Integrated Assessment (WIA) in 2015. The high toxicity of these systemic insecticides to invertebrates has been confirmed and expanded to include more species and compounds. Most of the recent research has focused on bees and the sublethal and ecological impacts these insecticides have on pollinators. Toxic effects on other invertebrate taxa also covered predatory and parasitoid natural enemies and aquatic arthropods. Little new information has been gathered on soil organisms. The impact on marine and coastal ecosystems is still largely uncharted. The chronic lethality of neonicotinoids to insects and crustaceans, and the strengthened evidence that these chemicals also impair the immune system and reproduction, highlights the dangers of this particular insecticidal class (neonicotinoids and fipronil), with the potential to greatly decrease populations of arthropods in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Sublethal effects on fish, reptiles, frogs, birds, and mammals are also reported, showing a better understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity of these insecticides in vertebrates and their deleterious impacts on growth, reproduction, and neurobehaviour of most of the species tested. This review concludes with a summary of impacts on the ecosystem services and functioning, particularly on pollination, soil biota, and aquatic invertebrate communities, thus reinforcing the previous WIA conclusions (van der Sluijs et al. 2015).

A perception survey on how beekeepers perceive and manage factors related to climate change, Varroa infestation, management practices, and pesticide exposure was designed and launched online. This unpreceded sociological survey involved 355 beekeepers spread all over Belgium. A two-sample t test with unequal variances comparing beekeepers with colony loss rates below or exceeding the acceptable level, that is <10% and >= 10%, indicates that beekeepers (N = 213) with colony loss rates <10% generally have greater average levels of perceived risks and the benefits of action that lead to increased motivation to act in better ways. The results of this survey highlight the importance of looking beyond socio-economic determinants in any risk mitigation strategy associated with bee mortality when dealing with amateur beekeepers.

Although recent studies have detected neonicotinoid residues in honeys from around the world, little is known about how residues relate to land use and vegetation composition. To investigate potential relationships, we sampled multi-floral honey from 30 Apis mellifera hives from urban, agricultural and semi-natural habitats (SNH), identified and quantified three neonicotinoids present (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiacloprid) using UHPLC-MS, and classified surrounding land use up to 5 km around hive sites. Neonicotinoids were most frequently detected in honeys from hives in agricultural habitats, and 70% of all samples contained at least one of the three neonicotinoid compounds. Imidacloprid was the most frequently detected neonicotinoid (found in 43% of honey samples) followed by clothianidin (40%) and thiacloprid (37%). Almost half (48%) of samples contained at least two neonicotinoids, and two of the 30 samples contained all three. Clothianidin and thiacloprid were more frequently detected in honeys from urban habitats, highlighting that exposure to pesticides does not just occur in agricultural settings. This suggests that pesticide use in urban domestic, sport and amenity contexts, given potential exposure of bees and other pollinators, needs urgent consideration.																	0944-1344	1614-7499															10.1007/s11356-021-12564-y		FEB 2021					WOS:000613992300005	33528772

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the response of the stingless bee Nannotrigona aff. testaceicornis (Lepeletier, 1836) to a promising source of new insecticide molecules obtained from Lippia sidoides (rosemary pepper) essential oil (EO) and its major compounds (thymol, rho-cymene, and (E)-caryophyllene), comparing them to commercial insecticides (organosynthetic: imidacloprid, deltamethrin and semisynthetic: spinetoram). For this, stingless bees were exposed by contact with these compounds to evaluate the lethal and sublethal (locomotion and flight orientation) toxicity. The L. sidoides EO and its major compounds have low lethal toxicity to forager worker bees (N. aff. testaceicornis). The organosynthetics imidacloprid (LD50 = 0.00146 mu g bee(-1)) and deltamethrin (LD50 = 0.0096 mu g bee(-1)) were about 209,589 and 31,875 times more toxic, respectively, than the least toxic natural compound, (E)-caryophyllene (LD50 = 306 mu g bee(-1)). Locomotion ability and flight orientation were little affected by spinetoram and by L. sidoides EO and its major compounds, however, were greatly reduced by the imidacloprid and deltamethrin insecticides. Besides shows low lethal and sublethal toxicity, the bioinsecticides were also avoided by the forager bees. Individuals treated with the L. sidoides EO and thymol were avoided by the untreated bees. Therefore, the natural products studied here were promising due to their recognized effectiveness against pest insects and greater safety to bees N. aff. testaceicornis.

However, little has empirically shown whether poor air quality indeed affects foraging performance (foraging trip duration) of honeybee. Here, we show apparent increases in the average duration of honeybee foraging during and after a heavy air pollution event compared with that of the pre-event period. The average foraging duration of honeybees during the event increased by 32 min compared with the pre-event conditions, indicating that 71% more time was spent on foraging. Moreover, the average foraging duration measured after the event did not recover to its pre-event level. We further investigated whether an optical property (Depolarization Ratio, DR) of dominant PM in the atmosphere and level of air pollution (fine PM mass concentration) affect foraging trip duration. The result demonstrates the DR and fine PM mass concentration have significant effects on honeybee foraging trip duration. Foraging trip duration increases with decreasing DR while it increases with increasing fine PM mass concentration. In addition, the effects of fine PM mass concentration are synergistic with overcast skies. Our study implies that poor air quality could pose a new threat to bee foraging.

Previous studies have reported sublethal effects of glyphosate on honeybees. However, the effects of commercially formulated glyphosate (CFG) at the recommended concentration (RC) on the chronic toxicity of honeybees, especially on their behaviours, remain unknown. In this study, a series of behavioural experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of CFG on honeybees. The results showed that there was a significant decline in water responsiveness at 1/2x, 1xand 2xthe RC after 3 h of exposure to CFG for 11 days. The CFG significantly reduced sucrose responsiveness at 1/2xand 1xthe RC. In addition, CFG significantly affected olfactory learning ability at 1/2x, 1x, and 2xthe RC and negatively affected memory ability at 1/2xand 1xthe RC. The climbing ability of honeybees also significantly decreased at 1/2x, 1xand 2xthe RC. Our findings indicated that, after they were chronically exposed to CFG at the RC, honeybees exhibited behavioural changes. These results provide a theoretical basis for regulating field applications of CFG, which is necessary for establishing an early warning and notification system and for protecting honeybees.																	2045-2322					JAN 22	2021	11	1							2115	10.1038/s41598-020-80445-4							WOS:000613018600004	33483522

Toxic responses of blue orchard mason bees (Osmia lignaria) following contact exposure to neonicotinoids, macrocyclic lactones, and pyrethroids	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Analysis of particulate matter originating from beef cattle feed yards on the High Plains of the United States has revealed occurrence of multiple pesticides believed to potentially impact non-Apis pollinators. Among these pesticides are those that are highly toxic to Apis mellifera (honey bees). However, little non-Apis bee species toxicity data exist; especially pertaining to beef cattle feed yard-derived pesticides. Therefore, we conducted a series of 96-h contact toxicity tests with blue orchard mason bees (Osmia lignaria) using three neonicotinoids, two pyrethroids, and two macrocyclic lactones. Neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, and clothianidin) were most toxic with LD(50 v)alues ranging from 2.88 to 26.35 ng/bee, respectively. Macrocyclic lactones (abamectin and ivermectin) were also highly toxic to O. lignaria with LD50 estimates of 5.51-32.86 ng/bee. Pyrethroids (permethrin and bifenthrin) were relatively less toxic with LD50 values greater than 33 ng/bee. Sensitivity ratios for each pesticide were calculated to relate O. lignaria LD50 values to existing honey bee toxicity data. All three neonicotinoids were more toxic to O. lignaria than A. mellifera, but pyrethroids and abamectin were relatively less toxic. Additionally, three of seven pesticides (43%) resulted in significantly different mass normalized LD50 values for male and female O. lignaria. These results indicate that non-Apis pollinators may be highly susceptible to pesticides originating from beef cattle feed yards, necessitating consideration of more stringent regulatory protections than those based on A. mellifera pesticide sensitivity.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				JAN 15	2021	208								111681	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111681							WOS:000604142200004	33396013

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous regulators of gene expression. In this study, we initially determined that the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of dinotefuran was 0.773 mg/l. Then, the expression profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) in honey bee brains after 1, 5, and 10 d of treatment with the lethal concentration 10 (LC10) of dinotefuran were explored via deep small-RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In total, 2, 23, and 27 DE miRNAs were identified after persistent exposure to the LC10 of dinotefuran for 1, 5, and 10 d, respectively. Some abundant miRNAs, such as ame-miR-375-3p, ame-miR-281-5p, ame-miR-3786-3p, ame-miR-10-5p, and ame-miR-6037-3p, were extremely significantly differentially expressed. Enrichment analysis suggested that the candidate target genes of the DE miRNAs are involved in the regulation of biological processes, cellular processes, and behaviors. These results expand our understanding of the regulatory roles of miRNAs in honey bee Apis mellifera (Hymenopptera: Apidae) responses to neonicotinoid insecticides and facilitate further studies on the functions of miRNAs in honey bees.

A three-year large scale study on the risk of honey bee colony exposure to blooming sunflowers grown from seeds treated with thiamethoxam and clothianidin neonicotinoids	CHEMOSPHERE												Despite the restriction of the use of neonicotinoids in the EU, including thiamethoxam and clothianidin, the debate over their risk on honey bees has not been fully settled. This study presents results of a three-year study working with 180 honey bee colonies in ten replicates. Colonies were sorted into three treatments (60 colonies per treatment) exposed to sunflower blooms grown from seeds treated with thiamethoxam, clothianidin and a non-treated control. Each colony was assessed at six moments: one before to exposition to sunflower, two during the exposition (short-time risk), two after exposition (medium-time risk) and one after wintering (long-time risk). The health and development of the colonies were assessed by monitoring adult bee population, brood development, status of the queen, food reserves and survival. No significant difference among treatments when raw data was considered. However, when evolution from initial status of the colony was evaluated, a significant difference was observed from the first week of exposure to sunflower blooms. In this period, the number of adult bees and the amount of brood were slightly lower in the bee hives exposed to neonicotinoids, although such differences disappeared in subsequent evaluations. The concentration of residues in samples of beebread and adult bees was at the level of ng.g(-1). Magnitude of the effect of the treatment factor on the variability of colony health and development related parameters was low. The most important factor was the hive, followed by the replicate and year, and to a lesser extent the initial strength of the colonies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two sample preparation methods were tested: solid-phase extraction and the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. The identities of analytes were confirmed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in the selected reaction monitoring mode. Solid-phase extraction resulted in cleaner extracts; therefore, the SPE-LC-MS/MS method was validated according to the SANTE protocol in triplicate at two spiking levels (10 ng/g and 50 ng/g). The average recoveries of analytes ranged from 61% to 101%, except for clothianidin (10-20%). The LOD ranged from 0.2 ng/g to 4.4 ng/g, whereas the LOQ was in the range of 0.8 ng/g-14.7 ng/g. In order to compensate for the matrix effect, matrix-matched calibration was used. Good accuracy (relative error: 1.9-10.4%) and good linearity (R-2 > 0.991) were obtained for all compounds. The optimised method was applied to 30 samples: 18 raw propolis and 12 ethanol tinctures. Acetamiprid, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid were detectable in seven samples but were still below the LOQ. This study is the first to report the determination of several neonicotinoid residues in propolis.

One of the most debated factors contributing to bee population declines is exposure to pesticides, especially neonicotinoids. The most important Chinese indigenous species, Apis cerana presents a high risk on exposure to neonicotinoids, but few studies have explored the sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on Apis cerana. In this study, we highlight the molecular mechanism underlying the A. cerana toxicological characteristic against imidacloprid, the most commonly detected neonicotinoid in honey samples from Apis cerana. We not only investigated the physiological effects from sublethal doses of imidacloprid, but also identified several genes involved in a general stress response, including metabolism, catalytic activity, and structural molecule activity, response to stimulus, transporter activity, and signal transducer activity, as indicated by the GO analysis. In addition, genes related to the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and mTOR signaling pathway as indicated in the KEGG analysis were significantly up-related in the exposed bees. Overall, this study reveals the short-term sublethal effects of imidacloprid, which may be useful for accurately assessing the toxicity risk of Asian honeybees. Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) is the most important Chinese indigenous species, while its toxicological characteristic against neonicotinoids is poorly known. Here, we combined physiological experiments with a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to understand the molecular basis of genetic variation that responds to sublethal imidacloprid at different exposure durations in A. cerana. We found that LC5 dose of imidacloprid had a negative impact on climbing ability and sucrose responsiveness in A. cerana. When bees were fed with LC5 dose of imidacloprid, the enzyme activities of P450 and CarE were decreased, while the GSTs activity was not influenced by the pesticide exposure. The dynamic transcriptomic profiles of A. cerana workers exposed to LC5 dose of imidacloprid for 1 h, 8 h, and 16 h were obtained by high-throughput RNA-sequencing. We performed the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through trend analysis, and conducted the gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis with DEGs in up- and down-regulated pattern profiles. We observed that more genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and structural molecule activity are down-regulated; while more up-regulated genes were enriched in terms associated with response to stimulus, transporter activity, and signal transducer activity. Additionally, genes related to the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and mTOR signaling pathway as indicated in the KEGG analysis were significantly up-related in the exposed bees. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian honey bee in response to neonicotinoids sublethal toxicity, and could be used to further investigate the complex molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress.																		2075-4450				NOV	2020	11	11							753	10.3390/insects11110753							WOS:000593246300001	33153109

However, there is limited information about the effect of these stressors on other pollinators such as stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Meliponini). We examined the separate and combined effects of N. ceranae and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam at field-exposure levels on the survivorship and cellular immunity (hemocyte concentration) of the stingless bee Melipona colimana. Newly-emerged bees were subjected to four treatments provided in sucrose syrup: N. ceranae spores, thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam and N. ceranae, and control (bees receiving only syrup). N. ceranae developed infections of > 467,000 spores/bee in the group treated with spores only. However, in the bees subjected to both stressors, infections were < 143,000 spores/bee, likely due to an inhibitory effect of thiamethoxam on the microsporidium. N. ceranae infections did not affect bee survivorship, but thiamethoxam plus N. ceranae significantly increased mortality. Hemocyte counts were significantly lower in N. ceranae infected-bees than in the other treatments. These results suggest that N. ceranae may infect, proliferate and cause cellular immunosuppression in stingless bees, that exposure to sublethal thiamethoxam concentrations is toxic to M. colimana when infected with N. ceranae, and that thiamethoxam restrains N. ceranae proliferation. These findings have implications on pollinators' conservation.

J	Willoughby, IH; Moore, R; Moffat, AJ; Forster, J; Sayyed, I; Leslie, K				Willoughby, Ian H.; Moore, Roger; Moffat, Andrew J.; Forster, Jack; Sayyed, Imam; Leslie, Kerstin			Are there viable chemical and non-chemical alternatives to the use of conventional insecticides for the protection of young trees from damage by the large pine weevil Hylobius abietis L. in UK forestry?	FORESTRY												In UK forestry, the synthetic pyrethroid insecticides alpha-cypermethrin and cypermethrin have been used for many years to provide protection for young trees planted on restock sites from damage by the large pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L. However, concerns over the toxicity of these insecticides to aquatic life if misused have led to a search for alternative forms of protection. This paper describes a detailed programme of efficacy experiments undertaken between 2009 and 2015 to find replacements for these products. Over 50 combinations of chemical and non-chemical approaches were tested on 16 different sites. Of the alternative synthetic insecticides tested, applications of 0.037 g a.i. stem(-1) acetamiprid provided high levels of protection from Hylobius browsing damage on young Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriere) trees, without causing any phytotoxic symptoms, and gave comparable levels of protection to those achievable using alpha-cypermethrin or cypermethrin. Acetamiprid is less toxic to aquatic life than alpha-cypermethrin or cypermethrin and has not been linked to bee decline. Applications of 0.0129 g a.i. stem(-1) chlorantraniliprole also showed promise, and this relatively low toxicity non-neonicotinoid insecticide merits further study. Although imidacloprid and thiacloprid also provided good levels of protection, their use in forests is not now permitted due to concerns over their potential impacts on bees and drinking water, respectively. Whilst the natural product insecticide spinosad, and the entomopathogenic fungal control agent Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschn.) Sorokin, gave only limited protection in our work, they may have some future potential if methods of deployment can be improved. Other chemical and non-chemical approaches tested, but found to be largely ineffective in UK conditions, included the natural product insecticides azadirachtin, maltodextrin and pyrethrins, the synthetic insecticides lambda-cyhalothrin and spirotetramat and a wide range of repellents, flexible stem coatings and physical barrier products. However, we conclude that physical barrier sleeves such as MultiPro (R) and BioSleeve (R) may have a limited role as a partial substitute for the use of insecticides in the UK in some circumstances, but only if on-site populations of Hylobius are predicted to be low.																	0015-752X	1464-3626				OCT	2020	93	5					694	712		10.1093/forestry/cpaa013							WOS:000589651000010

To optimise crop yield, the cocoa trees require spraying with neonicotinoid insecticides (Imidacloprid, Thiacloprid Acetamiprid and Thiamethoxam). It is proposed that rainwater runoff from the treated area may pollute the Owena River and that these pesticides may thereby enter the human food chain via six species of fish (Clariasgariepinus,Clariasanguillaris,Sarotherodongalilaeus,Parachannaobscura,OreochromisniloticusandGymnarchusniloticus) which are cultured in the river mostly for local consumption. This work aims to establish a working method to quantify the likely levels of the insecticides in the six species of fish, firstly by undertaking a laboratory-based study employing the QuEChERS method to extract the four neonicotinoids from fish purchased in marketplace in the UK, spiked with known quantities of the pesticide and using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) as the detection method; secondly, by using these samples to optimise the detection method for very low levels of pesticides, then applying the optimised techniques to the analysis of three of each six species of fish taken from the Owena River. A significant benefit of this combined technique is that only small samples of fish are required. Success with this part of the study showed that very low concentrations of the insecticides could be detected in fish muscle. The third aim is to apply a simple quantitative risk assessment model using the data sets obtained, together with information about daily diet, human body weight and recommended safety limits of pesticides in food to illustrate how human health may be affected by the consumption of these fish. The multiple determinations of neonicotinoids in edible fishes in Nigeria are pioneer research and fill a gap in addressing the relationship between waterborne pesticides and food quality in the country. Fundamentally, this work is an exercise to demonstrate the applicability of the aforementioned instrumental method of analysis to fish muscle, which requires only a small sample size of fish; a large number of fish is not required for a proof of concept, in this case. Although not a monitoring programme for the whole Owena River Basin ecosystemper se, this work successfully demonstrates the technical feasibility of a system of chemical analysis and establishes the foundation for ecological surveys in the immediate future. Parameters involving exposures to xenobiotics in ecotoxicological modelling can now be expressed in terms of both mass and molar concentrations of a chemical in animal tissues if so desired.

While several retailers have announced mandatory labeling policies for plants treated with neonicotinoids, little is known about how individual consumers react to a firm's disclosure of neonicotinoid use in production and the extent to which this additional information is valued. Here, we use a laboratory experiment to assess consumers' preferences for environmentally friendly production practices, focusing on neonicotinoid labeling. Despite broad consumer unfamiliarity with neonicotinoids, results show that consumers have differentiated preferences for neonicotinoid-related labels and information disclosure.																	1068-5502	2327-8285				SEP	2020	45	3					496	+		10.22004/ag.econ.302462							WOS:000576266100007

However, the extensive use of pesticides in tomato cultures may be harmful to bees. Imidacloprid-based insecticides are used in tomato plantations because of its high efficiency against tomato pests. This study investigated the effects of oral intake of field-realistic concentrations of imidacloprid byM. quadrifasciataworkers, a stingless native bee from Brazil and effective pollinators of tomato crops. The oral intake of sucrose syrup added with 10, 35, or 70 ppb of imidacloprid did not increase the mortality rate when compared with the control group. However, we observed a reduction in the workers' motility and food consumption. We also treatedM. quadrifasciataworkers with sucrose syrup mixed with an imidacloprid-based insecticide (Evidence 700 WG (R), Bayer), with the final concentration of 250 ppb of imidacloprid. This treatment did not cause visible alterations of the intestine absorptive cells of the bees' midgut and did not increase DNA damage. Therefore, the observed reduction of food consumption and locomotion behavior ofM. quadrifasciataworkers may contribute to the global effort to understand the contribution of neonicotinoids on bees' population decline process.

Agricultural landscape composition affects the development and life expectancy of colonies ofBombus impatiens	ECOSPHERE												Bumble bees are essential, efficient pollinators of numerous crops, and scientists are increasingly concerned about their global decline. Although several potential causes have been put forward, the concurrent modification of landscape structure and pesticide use by agriculture are often pointed out as the main drivers of the decline. Yet, the mechanisms through which these factors cause species to decline remain elusive. Most field studies have been conducted at the individual level, and the few studies that addressed higher levels of organization only covered narrow ecological conditions. We undertook a field experiment in spring 2016 to overcome these limitations by placing four commercialBombus impatienscolonies in each of 20 sites located along a gradient of agricultural intensity in southern Quebec, Canada. We hypothesized that landscape habitat composition and configuration, as well as local floral resources, would affect colony development. We expected colonies surrounded by low-intensity and/or flowering crops in heterogeneous landscapes to develop better and live longer, partly linked to more abundant and diversified food resources, than colonies embedded in landscapes dominated by high-intensity crops. Colonies were weighed once a week, and workers were captured to assess pollen load diversity. Final colony weight, queen production, and presence of depredators (Aphomia sociella, Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were also recorded. Landscape habitat composition and configuration were characterized within 1 km of colonies. Local availability of floral resources was assessed within 100 m of colonies every two weeks. As predicted, colony weight and longevity decreased with the proportion of intensive crops and increased with the amount of flowering crops, but queen production and the occurrence ofA. sociellawere not affected by landscape composition. Contrary to our prediction, local availability of floral resources also did not affect colonies. The pollen richness brought back to colonies decreased with the proportion of flowering crops and varied according to the proportion of intensive crops interacting with local floral resources. Our work contributes to generalize the more restrictive conclusion of local-scale, crop-specific studies that intensive crop farming undermines bumble bee colony development and that it may thus play a role in the large-scale population decline of these insects.

We present a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of contamination to insecticides, herbicides and fungicides of products from honeybees, and an estimation of how much the consumption of these products contributes to the ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) of selected substances. Objectives: We aim to systematically review and meta-analyse studies on the contamination to plant protection products in honey, royal jelly, beeswax and propolis, applying the Navigation Guide and WHO-ILO systematic review methodology as an organizing framework. Data sources: We will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from PubMed, TOXNET and EMBASE. We will include quantitative studies analysing the contamination from insecticides, herbicides and fungicides in honey, propolis, royal jelly and beeswax. In particular, we will evaluate the presence of the following substances and classes of pesticides: Glyphosate, Chlorpyrifos, pyrethroid and neonicotinoid pesticides, fungicides and acaricides. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: At least two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts at a first stage of review, and full texts at a second stage, of potentially eligible records against the eligibility criteria; data extraction of included studies will then be performed by at least two authors, in blind. At least two authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. The data on prevalence of contaminated samples and concentration of pesticides in the products will be combined using meta-analysis: when more than three studies reporting the necessary measures to fit the models are available, meta-analysis will be performed separately by product and by exposure; otherwise, weighted descriptive analysis will be performed. We will report the results using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA).

Can anthophilous hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) discriminate neonicotinoid insecticides in sucrose solution?	PLOS ONE												Understanding how neonicotinoid insecticides affect non-target arthropods, especially pollinators, is an area of high priority and popular debate. Few studies have considered how pollinators interact and detect neonicotinoids, and almost none have examined for these effects in anthophilous Diptera such as hover flies (Syrphidae). We investigated behavioral responses of two species of hover flies,Eristalis arbustorumL. (Eristalinae) andToxomerus marginatusSay (Syrphinae), when given a choice between artificial flowers with uncontaminated sucrose solution and neonicotinoid-contaminated (clothianidin) sucrose solution at field-realistic levels 2.5 ppb (average) and 150 ppb (high). We examined for 1) evidence that wild-caught flies could detect the insecticide gustatorily by analyzing amount of time spent feeding on floral treatments, and 2) whether flies could discriminate floral treatments visually by comparing visitation rates, spectral reflectance differences, and hover fly photoreceptor sensitivities. We did not find evidence that either species fed more or less on either of the treatment solutions. Furthermore,T.marginatusdid not appear to visit one of the flower choices over the other.Eristalis arbustorum, however, visited uncontaminated flowers more often than contaminated flowers. Spectral differences between the flower treatments overlap withEristalisphotoreceptor sensitivities, opening the possibility thatE.arbustorumcould discriminate sucrose-clothianidin solution visually. The relevance of our findings in field settings are uncertain but they do highlight the importance of visual cues in lab-based choice experiments involving insecticides. We strongly encourage further research in this area and the consideration of both behavioral responses and sensory mechanisms when determining insecticidal impacts on beneficial arthropods.

Part 4: Alternatives in major cropping systems	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												We present a synthetic review and expert consultation that assesses the actual risks posed by arthropod pests in four major crops, identifies targets for integrated pest management (IPM) in terms of cultivated land needing pest control and gauges the implementation "readiness" of non-chemical alternatives. Our assessment focuses on the world's primary target pests for neonicotinoid-based management: western corn rootworm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) in maize; wireworms (Agriotes spp.) in maize and winter wheat; bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) in winter wheat; brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) in rice; cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) and silver-leaf whitefly (SLW, Bemisia tabaci) in cotton. First, we queried scientific literature databases and consulted experts from different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia about available IPM tools for each crop-pest system. Next, using an online survey, we quantitatively assessed the economic relevance of target pests by compiling country-level records of crop damage, yield impacts, extent of insecticide usage, and "readiness" status of various pest management alternatives (i.e., research, plot-scale validation, grower-uptake). Biological control received considerable scientific attention, while agronomic strategies (e.g., crop rotation), insurance schemes, decision support systems (DSS), and innovative pesticide application modes were listed as key alternatives. Our study identifies opportunities to advance applied research, IPM technology validation, and grower education to halt or drastically reduce our over-reliance on systemic insecticides globally.

Upon returning, the affected bees were unable to enter the hive because of unbalanced flying and walking. Deaths were seen at apiaries located on plains or near plains where maize seeds were sowed. When winds blew from the direction of the plains towards the hives, honey bee deaths increased, but when the weather was rainy, honey bee deaths decreased or stopped. Honey bee losses were mainly between 30% and 80%. Investigations related to the honey bee deaths were carried out in the affected apiaries using on-site inspection and laboratory tests. The main reason of deaths would be linked to the clothianidin coated maize seeds used in the plain during sowing period. No remarkable correlation with any bee pathogens was detected related to the sudden and prevalent honey bee deaths.

Field studies on whole colonies are limited in behavioural research, while results from lab studies allow only restricted conclusions on whole colony impacts. Methods for automated long-term investigations of behaviours within comb cells, such as brood care, were hitherto missing. In the present study, we demonstrate an innovative video method that enables within-cell analysis in honey bee (Apis mellifera) observation hives to detect chronic sublethal neonicotinoid effects of clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) and thiacloprid (200 ppb) on worker behaviour and development. In May and June, colonies which were fed 10 ppb clothianidin and 200 ppb thiacloprid in syrup over three weeks showed reduced feeding visits and duration throughout various larval development days (LDDs). On LDD 6 (capping day) total feeding duration did not differ between treatments. Behavioural adaptation was exhibited by nurses in the treatment groups in response to retarded larval development by increasing the overall feeding timespan. Using our machine learning algorithm, we demonstrate a novel method for detecting behaviours in an intact hive that can be applied in a versatile manner to conduct impact analyses of chemicals, pests and other stressors.

No evidence for neonicotinoid preferences in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												Neonicotinoid pesticides can have a multitude of negative sublethal effects on bees. Understanding their impact on wild populations requires accurately estimating the dosages bees encounter under natural conditions. This is complicated by the possibility that bees might influence their own exposure: two recent studies found that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) preferentially consumed neonicotinoid-contaminated nectar, even though these chemicals are thought to be tasteless and odourless. Here, we used Bombus impatiens to explore two elements of these reported preferences, with the aim of understanding their ecological implication and underlying mechanism. First, we asked whether preferences persisted across a range of realistic nectar sugar concentrations, when measured at a series of time points up until 24 h. Second, we tested whether bees' neonicotinoid preferences were driven by an ability to associate their post-ingestive consequences with floral stimuli such as colour, location or scent. We found no evidence that foragers preferred to consume neonicotinoid-containing solutions, despite finding effects on feeding motivation and locomotor activity in line with previous work. Bees also did not preferentially visit floral stimuli previously paired with a neonicotinoid-containing solution. These results highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying bees' responses to these pesticides, critical for determining how neonicotinoid-driven foraging preferences might operate in the real world for different bee species.																	2054-5703					MAY 20	2020	7	5							191883	10.1098/rsos.191883							WOS:000537255600001	32537195

Thiamethoxam impairs honey bee visual learning, alters decision times, and increases abnormal behaviors	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Learning is important for honey bee fitness and the pollination services that they provide. Neonicotinoid pesticides impair learning, fitness, colony health, and pollination, but most studies on how they affect bee learning have focused on olfactory learning. We tested the effects of field realistic doses of 0.8 ng/bee and 1.34 ng/bee of the neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam (TMX), on bee visual learning. We adapted a T-maze bioassay and classically conditioned bees to associate sugar reward with a simulated flower color (blue or yellow light) in a choice assay. At 1.34 ng/bee, TMX significantly reduced correct choices in the final learning trial as compared to the control treatment. There was no TMX effect in our 1-h memory test. We found stronger effects on decision time and abnormal behaviors. TMX decreased bee decision times, a potential byproduct of induced hyperactivity since bees walked to make choices. Behaviors (falling, trembling, and rapid abnormal movements) were significantly increased by both TMX doses as compared to the control treatment. These results suggest that the effects of neonicotinoids on bee visual learning should be further studied and incorporated into Risk Assessment protocols.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				APR 15	2020	193								110367	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110367							WOS:000521519900014	32113123

Exposure of Foraging Bees (Hymenoptera) to Neonicotinoids in the US Southern High Plains	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Exposure to pesticides is a major threat to insect pollinators, potentially leading to negative effects that could compromise pollination services and biodiversity. The objectives of this study were to quantify neonicotinoid concentrations among different bee genera and to examine differences attributable to body size and surrounding land use. During the period of cotton planting (May-June), 282 wild bees were collected from habitat patches associated with cropland, grassland, and urban land cover and analyzed for three neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid). Twenty bees among eight genera contained one or more of the neonicotinoid compounds and detections occurred in all landscape types, yet with the most detections occurring in cropland-associated habitats. Apis Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae), Melissodes Latreille (Apidae), Perdita Smith (Andrenidae), and Lasioglossum Curtis (Halictidae) had multiple individuals with neonicotinoid detections. Two of the largest bees (Apis and Melissodes) had the greatest number of detections within genera, yet the relatively small-bodied genus Perdita had the three highest neonicotinoid concentrations reported. The number of detections within a genus and average generic body mass showed a marginally significant trend towards larger bees having a greater frequency of neonicotinoid detections. Overall, the relatively low percentage of detections across taxa suggests practices aimed at conserving grassland remnants in intensified agricultural regions could assist in mitigating exposure of wild bees to agrochemicals, while differences in bee traits and resource use could in part drive exposure. Further work is needed to address variable agrochemical exposures among pollinators, to support strategies for conservation and habitat restoration in affected landscapes.

Imidacloprid impairs performance on a model flower handling task in bumblebees (Bombus impatiens)	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Bumblebees exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides collect less pollen on foraging trips. Exposed bumblebees are also slower to learn to handle flowers, which may account for reduced pollen collection. It is unclear, however, why neonicotinoid exposure slows learning to handle flowers. We investigated the effect of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, on bumblebee motor learning using a lab model of flower handling. Bumblebees learned to invert inside a narrow tube and lift a petal-shaped barrier to reach a reward chamber. Imidacloprid-exposed bumblebees showed a dose-dependent delay to solve the task, which resulted from reduced switching between behavioural strategies and a subsequent delay in use of the successful strategy. This effect was consistent in colonies exposed at 10 but not 2.6 ppb, suggesting a variable effect on individuals at lower doses. These results help to explain why exposed bumblebees are slow to learn to handle flowers and collect less pollen on foraging trips.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				APR	2020	29	3					359	374		10.1007/s10646-020-02182-8		MAR 2020					WOS:000517693600002	32124147

Lethal and sublethal effects of toxicants on bumble bee populations: a modelling approach	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Pollinator decline worldwide is well-documented; globally, chemical pesticides (especially the class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids) have been implicated in hymenopteran decline, but the mechanics and drivers of population trends and dynamics of wild bees is poorly understood. Declines and shifts in community composition of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have been documented in North America and Europe, with a suite of lethal and sub-lethal effects of pesticides on bumble bee populations documented. We employ a mathematical model parameterized with values taken from the literature that uses differential equations to track bumble bee populations through time in order to attain a better understanding of toxicant effects on a developing colony of bumble bees. We use a delay differential equation (DDE) model, which requires fewer parameter estimations than agent-based models while affording us the ability to explicitly describe the effect of larval incubation and colony history on population outcomes. We explore how both lethal and sublethal effects such as reduced foraging ability may combine to affect population outcomes, and discuss the implications for the protection and conservation of ecosystem services.

JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH												Bees that forage in agricultural plantations and surroundings are exposed to pesticide residues, which can cause sublethal effects in individuals and consequently compromise the performance of the colony. Regarding the honey bees, beekeepers can be hampered by decreased production of honey and other bee products. Although the effects of insecticides on bees are widely studied for obvious reasons, there is growing evidence that fungicides, too, are not harmless to bees. However, further studies are needed on the effects caused by fungicide residues present in pollen and nectar which are collected and consumed by honey bees. For this reason, we aimed to perform a histopathological diagnosis and cell death immunolabeling in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of Africanized honey bee workers throughout continuous oral exposure (24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h) to low concentrations of picoxystrobin (9 ppb and 18 ppb), a strobilurin fungicide. Although there were no histopathological effects on the Malpighian tubules, an organ that plays a role in excretion, these effects were observed in the midgut of bees exposed to both concentrations of picoxystrobin. Morphological alterations, as well as positive-labeling for cell death, were observed in the midgut of exposed bees over time (from 24 to 96 h after the beginning of exposure). Although the data have shown evidence of intestinal epithelial renewal in response to cytotoxic effects, i.e., recovery after short-time exposure, this organ may have its nutrient absorption functions compromised in the long-term, which may lead to symptoms of malnutrition and affect the individual's performance, which could, in turn, affect the whole colony.

One way to reduce pesticides application is management using resistant plants as one of the highlights of integrated pest management programs. The first step to obtaining commercial pest-resistant cultivars is the selection of resistant plant genotypes in the breeding programs of plants. Thus, this study aimed to utilize preference and performance responses of T. mexicanus in different passion fruit genotypes to determine the resistance to T. mexicanus. To identify antixenosis and antibiosis resistance, we evaluated the T. mexicanus preference and a life table experiment was conducted recording developmental time, survival, reproductive output, and longevity of T. mexicanus for the 25 genotypes. A total of 9 genotypes were the least preferred by the T. mexicanus and, thus were classified as the most resistant to this mite by the antixenosis mechanism. The genotype 4 was the one the affected the mite most negatively, reducing the females' longevity while a total of 14 genotypes were affected most negatively the fecundity of the mites. Therefore, we determined that the genotype 4 exhibits resistance trough antixenosis and antibiosis to the T. mexicanus and, thus, can be used as a source of resistance to this mite while seeking the production of cultivars resistant to this pest.

Neonicotinoid Insecticides: Molecular Targets, Resistance, and Toxicity	ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY, VOL 60	Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology											Neonicotinoids have been used to protect crops and animals from insect pests since the 1990s, but there are concerns regarding their adverse effects on nontarget organisms, notably on bees. Enhanced resistance to neonicotinoids in pests is becoming well documented.

J	Rundlof, M; Lundin, O				Rundlof, Maj; Lundin, Ola			Can Costs of Pesticide Exposure for Bumblebees Be Balanced by Benefits from a Mass-Flowering Crop?	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Mass-flowering crops provide forage for bees but also contain pesticides. Such pesticide exposure can harm bees, but our understanding of how this cost is balanced by forage benefits is limited. To provide insights into benefits and costs, we placed bumblebee colonies in 18 landscapes with conventional red clover fields treated with the neonicotinoid thiacloprid (flowers + pesticide), untreated organic red clover fields (flowers), or landscapes lacking clover fields (controls). Colonies grew heavier near thiacloprid-treated clover compared to controls lacking clover, while colonies near untreated clover did not differ from colonies in neither of the other landscape types. Thiacloprid treatment effectively controlled pests and increased bumblebee crop visitation. However, colony production of queens and males did not differ among landscape types. In conclusion, thiacloprid application in clover appears to be of low risk for bumblebees. More generally, neonicotinoids may not be equally harmful when used in flowering crops and effective low-risk pest control in such crops could potentially benefit bumblebees and crop pollination.

J	Brodie, J; Landos, M				Brodie, Jon; Landos, Matt			Pesticides in Queensland and Great Barrier Reef waterways - potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems and the failure of national management	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Pesticide residues are found ubiquitously in Queensland east coast and Great Barrier Reef (GBR) waterbodies. The highest concentrations, often above Australian guidelines, are found adjacent to and downstream of areas of intensive cropping, largely sugarcane cultivation and horticulture. Due to the iconic status of the GBR more information on pesticide levels, risk to ecosystems and management solutions are available than in other parts of Australia. Freshwater bodies being, in general, closer to the source of pesticide residues from intensive agriculture, have higher concentrations present than waterbodies further away from the agriculture e.g. estuarine and marine environments. As such pesticide residues present a higher risk in these waterbodies with a lowering of risk as ecosystems become further distant from the sources. Management of pesticides in Australia is a joint responsibility of the Australian and State governments. Management for environmental protection at the Australian level by the regulator, the Australian Pesticide and Veterinary Medicine Authority, has serious deficiencies in process and practice. However at the Queensland Government level action is being taken to reduce pesticide pollution of waterways, including research, monitoring, risk assessments and application of better pesticide application methods. However only limited progress is being made in reducing pesticide exposure. Given the large knowledge base of pesticide management methods available there is some hope that residue levels and risk to ecosystems can be reduced.																	0272-7714	1096-0015				DEC 15	2019	230								106447	10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106447							WOS:000505649500017

Fungicides, herbicides and bees: A systematic review of existing research and methods	PLOS ONE												Bees and the pollination services they deliver are beneficial to both food crop production, and for reproduction of many wild plant species. Bee decline has stimulated widespread interest in assessing hazards and risks to bees from the environment in which they live. While there is increasing knowledge on how the use of broad-spectrum insecticides in agricultural systems may impact bees, little is known about effects of other pesticides (or plant protection products; PPPs) such as herbicides and fungicides, which are used more widely than insecticides at a global scale. We adopted a systematic approach to review existing research on the potential impacts of fungicides and herbicides on bees, with the aim of identifying research approaches and determining knowledge gaps. While acknowledging that herbicide use can affect forage availability for bees, this review focussed on the potential impacts these compounds could have directly on bees themselves. We found that most studies have been carried out in Europe and the USA, and investigated effects on honeybees. Furthermore, certain effects, such as those on mortality, are well represented in the literature in comparison to others, such as sub-lethal effects. More studies have been carried out in the lab than in the field, and the impacts of oral exposure to herbicides and fungicides have been investigated more frequently than contact exposure. We suggest a number of areas for further research to improve the knowledge base on potential effects. This will allow better assessment of risks to bees from herbicides and fungicides, which is important to inform future management decisions around the sustainable use of PPPs.

We evaluated seed biopriming with rhizospheric strains of the bacteria Enterobacter asburiae and Bacillus cereus, and endophytic strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp. and Pantoea agglomerans. Seeds treated with E. cloacae and Enterobacter sp. presented higher germination potential, germination velocity index and accumulation of fresh biomass in the radicle than seeds that were untreated or treated with other bacteria. Seeds that were not treated were also most affected by fungi, in particular Fusarium and Penicillium, during storage. When treated with B. cereus and E. asburiae, fungal infestation of the stored seeds was reduced to levels similar to those found in seeds treated with chemical fungicide. Our combined analysis of the influence of these strains on radicular growth and the control of phytopathogens, indicates that the rhizospheric strains of B. cereus and E. asburiae may have the best potential for biocontrol. The present study also demonstrated that the microbiota associated with plants native to the Brazilian Cerrado may be a promising source of species or biomolecules with potential for the biocontrol of plant pathogens.																	0251-0952	1819-5717				DEC	2019	47	3					325	341		10.15258/sst.2019.47.3.08							WOS:000514174500008

Neonicotinoid pesticides present similar properties with nicotine, but the mentioned compounds are less harmful for humans. Nevertheless, neonicotinoids are poisonous to insects and some invertebrates, which can act against insects' central nervous system, leading to their death. Moreover, neonicotinoids can affect the reproduction, foraging, and flying ability of honeybee and other insects including pollinators. In the present study, some neonicotinoids, such as imidacloprid, acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam together with their toxic effects, have been presented. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies these neonicotinoids as II and III class toxicity agents. Due to accumulation of these pesticides into the pollen of treated plants, especially due to their toxic effects against pollinators, the consequences of the occurrence of these insecticides have been discussed. Analytical aspects and methods involved in the isolation and determination of this class of pesticides have been presented in this contribution.

In this study, we investigated residues in nine colonies at a model agricultural research site during the period before wintering. Moreover, we applied the acaricide tau-fluvalinate to the colonies via a strip formulation. The pesticide content was determined by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in bees from brood comb initially collected in mid-September immediately prior to the start of tau-fluvalinate treatment and 30 later at the time of tau-fluvalinate strip removal. RESULTSIn addition to commonly analyzed pesticides, we detected two plant growth regulators, chlormequat and metazachlor, in the bee colonies. Whereas thiacloprid, chlormequat and acetamiprid decreased after 30days and contributed considerably to differences between sample time points, other pesticides appeared to be rather stable. Interestingly, we identified diazinon, which has been banned in the European Union since 2007. The residues of methiocarb sulfoxide and imidacloprid-urea in the absence of their parent compounds indicate historical environmental contamination that can be identified by the detection of residues in a bee colony. tau-Fluvalinate was detected only after the 30-day treatment at an average (SD) concentration of 1.29 +/- 1.93ng/bee, ranging from 0.06 to 7.13ng/bee. CONCLUSIONThe multidimensional behavior of pesticides in a bee colony was indicated. Although the research area is used for agriculture, the measured pesticide level was relatively low. The recorded concentrations of tau-fluvalinate should not be dangerous to bees, as the values were similar to 200-5000-fold lower than the reported median lethal dose (LD50) values.

This study aims to evaluate and compare the acute and sublethal toxicity effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on three species of Trichogramma parasitoid wasps (i.e. Trichogramma dendrolimi, T. ostriniae and T. confusum) with broad distribution and great relevance to integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. A residual contact bioassay demonstrated that nitenpyram had the greatest intrinsic toxicity to T. dendrolimi and T. ostriniae with LC50 values of 0.060 (0.056-0.065) and 0.066 (0.050-0.087) mg a.i. L-1, respectively. But for T. confusum, the most toxic neonicotinoid insecticide is dinotefuran with a LC50 value of 0.065 (0.055-0.078) mg a.i. L-1. Furthermore, based on the risk quotient estimation, acetamiprid was considered to be the only safe neonicotinoid insecticide (Class 1, RQ < 50). A dipped egg contact bioassay showed that neonicotinoid insecticides induced significant toxic effects on the parasitism of three Trichogramma spp. at low-lethal concentrations. Additionally, emergence probability of the unexposed offspring was also significantly reduced by neonicotinoids. According to the estimated EC50 values, acetamiprid possessed the least toxicity to the parasitism and emergence of T. dendrolimi and T. ostriniae, and for T. confusum, the least toxic neonicotinoid insecticide was thiacloprid. Overall, among the test neonicotinoid insecticides, acetamiprid and thiacloprid may exhibit the less ecotoxicity to the test Trichogramma species.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				NOV 15	2019	183								109587	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109587							WOS:000487178000043	31509925

Besides synthetic insecticides biological compounds such as spinosad are used in agriculture and organic farming against insect pests. However, potential adverse effect at sublethal concentrations to pollinators are poorly known. Here we aim to determine potential adverse outcome pathways of spinosad and to identify molecular effects by investigating transcriptional alterations in the brain of honey bees. We experimentally exposed bees to three sublethal concentrations of 0.05, 0.5 and 5 ng spinosad/bee, and assessed transcriptional alterations of target genes. Additionally, we evaluated whether spinosad-induced transcriptional alterations were influenced by the time of the year. In April, alterations were most pronounced after 24 h exposure, while in June alterations occurred mostly after 48 h. In July, expressional alterations were often lower but the pattern was more similar to that in June than that in April. Down-regulation of genes encoding acetylcholine receptors, enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (cox5a, ndufb7 and cox17), cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases (cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3) and insulin-like peptide-1 were among the most significant transcriptional alterations. This suggests adverse effects of spinosad to energy production and metabolism and thus negative consequences on foraging. Together, our study indicates that spinosad causes adverse effects at environmentally realistic concentrations, which may pose a risk to bee populations.																	0304-3894	1873-3336				OCT 15	2019	378								120736	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.06.013							WOS:000489188300007	31202068

It is unclear how the developing brains of honey bee larvae are affected by sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides when measuring neural processes through behavioural performance in adult bees. In this study, larvae were exposed to three sublethal doses of clothianidin and evaluated 25-36 days later for hygienic and foraging behaviours as adult bees. The medium and highest sublethal doses of clothianidin significantly reduced hygienic and foraging activity. The greatest effects were on the proportion of adult bees foraging and carrying pollen. These results show that exposure of larvae to clothianidin results in negative effects extending into the adulthood of bees, possibly compromising the colony's fitness by impairing pathogen control mechanisms and by reducing pollen collection.

Here, we analyse transcriptional effects in the brain of honey bees of three frequently applied fungicides, azoxystrobin, chlorothanolin and folpet, after oral exposure for 24, 48 and 72 h. Among transcripts assessed were genes encoding proteins for immune and hormone system regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism, and acetylcholine receptor alpha 1. Azoxystrobin and folpet induced minor alterations, including down-regulation of hbg-3 by azoxystrobin and induction of ndufb-7 by folpet. Chlorothanolin induced strong transcriptional down regulation of genes encoding enzymes related to oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, including cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3, acetylcholine receptor alpha 1 and hbg-3 and ilp-1, which are linked to hormonal regulation and behavioural transition of honey bees. Exposures to chlorothanolin in different seasonal times showed different responsiveness; responses were faster and often stronger in April than in June. Chlorothanolin caused the strongest effects and affected transcriptional abundance of genes related to energy production, metabolism and the endocrine system. Disturbed energy production may reduce foraging activity and hormonal dysregulation, such as the transition of nurse bees to foragers. Further analyses are needed to further substantiate potential adverse effects of chlorothanolin in bees on the physiological level.																	0304-3894	1873-3336				SEP 5	2019	377						215	226		10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.05.056							WOS:000474676800025	31170570

Beekeepers often rely on flowering plants in and around irrigated farmland to maintain their colonies during dry seasons, despite the potential risk of pesticide exposure. Recent declines in pollinator abundance and diversity have focused attention on the role of pesticides and their effects on honey bee health. This investigation examined two types of landscapes within a two-mile (3.2 km) radius of honey bee colonies: an intensive agricultural setting and a rural setting without intensive agriculture. More than 10,000 acres of agricultural land was surveyed to quantify the area of cultivated crops and the area treated with pesticides, including seed treatments and foliar applications of insecticides. Samples of honey, bee bread (stored pollen), beeswax, and adult bees were collected from hives in both landscape types and screened for pesticide residues to determine if foraging bees were transporting pesticides to hives. Some samples of bee bread and honey did contain pesticide residues, but these were below known lethal dose (LD50) levels for honey bees. Beeswax samples contained the highest levels of contamination, but most were still relatively low. Samples were screened for 174 common agricultural pesticides and metabolites, but only 26 compounds were detected during the two-year study. These included one defoliant, one insect growth regulator, five herbicides, six fungicides, six insecticides never used in beekeeping, and five insecticides/miticides and their metabolites, which are used in beekeeping and for various other agricultural purposes, as well as two miticides exclusively used by beekeepers to control Varroa destructor. Bee colonies foraging in agricultural landscapes are potentially exposed to numerous pesticide applications. While the residues detected in this study did not pose an acute lethal risk to adult honey bees, this study did not measure sublethal effects on bee colony health or performance, which merit further investigation.

A review of the factors that influence pesticide residues in pollen and nectar: Future research requirements for optimising the estimation of pollinator exposure	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												In recent years, the impact of Plant Protection Products (PPPs) on insect pollinator decline has stimulated significant amounts of research, as well as political and public interest. PPP residues have been found in various bee-related matrices, resulting in governmental bodies worldwide releasing guidance documents on methods for the assessment of the overall risk of PPPs to different bee species. An essential part of these risk assessments are PPP residues found in pollen and nectar, as they represent a key route of exposure. However, PPP residue values in these matrices exhibit large variations and are not available for many PPPs and crop species combinations, which results in inaccurate estimations and uncertainties in risk evaluation. Additionally, residue studies on pollen and nectar are expensive and practically challenging. An extrapolation between different cropping scenarios and PPPs is not yet justified, as the behaviour of PPPs in pollen and nectar is poorly understood. Therefore, this review aims to contribute to a better knowledge and understanding of the fate of PPP residues in pollen and nectar and to outline knowledge gaps and future research needs. The literature suggests that four primary factors, the crop type, the application method, the physicochemical properties of a compound and the environmental conditions have the greatest influence on PPP residues in pollen and nectar. However, these factors consist of many sub-factors and initial effects may be disguised by different sampling methodologies, impeding their exact characterisation. Moreover, knowledge about these factors is ambiguous and restricted to a few compounds and plant species. We propose that future research should concentrate on identifying relationships and common features amongst various PPP applications and crops, as well as an overall quantification of the described parameters; in order to enable a reliable estimation of PPP residues in pollen, nectar and other bee matrices.

Effect of Sub-lethal Doses of Imidacloprid on Learning and Memory Formation of Indigenous Arabian Bee (Apis mellifera jemenitica Ruttner) Adult Foragers	NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The indigenous bee race Apis mellifera jemenitica Ruttner of Saudi Arabia can learn and retain memories established by the classical conditioning of proboscis extension response (PER). The insecticide imidacloprid has shown a drastic effect on the olfactory behavior of A. m. jemenitica in the harsh arid climatic conditions of central Saudi Arabia. The oral feeding of single imidacloprid sub-lethal doses (1.0ng, 0.5ng, or 0.1ng) under laboratory conditions significantly impaired associative learning during the 2nd and 3rd conditioning trials compared to control bees (0ng). The memory tests also revealed significant impairment in memory formation at 1h, 2h, and 24h after conditioning compared to control bees. Even the lowest dose (0.1ng/bee) can significantly impair the bees' ability to learn and memorize. This impairment effect was dose dependent and increased with increasing doses. The higher dose (1.0ng) completely impaired the learning but still showed a little memory and reflected the potential recovery of bees from insecticide-induced impairment with the passage of time. To our knowledge, this is the first study in A. m. jemenitica that demonstrated the drastic effect of neonicotinoids on associative learning in indigenous bees. This study further expresses the possible severity of insecticidal exposure to bees in actual field conditions and its effect on the neural functions used in important behavior involved in the foraging of bees.

However, the impact of these insecticides on this bee has not been fully investigated. This study assessed the susceptibility levels of T. angustula to four neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam), widely used to manage pests on different crops, and their effects on locomotion of the bee. Neonicotinoids with the cyano radical caused lower bee mortality (assessed by mean lethal concentration, LC50), while those compounds with the nitro radical were highly harmful to T. angustula. Locomotion activity was strongly impaired in bees treated with thiacloprid and imidacloprid, while acetamiprid did not affect the locomotion activity, which was similar to the control. Application of thiamethoxam caused hyperactivity, as observed by increases of similar to 4.5 and 5.0-fold in mean speed and distance traveled, respectively. These results suggest that applications of neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the pollination activity of T. angustula. These results can also help to develop strategies to conserve these pollinators in agroecosystems. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Pesticide exposure affects flight dynamics and reduces flight endurance in bumblebees	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The emergence of agricultural land use change creates a number of challenges that insect pollinators, such as eusocial bees, must overcome. Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator-the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first 3/4 km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving. Given that bumblebees are central place foragers, impairment to flight endurance could translate to a decline in potential forage area, decreasing the abundance, diversity, and nutritional quality of available food, while potentially diminishing pollination service capabilities.

OIKOS												Populations are formed of their constituent interacting individuals, each with their own respective within-host biological processes. Infection not only spreads within the host organism but also spreads between individuals. Here we propose and study a multilevel model which links the within-host statuses of immunity and parasite density to population epidemiology under sublethal and lethal toxicant exposure. We analyse this nested model in order to better understand how toxicants impact the spread of disease within populations. We demonstrate that outbreak of infection within a population is completely determined by the level of toxicant exposure, and that it is maximised by intermediate toxicant dosage. We classify the population epidemiology into five phases of increasing toxicant exposure and calculate the conditions under which disease will spread, showing that there exists a threshold toxicant level under which epidemics will not occur. In general, higher toxicant load results in either extinction of the population or outbreak of infection. The within-host statuses of the individual host also determine the outcome of the epidemic at the population level. We discuss applications of our model in the context of environmental epidemiology, predicting that increased exposure to toxicants could result in greater risk of epidemics within ecological systems. We predict that reducing sublethal toxicant exposure below our predicted safe threshold could contribute to controlling population level disease and infection.				; Childs, Dylan/P-7388-2018	Iwasa, Yoh/0000-0003-0691-1852; Childs, Dylan/0000-0002-0675-4933; Booton, Ross/0000-0002-3013-4179												0030-1299	1600-0706				MAY	2019	128	5					729	740		10.1111/oik.05654							WOS:000466555000011

Hence honey bees are often exposed to these pesticides. But until now, the effects of theses combinations at field-realistic doses on honey bee health have been poorly investigated. In this study, we explore the synergistic mortality and some physiological effects in surviving honey bees after chronic oral exposure to acetamiprid and/or propiconazole in the laboratory. The results indicated that chronic combined exposure to acetamiprid and propiconazole produced a significant synergistic effect on mortality both for newly emerged bees (50% mortality in 7.2 days) and forager bees (50% mortality in 4.8 days). Honey bee weight of newly emerged bees was decreased after feeding food with a field concentration of acetamiprid and propiconazole, alone or combined for 10 days. Combination of acetamiprid and propiconazole also modulated the activities of P450s, GST and CAT in newly emerged bees and forager bees than either alone, but neither pesticide affected the activity of AChE. These results show that chronic combined exposure to pesticides of relatively low toxicity may caused severely physiological disruptions that could be potentially damaging for the honey bees.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				MAY	2019	28	4					399	411		10.1007/s10646-019-02030-4							WOS:000467546400003	30874992

Chronic contact with realistic soil concentrations of imidacloprid affects the mass, immature development speed, and adult longevity of solitary bees	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The non-target effects of pesticides are an area of growing concern, particularly for ecologically and economically important organisms such as bees. Much of the previous research on the effects of neonicotinoids, a class of insecticide that has gained attention for non-target effects, on bees focused on the consumption of contaminated food resources by a limited number of eusocial species. However, neonicotinoids are known to accumulate and persist in soils at concentrations 2 to 60 times greater than in food resources, and may represent an important route of exposure for diverse and ecologically important ground-nesting bees. This study aimed to assess the effect of chronic contact exposure to realistic soil concentrations of imidacloprid, the most widely used neonicotinoid pesticide, on bee longevity, development speed, and body mass. Cohorts of Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata were used as proxies for ground-nesting species. We observed species- and sex-specific changes to adult longevity, development speed, and mass in response to increasing concentrations of imidacloprid. These results suggest that chronic exposure to nesting substrates contaminated with neonicotinoids may represent an important route of exposure that could have considerable physiological and ecological consequences for bees and plant-pollinator interactions.

J	Cook, SC				Cook, Steven C.			Compound and Dose-Dependent Effects of Two Neonicotinoid Pesticides on Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) Metabolic Physiology	INSECTS												Use of neonicotinoid pesticides is now ubiquitous, and consequently non-targeted arthropods are exposed to their residues at sub-lethal doses. Exposure to these neurotoxins may be a major contributor to poor honey bee colony health. Few studies have explored how sub lethal exposure to neonicotinoids affects honey bee metabolic physiology, including nutritional and energetic homeostasis, both of which are important for maintaining colony health. Reported here are results from a study of chronic oral exposure of honey bees to two sub lethal concentrations of clothianidin and imidacloprid. Neonicotinoids altered important aspects of honey bee nutritional and metabolic physiology in a compound and dose-dependent manner; both compounds at low doses reduced honey bee body weight. Low-dose clothianidin exposure resulted in bees having protein, lipids, carbohydrates, and glycogen levels similar to newly emerged bees. High-dose clothianidin exposure lowered lipids and glycogen content of bees. High-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees having depressed metabolic rate. Low-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees consuming low and high levels of protein and carbohydrate rich foods, respectively. Results suggest neonicotinoids interfere with honey bee endocrine neurophysiological pathways. Compound and dose-dependent effects might represent respective chemical structural differences determining an observed effect, and thresholds of compound effects on honey bee physiology.					cook, steven/0000-0003-4927-1402													2075-4450				JAN	2019	10	1							18	10.3390/insects10010018							WOS:000457198700025	30626039

However, environmental neurotoxic insecticides as neonicotinoids may affect the social performance of the bees. Here, we evaluated the sublethal effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid on the larval food of queens from Plebeia droryana, a species of neotropical stingless bee. Several behaviors were analyzed as multivariate response variables in a Hotelling test, as well as generalized additive mixed models. Our findings demonstrate that treated queens perform less wing vibration and trophallaxis with their workers. Furthermore, the treated gynes encounter more harassment (aggression) from their workers, suggesting that workers can differentiate nontreated queens from treated queens most likely by chemical signals. Our data indicate that the behavioral repertoire underlying the queen selection process by the stingless bee P. droryana may be seriously affected by residual doses of imidacloprid in larval food. As a result, such queens are rather undernourished and aggressed by workers, which most likely compromises the viability and permanence of colonies in the long term.				/B-9412-2014; Santos, Charles/AAD-2347-2020	/0000-0001-8452-1716; Santos, Charles/0000-0001-5181-2461; Otesbelgue, Alex/0000-0002-8832-1241												0147-6513	1090-2414				DEC 30	2018	166						42	47		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.09.048							WOS:000448760800006	30245292

Relationship of Landscape Type on Neonicotinoid Insecticide Exposure Risks to Honey Bee Colonies: A Statewide Survey	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Neonicotinoid insecticide use has been suggested as a cause of honey bee colony decline; however, detection rates and concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticide residues in field-collected honey bees have been low. We collected honey bee and beebread samples from apiaries in agricultural, developed, and undeveloped areas during 2 years in Virginia to assess whether landscape type or county pesticide use was predictive of honey bee colony exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides. Trace concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid were detected in honey bees (3 of 84 samples, 2.02-3.97 ng/g), whereas higher concentrations were detected in beebread (5 of 84 samples, 4.68-11.5 ng/g) and pollen (three of five pollen trap samples, 7.86-12.6 ng/g). Imidacloprid was only detected in samples collected during July and August and was not detected in honey bees from hives where neonicotinoids were detected in pollen or beebread. The number of hives sampled at a site, county pesticide use, and landscape characteristics were not predictive of neonicotinoid detections in honey bees or beebread (all P > 0.05). Field surveys may underestimate honey bee exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticides or the risk of exposure in different landscapes because of low detection rates. Undetectably low levels of exposure or high levels of exposure that go undetected raise questions with regard to potential threats to honey bees and other pollinators.

Despite their close chemical structures, significant differences are emphasized by QM (DFT), docking, molecular dynamics, and QM/QM ' calculations. Thus, for the first time, their propensity to interact through chalcogen-bond interactions is highlighted. The influence of the surroundings on this behavior is pointed out: in CLO, an intramolecular S center dot center dot center dot N chalcogen bond is shown to stabilize the structure in the solid state whereas the interaction leads to the preferred conformations in the isolated and continuum solvent models for both compounds. Interestingly, this interaction potential appears to be used for their binding to Ac-AChBP through intermolecular S center dot center dot center dot O chalcogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr195. The use of a suitable level of theory to describe properly these interactions is underlined, the classical methods being unsuited to highlight these interactions. The contribution of halogen bonding through the chlorine atom of the chlorothiazole ring in the binding of the two compounds is also underlined, both in the solid state and in the Ac-AChBP surroundings. However, the accommodation of the two insecticides in the binding site leads to the fact that a halogen-bond contribution is pointed out only for CLO.

J	Sappington, JD				Sappington, James D.			Imidacloprid alters ant sociobehavioral traits at environmentally relevant concentrations	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Much research has focused on the effects of neonicotinoids on honey bees, however, relatively few studies have investigated their effects on ants, a taxonomically-related eusocial insect of high ecological importance. This study quantified how dietary exposures to environmentally-relevant levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (imidacloprid) affected foraging and nest building of the western harvester ant over 14 days. Using a replicated design, statistically-significant reductions in ant foraging success (50% or greater) occurred at concentrations as low as 50ppb compared to controls. Both the number of ants entering the maze and the percentage of foraging ants able to locate food were impacted by imidacloprid exposure. Ants exposed to 50ppb also took three times longer than controls to find food in a test maze. This concentration is among the lowest levels of imidacloprid reported to affect ants and is well within the range of concentrations found in pollen and nectar of imidacloprid-treated plants. Ant foraging success was also impaired at comparable levels as those reported for the honey bee. Although more refinement and research are needed, results from this study suggest that the western harvester ant may be useful for screening the effects of neurotoxic chemicals on their navigation and foraging, two behaviors which are critical to maintaining colony health of ants and the ecological services they provide.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				NOV	2018	27	9					1179	1187		10.1007/s10646-018-1976-7							WOS:000448152800001	30187359

We reviewed studies that were published in the scientific literature since a previous review of the topic. We identified several studies that reported residue levels of pesticides in guttation water. However, few studies addressed guttation water as a potential exposure route to honey bees. In these studies, no significant effects on honey bee colony health or overwintering survival were observed when colonies were located within fields of treated crops during guttation periods. The previous and current review suggests that exposure to pesticides via guttation water alone is unlikely to negatively affect honey bee colonies. A better understanding of water foraging by honey bees would be needed to address whether guttation water could represent a relevant exposure route of honey bees to systemic pesticides.

RETRACTED: Insecticide exposure affects DNA and antioxidant enzymes activity in honey bee species Apis florea and A. dorsata: Evidence from Punjab, Pakistan (Retracted article. See vol. 717, 2020)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Insecticide exposure can affect honey bees in agro-ecosystems, posing behavioral stresses that can lead to population decline. In this study, insecticide incidence, DNA damage, and antioxidant enzyme activity were studied in Apis florea and A. dorsata honey bee samples collected from insecticide-treated and insecticide-free areas of Punjab, Pakistan. Seven insecticides: chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, imidacloprid, phorate, emamectin, chlorfenapyr, and acetamiprid were detected in seven samples of A. florea and five samples of A. dorsata. In total, 12 samples (22.2%) of honey bees were found positive to insecticide presence out of 54 samples. The most frequently detected insecticide was chlorpyrifos, which was found in four samples (7.4%), with a concentration ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 mu g/g and an average concentration 0.03 mu g/g. The comet assay or single cell gel electrophoresis assay, a simple way to measure DNA strand breaks in eukaryotic cells, was used to microscopically find damage of DNA at the level of a single cell. Comet tail lengths of DNA in A. florea and A. dorsata samples from insecticide-treated areas were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than samples from insecticide-free areas. The highest comet tail length (19.28 +/- 2.67 mu m) was observed in DNA of A. dorsata from insecticide-treated areas, while the minimum one (3.18 +/- 1.46 mu m) was noted in A. dorsata from insecticide-free areas. Catalase (CAT) activity did not vary significantly between honey bee samples from insecticide-treated and insecticide-free areas, while glutathione Stransferase (GST) activity showed a significant reduction in response to insecticide exposure. Significant positive correlations were detected between enzyme activity and insecticide concentration in honey bee species from insecticide-treated areas compared with control groups. Toxicity from pesticide exposure at sub-lethal levels after application or from exposure to pesticide residues should not be underestimated in honey bees, as it may induce physiological impairment that can decline honey bees' health.

Even at low concentrations, the effects of these mixtures on bee populations are difficult to predict due to potential synergistic interactions. In this paper, we orally exposed newly emerged females of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis to environmentally realistic levels of clothianidin (neonicotinoid insecticide) and propiconazole (fungicide), singly and in combination. The amount of feeding solution consumed was highest in bees exposed to the neonicotinoid, and lowest in bees exposed to the pesticide mixture. Ovary maturation and longevity of bees of the neonicotinoid and the fungicide treatments did not differ fromthose of control bees. By contrast, bees exposed to the pesticide mixture showed slow ovary maturation and decreased longevity. We found a synergistic interaction between the neonicotinoid and the fungicide on survival probability. We also found an interaction between treatment and emergence time (an indicator of physiological condition) on longevity. Longevity was negatively correlated to physiological condition only in the fungicide and the mixture treatments. Delayed ovary maturation and premature death imply a shortened nesting period (highly correlated to fecundity in Osmia). Our findings provide a mechanism to explain the observed dynamics of solitary bee populations exposed to multiple chemical residues in agricultural environments.

Foraging bumblebees acquire a preference for neonicotinoid-treated food with prolonged exposure	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Social bees represent an important group of pollinating insects that can be exposed to potentially harmful pesticides when foraging on treated or contaminated flowering plants. To investigate if such exposure is detrimental to bees, many studies have exclusively fed individuals with pesticide-spiked food, informing us about the hazard but not necessarily the risk of exposure. While such studies are important to establish the physiological and behavioural effects on individuals, they do not consider the possibility that the risk of exposure may change over time. For example, many pesticide assays exclude potential behavioural adaptations to novel toxins, such as rejection of harmful compounds by choosing to feed on an uncontaminated food source, thus behaviourally lowering the risk of exposure. In this paper, we conducted an experiment over 10 days in which bumblebees could forage on an array of sucrose feeders containing 0, 2 and 11 parts per billion of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam. This more closely mimics pesticide exposure in the wild by allowing foraging bees to (i) experience a field realistic range of pesticide concentrations across a chronic exposure period, (ii) have repeated interactions with the pesticide in their environment, and (iii) retain the social cues associated with foraging by using whole colonies. We found that the proportion of visits to pesticide-laced feeders increased over time, resulting in greater consumption of pesticide-laced sucrose relative to untreated sucrose. After changing the spatial position of each feeder, foragers continued to preferentially visit the pesticide-laced feeders which indicates that workers can detect thiamethoxam and alter their behaviour to continue feeding on it. The increasing preference for consuming the neonicotinoid-treated food therefore increases the risk of exposure for the colony during prolonged pesticide exposure. Our results highlight the need to incorporate attractiveness of pesticides to foraging bees (and potentially other insect pollinators) in addition to simply considering the proportion of pesticide-contaminated floral resources within the foraging landscape.

Since landscape is highly diverse throughout Austria regarding the availability of nutritional resources, we used data from annual surveys on honey bee colony losses ranging over six years to analyse a possible relationship with land use. The data set comprises reports from a total of 6,655 beekeepers and 129,428 wintered honey bee colonies. Regions surrounding the beekeeping operations were assigned to one of six clusters according to their composition of land use categories by use of a hierarchical cluster analysis, allowing a rough distinction between urban regions, regions predominated by semi-natural areas and pastures, and mainly agricultural environments. We ran a Generalised Linear Mixed Model and found winter colony mortality significantly affected by operation size, year, and cluster membership, but also by the interaction of year and cluster membership. Honey bee colonies in regions composed predominantly of semi-natural areas, coniferous forests and pastures had the lowest loss probability in four out of six years, and loss probabilities within these regions were significantly lower in five out of six years compared to those within regions composed predominantly of artificial surfaces, broad-leaved and coniferous forest.																	2045-2322					AUG 16	2018	8								12263	10.1038/s41598-018-30891-y							WOS:000441775900027	30116056

Low dose of neonicotinoid insecticide reduces foraging motivation of bumblebees	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, is often associated with diminishing populations of bees; this loss of pollinators presents a concern for food security and may cause unpredictable changes in ecological networks. However, little is known about the potential behavioural mechanisms behind the neonicotinoid-associated pollinator decline. We quantified the effects of low-dose (1 ppb) imidacloprid exposure on the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Individual bumblebees were released into a flight arena containing three patches of robotic flowers whose colour (yellow, orange, blue) indicated whether the flower delivered a reward (sugar solution). Exposure to imidacloprid had no significant effect on measures of bumblebee physical performance (such as flight speed) or learning (identifying rewarding flowers). However, pesticide-treated bumblebees had reduced foraging motivation compared with the control bumblebees, as they visited fewer robotic flowers, were slower to start foraging and did not visit all three flower colours as often. Neonicotinoid concentrations of 1 ppb, often reported in plant nectar near agricultural lands, can thus affect the foraging behaviour of bumblebees Even without a notable impact on flight performance and learning, a reduction in foraging motivation could explain the poor performance of colonies of bumblebees exposed to neonicotinoids.

J	dos Santos, CF; Otesbelgue, A; Blochtein, B				dos Santos, Charles Fernando; Otesbelgue, Alex; Blochtein, Betina			The dilemma of agricultural pollination in Brazil: Beekeeping growth and insecticide use	PLOS ONE												Pollination by bees improves agricultural crop yields and improves the financial outlook of beekeepers because it increases honey production and hive rental revenues. However, in Brazil, with a few exceptions, these benefits have been neglected in recent years because beekeepers are more interested in honey production than in agricultural pollination. The excessive and indiscriminate use of insecticides on agricultural fields in Brazil appears to be one of the principal obstacles preventing partnership between farmers and beekeepers. The goal of this study was therefore to evaluate the most recent situation in Brazil in relation to the use of insecticides, agriculture and to honey production in comparison with other countries. Our results show that Brazil is the largest consumer of insecticides in the world and that consumption has increased by > 150% over 15 years. While countries with a high Human Development Index (i.e., a measure that can also be used to question national policy choices) are reducing their levels of insecticide use in agriculture, Brazil is going in the opposite direction. It is highly likely the increase seen in other countries is a result of alternative methods for pest control rather than a result of the amount of area under agricultural cultivation and their capability to shift their economies from agriculture to other sectors. The number of hives (23%) and the volume of honey production (72%) in Brazil have, however, increased over the same period, raising Brazil to the ninth highest honey producer in the world. Although the data on apiculture are promising, the growth in use of insecticides in Brazil is a cause for concern because they leave residuals on bee products, on crops, and in the environment. Civil society and government in Brazil should encourage reductions in insecticide use and better relations between agricultural farmers and beekeepers.				/B-9412-2014; Santos, Charles/AAD-2347-2020	/0000-0001-8452-1716; Santos, Charles/0000-0001-5181-2461; Otesbelgue, Alex/0000-0002-8832-1241												1932-6203					JUL 6	2018	13	7							e0200286	10.1371/journal.pone.0200286							WOS:000437809500091	29979763

Valued for their versatility in application, these insecticides may cause deleterious effects in a range of non-target (beneficial) arthropods. However, it remains unclear whether strong patterns exist in terms of their major effects, if broad measures of arthropod performance are negatively affected, or whether different functional groups are equally vulnerable. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 372 observations from 44 field and laboratory studies that describe neonicotinoid effects on 14 arthropod orders across five broad performance measures: abundance, behavior, condition, reproductive success, and survival. Across studies, neonicotinoids negatively affected all performance metrics evaluated; however, magnitude of the effects varied. Arthropod behavior and survival were the most negatively affected and abundance was the least negatively affected. Effects on arthropod functional groups were inconsistent. Pollinator condition, reproductive success, and survival were significantly lower in neonicotinoid treatments compared to untreated controls; whereas, neonicotinoid effects on detritivores were not significant. Although magnitude of arthropod response to neonicotinoids varied among performance measures and functional groups, we documented a consistent negative relationship between exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides in published studies and beneficial arthropod performance.

We here present a new approach for testing sublethal and/or synergistic effects in free flying colonies. In our experiment individually marked honey bees were kept in free flying mini-hives and chronically exposed to sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid clothianidin. Additional groups of bees were challenged with Nosema infections or with combinations of the pesticide and pathogens. Longevity and flight activity of the differentially treated bees were monitored for a period of 18 days. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, no effect of the neonicotinoid treatment on mortality or flight activity could be observed. Although the lifespan of Nosema infected bees were significantly reduced compared to non-infected bees a combination of pesticide and pathogen did not reveal any synergistic effect. Our results indicate that individual bees are less impaired by neonicotinoids if kept within the social environment of the colony. The effect of such a "social buffering" should be considered in future risk assessments.

Viability of honeybee colonies exposed to sunflowers grown from seeds treated with the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam and clothianidin	CHEMOSPHERE												In this study, honeybee colonies were monitored in a field study conducted on sunflowers grown from seeds treated with the systemic neonicotinoids thiamethoxam or clothianidin. This field trial was carried out in different representative growing areas in Spain over a beekeeping season. The health and development of the colonies was assessed by measuring factors that have a significant influence on their strength and overwintering ability. The parameters assessed were: colony strength (adult bees), brood development, amount of pollen and honey stores and presence and status of the queen. The concentration of residues (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) in samples of beebread and in adult bees was at the level of ng.g(-1); in the ranges of 0.10-2.89 ng g(-1) and 0.05-0.12 ng g(-1); 0.10-0.37 ng g(-1) and 0.01-0.05 ng g(-1), respectively. Multivariate models were applied to evaluate the interaction among factors. No significant differences were found between the honeybee colonies of the different treatment groups, either exposed or not to the neonicotinoids. The seasonal development of the colonies was affected by the environmental conditions which, together with the initial strength of the bee colonies and the characteristics of the plots, had a significant effect on the different variables studied.

J	Kopit, AM; Pitts-Singer, TL				Kopit, Andi M.; Pitts-Singer, Theresa L.			Routes of Pesticide Exposure in Solitary, Cavity-Nesting Bees	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Declines of pollinator health and their populations continue to be commercial and ecological concerns. Agricultural practices, such as the use of agrochemicals, are among factors attributed to honey bee (Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) population losses and are also known to have negative effects on populations of managed non-Apis pollinators. Although pesticide registration routinely requires evaluation of impacts on honey bees, studies of this social species may not reveal important pesticide exposure routes where managed, solitary bees are commonly used. Studies of solitary bees offer additional bee models that are practical from the aspect of availability, known rearing protocols, and the ability to assess effects at the individual level without confounding factors associated with colony living. In addition to understanding bees, it is further important to understand how pesticide characteristics determine their environmental whereabouts and persistence. Considering our research expertise in advancing the management of solitary bees for crop pollination, this forum focuses on routes of pesticide exposure experienced by cavity-nesting bees, incorporating the relative importance of environmental contamination due to pesticide chemical behaviors. Exposure routes described are larval ingestion, adult ingestion, contact, and transovarial transmission. Published research reports of effects of several pesticides on solitary bees are reviewed to exemplify each exposure route. We highlight how certain pesticide risks are particularly important under circumstances related to the cavity nesters.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				JUN	2018	47	3					499	510		10.1093/ee/nvy034							WOS:000434922800001

R.; Childs, Dylan Z.; Iwasa, Yoh			Interactions between immunotoxicants and parasite stress: Implications for host health	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Many organisms face a wide variety of biotic and abiotic stressors which reduce individual survival, interacting to further reduce fitness. Here we studied the effects of two such interacting stressors: immunotoxicant exposure and parasite infection. We model the dynamics of a within-host infection and the associated immune response of an individual. We consider both the indirect sub-lethal effects on immunosuppression and the direct effects on health and mortality of individuals exposed to toxicants. We demonstrate that sub-lethal exposure to toxicants can promote infection through the suppression of the immune system. This happens through the depletion of the immune response which causes rapid proliferation in parasite load. We predict that the within-host parasite density is maximised by an intermediate toxicant exposure, rather than continuing to increase with toxicant exposure. In addition, high toxicant exposure can alter cellular regulation and cause the breakdown of normal healthy tissue, from which we infer higher mortality risk of the host. We classify this breakdown into three phases of increasing toxicant stress, and demonstrate the range of conditions under which toxicant exposure causes failure at the within-host level. These phases are determined by the relationship between the immunity status, overall cellular health and the level of toxicant exposure. We discuss the implications of our model in the context of individual bee health. Our model provides an assessment of how pesticide stress and infection interact to cause the breakdown of the within-host dynamics of individual bees. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CROP PROTECTION												The restriction on seed treatments containing neonicotinoid insecticides in the European Union has brought crop protection into focus for oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). In spring sown oilseed rape, neonicotinoid seed treatments have mainly been used for protection against flea beetles (Phyllotreta spp.), and there is now a need to evaluate alternative control methods. We investigated the effect of reduced tillage and altered seeding date on flea beetle crop damage in spring oilseed rape in eight field experiments over three years in south central Sweden. The average proportion of cotyledon area damaged by flea beetles was not affected by the tillage treatment. Proportion of crop damage was, however, lower in early seeded compared to late seeded plots (0.21 compared to 0.28). We conclude that earlier seeding holds promise to be incorporated into an integrated pest management program for flea beetles in spring oilseed rape, whereas further research on reduced or zero tillage strategies for flea beetle control is warranted.

Indirect effects of agricultural pesticide use on parasite prevalence in wild pollinators	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Insect pollinators appear to be experiencing worldwide declines, a phenomenon that has been correlated both with exposure to chemical pesticides and disease prevalence. These factors have been found to have strong and often interacting negative effects on multiple pollinator species in laboratory based studies, however their interactions in the field are less clear. To try and understand the link between pesticide use on pollinator communities, and how this might impact on disease transmission, we took two complementary approaches. First, we undertook a series of pollinator surveys to assess the abundance and diversity of pollinator groups across British agricultural field sites subject to varying levels of pesticide use. We then screened the offspring of two taxa of tube nesting solitary bees (Osmiabicomis and Megachile spp.) for three parasite groups commonly associated with pollinators. We found lower pollinator abundance, group richness and diversity across agricultural sites associated with higher pesticide use. Specifically, there were fewer honey bees, hoverflies, solitary bees and wasps. Surprisingly, we found a lower prevalence of all three parasite groups in O. bicomis offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide use compared to lower pesticide use. We also found a lower prevalence of Ascosphaera but a higher prevalence of Microsporidia in Megachile offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide use compared to lower pesticide use. Together, our results suggest that agricultural sites associated with higher pesticide use may be affecting pollinators indirectly by disrupting community structure and influencing disease epidemiology and vectoring opportunities. This highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between pesticide use and disease in both managed and wild bee populations for the future mitigation of pollinator declines.

J	Basley, K; Goulson, D				Basley, Kate; Goulson, Dave			Effects of Field-Relevant Concentrations of Clothianidin on Larval Development of the Butterfly Polyommatus icarus (Lepidoptera, Lycaenidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Arable field margins are often sown with wildflowers to encourage pollinators and other beneficial or desirable insects such as bees and butterflies. Concern has been raised that these margins may be contaminated with systemic pesticides such as neonicotinoids used on the adjacent crop, and that this may negatively impact beneficial insects. The use of neonicotinoids has been linked to butterfly declines, and species such as the common blue butterfly (Polyommatus icarus) that feed upon legumes commonly sown in arable field margins, may be exposed to such toxins. Here, we demonstrate that the larval food plants of P. icarus growing in an arable field margin adjacent to a wheat crop treated with the neonicotinoid clothianidin not only contain the pesticide at concentrations comparable to and sometimes higher than those found in foliage of treated crops (range 0.2-48 ppb) but also remain detectable at these levels for up to 21 months after sowing of the crop. Overall, our study demonstrates that nontarget herbivorous organisms in arable field margins are likely to be chronically exposed to neonicotinoids. Under laboratory conditions, exposure to clothianidin at 15 ppb (a field-realistic dose) or above reduced larval growth for the first 9 days of the experiment. Although there was evidence of clothianidin inducing mortality in larvae, with highest survival in control groups, the dose response relationship was unclear. Our study suggests that larvae of this butterfly exhibit some deleterious sublethal and sometimes lethal impacts of exposure to clothianidin, but many larvae survive to adulthood even when exposed to high doses.

In solitary bee species the direct link between each individual female and reproductive success offers the opportunity to evaluate effects on individuals. The present study investigated effects of exposure to winter oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seed on reproductive behavior and output of solitary red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) released in 6 pairs of fields over a 2-yr period and confined to tunnels in a single year. After adjustment to the number of females released, there was significantly lower production of cells and cocoons/female in tunnels than in open field conditions. This difference may be because of the lack of alternative forage within the tunnels. Under open field conditions, palynology of the pollen provisions within the nests demonstrated a maximum average of 31% oilseed rape pollen at any site, with Quercus (oak) contributing up to 86% of the pollen. There were no significant effects from exposure to oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seed from nest establishment through cell production to emergence under tunnel or field conditions.

Colonies to Pesticides in Pollen, A Statewide Assessment in Maine	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												In 2015, we conducted a statewide assessment of honey bee exposure to pesticides with assistance of volunteer beekeepers. Pollen trapping was conducted at 32 sites in the spring, summer, and early fall. Apiary locations ranged from unmanaged natural landscapes to managed agricultural or urban landscapes. Pollen samples at each site were aggregated over the collection dates and chemical residue analysis was conducted on each pollen sample for 190 pesticides and metabolites using HPLC/MS. Twenty-five different residues were detected for an average of 2.9 detections per site. Detections were dominated by fungicides, but risk, calculated as: ppb residue concentration/LD50, was mostly due to insecticides. Beekeeper perceived land-use in the vicinity of each apiary was associated with significant differences in the number of detections and residue concentrations, agricultural landscapes greater than nonagricultural. However, there was no significant difference in oral or contact risk quotients due to land-use type. The landscape composition surrounding apiaries, derived with GIS, determined pesticide exposure for honey bees when total detections, log pesticide residue concentration, and log contact risk quotients were used as measures. Partial least squares explained 43.9% of the variance in pesticide exposure due to landscape composition. The best predictors describing pesticide exposure were: area (ha) of blueberry, coniferous forest, and urban/developed land cover types. Maine is the most forested state in the United States (as determined by % land area forested, 93%) and a negative exponential decay was observed between land area in conifer forest and the number of pesticide detections per apiary.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				APR	2018	47	2					378	387		10.1093/ee/nvy023							WOS:000429267500017	29509899

Seasonal Effects and the Impact of In-Hive Pesticide Treatments on Parasite, Pathogens, and Health of Honey Bees	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Honey bee, Apis mellifera (L.; Hymenoptera: Apidae), populations are in decline and their losses pose a serious threat for crop pollination and food production. The specific causes of these losses are believed to be multifactorial. Pesticides, parasites and pathogens, and nutritional deficiencies have been implicated in the losses due to their ability to exert energetic stress on bees. While our understanding of the role of these factors in honey bee colony losses has improved, there is still a lack of knowledge of how they impact the immune system of the honey bee. In this study, honey bee colonies were exposed to Fumagilin-B, Apistan (tau-fluvalinate), and chlorothalonil at field realistic levels. No significant effects of the antibiotic and two pesticides were observed on the levels of varroa mite, Nosema ceranae (Fries; Microsporidia: Nosematidae), black queen cell virus, deformed wing virus, or immunity as measured by phenoloxidase and glucose oxidase activity. Any effects on the parasites, pathogens, and immunity we observed appear to be due mainly to seasonal changes within the honey bee colonies. The results suggest that Fumagilin-B, Apistan, and chlorothalonil do not significantly impact the health of honey bee colonies, based on the factors analyzed and the concentration of chemicals tested.																	0022-0493	1938-291X				APR	2018	111	2					517	527		10.1093/jee/toy026							WOS:000429319200003	29471479

In this study, the effects of exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam on stingless bees Scaptotrigona bipunctata were evaluated. Foragers bees were exposed to the insecticide and subjected to genetic biochemical, histochemical, and morphological analyses after 24, 48, and 72 h of ingestion. Analysis of isoenzyme esterases revealed significant alterations in the relative activity of EST-4, a type II cholinesterase. Evaluation of the S. bipunctata brain revealed changes in the state of chromatin condensation according to the exposure time and concentration of neonicotinoid compared with the control. Morphological changes were observed in the midgut of this species at all concentrations and exposure times, which may interfere with various physiological processes of these insects. We can conclude that, although thiamethoxam at the concentrations evaluated did not cause high mortality, it induced concentration-dependent changes in bees by activating enzymes related with the protection for xenobiotic, internal morphology and probably these changes may lead to alterations in the activity of bees.

While the use of seed coatings can lessen the amount of overspray and drift, the near universal and prophylactic use of neonicotinoid seed coatings on major agricultural crops has led to widespread detections in the environment (pollen, soil, water, honey). Pollinators and aquatic insects appear to be especially susceptible to the effects of neonicotinoids with current research suggesting that chronic sublethal effects are more prevalent than acute toxicity. Meanwhile, evidence of clear and consistent yield benefits from the use of neonicotinoids remains elusive for most crops. Future decisions on neonicotinoid use will benefit from weighing crop yield benefits versus environmental impacts to nontarget organisms and considering whether there are more environmentally benign alternatives.

Uptake and dissipation of neonicotinoid residues in nectar and foliage of systemically treated woody landscape plants	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Systemic neonicotinoid insecticides used in urban arboriculture could pose a risk to bees and other pollinators foraging on treated plants. We measured uptake and dissipation of soil-applied imidacloprid and dinotefuran in nectar and leaves of 2 woody plant species, a broadleaf evergreen tree (Ilexxattenuata) and a deciduous shrub (Clethra alnifolia), to assess concentrations to which pollinators and pests might be exposed in landscape settings. Three application timings, autumn (postbloom), spring (prebloom), and summer (early postbloom), were evaluated to see if taking advantage of differences in the neonicotinoids' systemic mobility and persistence might enable pest control while minimizing transference into nectar. Nectar and tissue samples were collected from in-ground plants and analyzed for residues by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) in 2 successive years. Concentrations found in nectar following autumn or spring applications ranged from 166 to 515ng/g for imidacloprid and from 70 to 1235ng/gg for dinotefuran, depending on plant and timing. These residues exceed concentrations shown to adversely affect individual- and colony-level traits of bees. Summer application mitigated concentrations of imidacloprid (8-31ng/g), but not dinotefuran (235-1191ng/g), in nectar. Our data suggest that dinotefuran may be more persistent than is generally believed. Implications for integrated pest and pollinator management in urban landscapes are discussed.

Merr.] production in North America since 2001. Use of resistant cultivars is an effective tactic to protect soybean yield. However, the variability and dynamics of aphid populations could limit the effectiveness of host-resistance gene(s). Gene pyramiding is a promising way to sustain host-plant resistance. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalent aphid biotypes in Michigan and to assess the effectiveness of different combinations of aphid-resistance genes. A total of 11 soybean genotypes with known resistance gene(s) were used as indicator lines. Based on their responses, Biotype 3 was a major component of Michigan aphid populations during 2015-2016. The different performance of Rag-"Jackson" and Rag1-"Dowling" along with the breakdown of resistance in plant introductions (PIs) 567301B and 567324 may be explained by Biotype 3 or an unknown virulent biotype establishing in Michigan. With the assistance of flanking markers, 12 advanced breeding lines carrying different aphid-resistance gene(s) were developed and evaluated for effectiveness in five trials across 2015 to 2017. Lines with rag1c, Rag3d, Rag6, Rag3c + Rag6, rag1b + rag3, rag1c + rag4, rag1c + rag3 + rag4, rag1c + Rag2 + rag3 + rag4, and rag1b + rag1c + rag3 + rag4 demonstrated strong and consistent resistance. Due to the variability of virulent aphid populations, different combinations of Rag genes may perform differently across geographies. However, advanced breeding lines pyramided with three or four Rag genes likely will provide broader and more durable resistance to diverse and dynamic aphid populations.																	1380-3743	1572-9788				MAR	2018	38	3							29	10.1007/s11032-018-0790-5							WOS:000427169700012

In this context, a survey was performed on samples from beehives across French areas during the 2012-2016 growing seasons, primarily taken from symptomatic colonies. A total of 488 honeybees, beebread, and wax were analyzed for the presence of pesticide residues. A total of 13 analytes including neonicotinoids and pyrethroids insecticides together with some of their metabolites and the fungicide boscalid were screened within samples. Methodologies based on efficient modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extractions followed by an LC-MS/MS quantification were implemented for each matrix. Thirty-eight percent of the 125 bee samples, 61% of the 87 wax samples, and 77% of the 276 beebread samples contained at least one of the targeted pesticides. Beebread was the most contaminated matrix with an average of two pesticide detections by positive sample and a maximum of seven compounds for a sample. Neonicotinoids and boscalid were the most often detected pesticides, whatever the matrix. The comparison of neonicotinoid detections in samples collected before and after the partial neonicotinoid ban in France displays a decrease in the frequency of detections for contamination levels lower than 1 ng/g in beebread. For higher levels and other matrices, no tendency can be drawn.

Imidacloprid slows the development of preference for rewarding food sources in bumblebees (Bombus impatiens)	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Bee pollination is economically and ecologically vital and recent declines in bee populations are therefore a concern. One possible cause of bee declines is pesticide use. Bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, have been shown to be less efficient foragers and collect less pollen on foraging trips than unexposed bees. We investigated whether bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) chronically exposed to imidacloprid at field-realistic levels of 2.6 and 10 ppb showed learning deficits that could affect foraging. Bumblebees were tested for their ability to associate flower colour with reward value in a simulated foraging environment. Bumblebees completed 10 foraging trips in which they collected sucrose solution from artificial flowers that varied in sucrose concentration. The reward quality of each artificial flower was predicted by corolla colour. Unexposed bumblebees acquired a preference for feeding on the most rewarding flower colour on the second foraging trip, while bumblebees exposed at 2.6 and 10 ppb did not until their third and fifth trip, respectively. The delay in preference acquisition in exposed bumblebees may be due to reduced flower sampling and shorter foraging trips. These results show that bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid are slow to learn the reward value of flowers and this may explain previously observed foraging inefficiencies associated with pesticide exposure.

J	Wu-Smart, J; Spivak, M				Wu-Smart, Judy; Spivak, Marla			Effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid exposure on bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) queen survival and nest initiation	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects and may systemically translocate to nectar and pollen of plants where foraging bees may become exposed. Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests.

At the same time the potential influences of simultaneously occurring agricultural agents on insect pollinator health remain largely unknown. Due to different farming methods, and the drift of applied agents and manure, pollinators are most probably exposed to insecticides but also bacteria from organic fertilizers at the same time. We orally exposed honeybee workers to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and two strains of the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which can occur in manure from farming animals. Our results show that under laboratory conditions the bees simultaneously exposed to the a bacterium and the pesticide thiacloprid thiacloprid had significant higher survival rates 11 days post exposure than the controls, which surprisingly showed the lowest survival. Bees that were exposed to diet containing thiacloprid showed decreased food intake. General antibacterial activity is increased by the insecticide and the bacteria, resulting in a higher immune response observed in treated individuals compared to control individuals. We thus propose that caloric restriction through behavioural and physiological adaptations may have mediated an improved survival and stress resistance in our tests. However, the decreased food consumption could in long-term also result in possible negative effects at colony level. Our study does not show an additive negative impact of sub-lethal insecticide and bacteria doses, when tested under laboratory conditions. In contrast, we report seemingly beneficial effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to agricultural agents, which might demonstrate a surprising biological capacity for coping with stressors, possibly through hormetic regulation.																	1932-6203					JAN 31	2018	13	1							e0191256	10.1371/journal.pone.0191256							WOS:000423668400041	29385177

Researchers originally thought that neonicotinoids exhibited low mammalian toxicity. However, following their widespread use, it became increasingly evident that neonicotinoids could have various toxic effects on vertebrates and invertebrates. The primary focus of this review is to summarize the research progress associated with oxidative stress as a plausible mechanism for neonicotinoid-induced toxicity as well as neonicotinoid metabolism. This review summarizes the research conducted over the past decade into the production of reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, and oxidative stress as a result of neonicotinoid treatments, along with their correlation with the toxicity and metabolism of neonicotinoids. The metabolism of neonicotinoids and protection of various compounds against neonicotinoid-induced toxicity based on their antioxidative effects is also discussed.

Here, we used original farm survey data to examine the impact of the restrictions on pest management practices in eight regional case studies including maize, oilseed rape and sunflower in seven European Union (EU) countries. RESULTSIn four case studies, farmers switched to using untreated seeds as no alternative seed treatments were available. In three case studies, farmers switched to using unrestricted neonicotinoid- or pyrethroid-treated seeds. In five case studies, farmers increased the use of soil or foliar treatments, with pyrethroids as the principal insecticide class. Other changes in pest management practices ranged from increased sowing density to more frequent scouting for pests. Many farmers perceived that the time, cost and amount of insecticides required to protect crops increased, along with pest pressure. Alternative seed treatments were mostly perceived as being less effective than the restricted seed treatments. CONCLUSIONFarmers generally relied on alternative seed treatments or more soil/foliar treatments in the first growing season after the restrictions took effect. Further study is required to assess the effectiveness and sustainability of these alternatives compared with the restricted insecticides. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The pesticide flupyradifurone impairs olfactory learning in Asian honey bees (&ITApis cerana&IT) exposed as larvae or as adults	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Relatively little attention has focused on how pesticides may affect Asian honey bees, which provide vital crop pollination services and are key native pollinators. We therefore studied the effects of a relatively new pesticide, flupyradifurone (FLU), which has been developed, in part, because it appears safer for honey bees than neonicotinoids. We tested the effects of FLU on Apis cerana olfactory learning in larvae (lower dose of 0.033 mu g/larvae/day over 6 days) and, in a separate experiment, adults (lower dose of 0.066 mu g/adult bee/day) at sublethal, field-realistic doses given over 3 days. A worst-case field-realistic dose is 0.44 mu g/bee/day. Learning was tested in adult bees. The lower larval dose did not increase mortality, but the lower adult dose resulted in 20% mortality. The lower FLU doses decreased average olfactory learning by 74% (larval treatment) and 48% (adult treatment) and reduced average memory by 48% (larval treatment) and 22% (adult treatment) as compared to controls. FLU at higher doses resulted in similar learning impairments. The effects of FLU, a pesticide that is reported to be safer than neonicotinoids for honey bees, thus deserve greater attention.

Effects of Thiamethoxam-Treated Seed on Mexican Bean Beetle (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), Nontarget Arthropods, and Crop Performance in Southwestern Virginia Snap Beans	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Thiamethoxam is a neonicotinoid insecticide commonly applied directly to the seeds ( seed- treatment) of commercial snap beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L. While previous studies have examined target and nontarget effects of thiamethoxam seed- treatments in snap beans and other crops, to our knowledge, none have been conducted in agroecosystems predominated by the pest Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis Mulsant ( Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). This study examined the effects of thiamethoxam- treated snap beans on E. varivestis, other arthropods, and crop performance in southwestern Virginia. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate residual toxicity of treated snap beans to E. varivestis and a key predator, Podisus maculiventris ( Say) ( Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Treated plants were highly toxic to E. varivestis at 13 d, moderately toxic from 16 to 20 d, and minimally toxic at 24 d. P. maculiventris was unaffected by exposure to treated plants or by feeding on E. varivestis that consumed treated plants. Small plot field experiments in 2014 and 2015 showed no significant effects of thiamethoxam seed- treatments on E. varivestis densities, other arthropods, crop injury, or yield. In 2016, planting was delayed by persistent rain, resulting in early E. varivestis colonization. In this year, thiamethoxam- treated plants had significantly lower densities and feeding injury from E. varivestis, followed by significantly higher yields. Natural enemies were unaffected by seed- treatments in all field experiments. These experiments demonstrated that thiamethoxam seed- treatments provide control of E. varivestis when beetles infest fields within 2 to 3 wk after planting; but otherwise provide negligible advantages. Negative effects from thiamethoxam seed- treatments on nontarget arthropods appear minimal for snap beans in this region.																	0046-225X	1938-2936				DEC	2017	46	6					1397	1405		10.1093/ee/nvx152							WOS:000417734400027	29069307

Structural variants in the exons of candidate genes were identified. The soybean aphid, an invasive species, has significantly threatened soybean production in North America since 2000. Host-plant resistance is known as an ideal management strategy for aphids. Two novel aphid-resistance loci, Rag6 and Rag3c, from Glycine soja 85-32, were previously detected in a 10.5-cM interval on chromosome 8 and a 7.5-cM interval on chromosome 16, respectively. Defining the exact genomic position of these two genes is critical for improving the effectiveness of marker-assisted selection for aphid resistance and for identification of the functional genes. To pinpoint the locations of Rag6 and Rag3c, four populations segregating for Rag6 and Rag3c were used to fine map these two genes. The availability of the Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K/8K iSelect BeadChip, combined with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers discovered through the whole-genome re-sequencing of E12901, facilitated the fine mapping process. Rag6 was refined to a 49-kb interval on chromosome 8 with four candidate genes, including three clustered nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes and an amine oxidase encoding gene. Rag3c was refined to a 150-kb interval on chromosome 16 with 11 candidate genes, two of which are a LRR gene and a lipase gene. Moreover, by sequencing the whole-genome exome-capture of the resistant source (E12901), structural variants were identified in the exons of the candidate genes of Rag6 and Rag3c. The closely linked SNP markers and the candidate gene information presented in this study will be significant resources for integrating Rag6 and Rag3c into elite cultivars and for future functional genetics studies.																	0040-5752	1432-2242				DEC	2017	130	12					2601	2615		10.1007/s00122-017-2979-0							WOS:000414503500010	28887657

A common neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam, alters honey bee activity, motor functions, and movement to light	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Honey bees provide key ecosystem services. To pollinate and to sustain the colony, workers must walk, climb, and use phototaxis as they move inside and outside the nest. Phototaxis, orientation to light, is linked to sucrose responsiveness and the transition of work from inside to outside the nest, and is also a key component of division of labour. However, the sublethal effects of pesticides on locomotion and movement to light are relatively poorly understood. Thiamethoxam (TMX) is a common neonicotinoid pesticide that bees can consume in nectar and pollen. We used a vertical arena illuminated from the top to test the effects of acute and chronic sublethal exposures to TMX. Acute consumption (1.34 ng/bee) impaired locomotion, caused hyperactivity (velocity: +109%; time moving: +44%) shortly after exposure (30 min), and impaired motor functions (falls: +83%; time top: -43%; time bottom: +93%; abnormal behaviours: +138%; inability to ascend: +280%) over a longer period (60 min). A 2-day chronic exposure (field-relevant daily intakes of 1.42-3.48 ng/bee/day) impaired bee ability to ascend. TMX increased movement to light after acute and chronic exposure. Thus, TMX could reduce colony health by harming worker locomotion and, potentially, alter division of labour if bees move outside or remain outdoors.

J	Vogt, MAB				Vogt, Melissa Anne Beryl			Toward functional pollinator abundance and diversity: Comparing policy response for neonicotinoid use to demonstrate a need for cautious and well-planned policy	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Functional pollinator abundance and diversity reflects global ecosystem health. Declines imply consequences for ecosystems, food production and human health. While broader objectives away from monoculture conventional agriculture is not addressed smaller scale approaches for land management require analysis to improve pollinator conservation outcomes. Policy response to neonicotinoid use can provide valuable lessons for developing well-informed, cautious and planned policy that encourages pollinator abundance and diversity. Response is inconsistent around the world with harm considered scientifically inconclusive by companies, governments and policy makers, and varied responses reflecting this position. Bans demonstrate how strong precautionary policy can assist pollination conservation despite a multitude of contrasting stakeholder opinions. Approach to implementation of such bans influences longevity and influence on conservation. This article presents findings from analysis of policy response by country to neonicotinoid use and suggests that variation in response be attributed to three non-exclusive areas; translation of research findings influencing how inconclusive research findings could increase motivation for strong precaution, vested interest and approach to implementation. Scholarly articles and research findings clarifying information available to inform policy decisions are summarised through literature review, organised by key theme of article and additionally mentioned themes. Meta-analysis of the scholarly articles provides statistical representation of mention rates indicative of how pollinator research is considering multiple stressors, associated or concurrent as contributing to declines. The policy process for neonicotinoid use is suggested as a space for learning where other conservation approaches, including introducing new species becomes relevant for policy.

Neonicotinoid pesticides can reduce honeybee colony genetic diversity	PLOS ONE												Neonicotinoid insecticides can cause a variety of adverse sub-lethal effects in bees. In social species such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, queens are essential for reproduction and colony functioning. Therefore, any negative effect of these agricultural chemicals on the mating success of queens may have serious consequences for the fitness of the entire colony. Queens were exposed to the common neonicotinoid pesticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin during their developmental stage. After mating, their spermathecae were dissected to count the number of stored spermatozoa. Furthermore, their worker offspring were genotyped with DNA microsatellites to determine the number of matings and the genotypic composition of the colony. Colonies providing the male mating partners were also inferred. Both neonicotinoid and control queens mated with drones originating from the same drone source colonies, and stored similar number of spermatozoa. However, queens reared in colonies exposed to both neonicotinoids experienced fewer matings. This resulted in a reduction of the genetic diversity in their colonies (i.e. higher intracolonial relatedness). As decreased genetic diversity among worker bees is known to negatively affect colony vitality, neonicotinoids may have a cryptic effect on colony health by reducing the mating frequency of queens.

A.			5 Key Challenges and Solutions for Governing Complex Adaptive (Food) Systems	SUSTAINABILITY												There is increasing recognition in academic circles of the importance of adaptive governance for the sustainability of social-ecological systems, but little examination of specific implications for the 34% of land-use where human activities are pervasive but potentially commensurate with functioning ecosystems: agricultural production systems. In this paper, we argue for the need to view food systems and agro-ecosystems as multi-scalar complex adaptive systems and identify five key challenging characteristics of such systems: multi-causality; cumulative impacts; regime shifts; teleconnections and mismatch of scales. These characteristics are necessary features of multi-scalar adaptive systems, and apply equally to social and natural subsystems. We discuss the implications of these characteristics for agricultural production systems and consider how governance can rise to these challenges. We present five case studies that highlight these issues: pollinator declines; payments for ecosystem services; pest control and pesticide resistance; downstream aquatic systems in Tasman Bay, New Zealand; and riparian buffers in Puget Sound, USA. From these case studies we derive recommendations for managing agricultural systems, both specific and general. Ultimately, adaptive governance of agro-ecosystems will likely hinge upon three paradigm shifts: viewing farmers and ranchers not only as food producers but also as land and water managers; seeking not yield maximization but rather resilient management of food ecosystems; and critically, as it transcends the production-system literature, engaging broad audiences not only as consumers but also citizens.

J	Samson-Robert, O; Labrie, G; Chagnon, M; Fournier, V				Samson-Robert, Olivier; Labrie, Genevieve; Chagnon, Madeleine; Fournier, Valerie			Planting of neonicotinoid-coated corn raises honey bee mortality and sets back colony development	PEERJ												Worldwide occurrences of honey bee colony losses have raised concerns about bee health and the sustainability of pollination-dependent crops. While multiple causal factors have been identified, seed coating with insecticides of the neonicotinoid family has been the focus of much discussion and research. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the impacts of these insecticides under field conditions or in commercial beekeeping operations. Given that corn-seed coating constitutes the largest single use of neonicotinoid, our study compared honey bee mortality from commercial apiaries located in two different agricultural settings, i.e. corn-dominated areas and corn-free environments, during the corn planting season. Data was collected in 2012 and 2013 from 26 bee yards. Dead honey bees from five hives in each apiary were counted and collected, and samples were analyzed using a multi-residue LC-MS/ MS method. Long-term effects on colony development were simulated based on a honey bee population dynamic model. Mortality survey showed that colonies located in a corn-dominated area had daily mortality counts 3.51 times those of colonies from corn crop-free sites. Chemical analyses revealed that honey bees were exposed to various agricultural pesticides during the corn planting season, but were primarily subjected to neonicotinoid compounds (54% of analysed samples contained clothianidin, and 31% contained both clothianidin and thiamethoxam). Performance development simulations performed on hive populations' show that increased mortality during the corn planting season sets back colony development and bears contributions to collapse risk but, most of all, reduces the effectiveness and value of colonies for pollination services. Our results also have implications for the numerous large-scale and worldwide-cultivated crops that currently rely on pre-emptive use of neonicotinoid seed treatments.																	2167-8359					AUG 14	2017	5								e3670	10.7717/peerj.3670							WOS:000411942300005	28828265

Bumblebee colony development following chronic exposure to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam under laboratory conditions	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Neonicotinoid pesticides are used in agriculture to reduce damage from crop pests. However, beneficial insects such as bees can come into contact with these pesticides when foraging in treated areas, with potential consequences for bee declines and pollination service delivery. Honeybees are typically used as a model organism to investigate insecticide impacts on bees, but relatively little is known about impacts on other taxa such as bumblebees. In this experiment, we chronically exposed whole mature bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (2.4ppb & 10ppb) over four weeks, and compared colony growth under laboratory conditions. We found no impact of insecticide exposure on colony weight gain, or the number or mass of sexuals produced, although colonies exposed to 2.4ppb produced larger males. As previous studies have reported pesticide effects on bumblebee colony growth, this may suggest that impacts on bumblebee colonies are more pronounced for colonies at an earlier stage in the reproductive cycle. Alternatively, it may also indicate that thiamethoxam differs in toxicity compared to previously tested neonicotinoids in terms of reproductive effects. In either case, assessing bumblebee colony development under field conditions is likely more informative for real world scenarios than tests conducted in laboratory conditions.

Within the context of challenges to crop pollinators and crop production, farm managers require strategies that can reliably provide sufficient pollination to ensure maximum economic return from their pollinator-dependent crops. There are unexploited opportunities to increase yields by managing insect pollination, especially for crops that are dependent on insect pollination for fruit set. We introduce the concept of Integrated Crop Pollination as a unifying theme under which various strategies supporting crop pollination can be developed, coordinated, and delivered to growers and their advisors. We emphasize combining tactics that are appropriate for the crop's dependence on insect-mediated pollination, including the use of wild and managed bee species, and enhancing the farm environment for these insects through directed habitat management and pesticide stewardship. This should be done within the economic constraints of the specific farm situation, and so we highlight the need for flexible strategies that can help growers make economically-based ICP decisions using support tools that consider crop value, yield benefits from adoption of ICP components, and the cost of the practices. Finally, education and technology transfer programs will be essential for helping land managers decide on the most efficient way to apply ICP to their unique situations. Building on experiences in North America and beyond, we aim to provide a broad framework for how crop pollination can help secure future food production and support society's increasing demand for nutritious diets.

Impact of controlled neonicotinoid exposure on bumblebees in a realistic field setting	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Pesticide exposure has been implicated as a contributor to insect pollinator declines. In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

The aim of this task was to investigate incidents of overwintered colonies' death with regard to the potential interrelation to the exposure to pesticides. The samples of winter stores of bee bread and sugar food (honey or syrup processed by bees), beeswax and bees collected from apiaries with low and high rates of winter colony mortality were searched for acaricides used to control V. destructor and plant protection pesticides. The presence of acaricides used in apiculture has been detected in the 51% beeswax samples. The most abundant acaricide was tau-fluvalinate. The stores of bee bread and sugar food had a similar frequency of plant protection pesticide occurrence, ranging between 50-60%, but the number of active substances and their concentrations were substantially lower in sugar food samples. The most prevalent pesticides in pollen were fungicides (carbendazim and boscalid) and insecticides (acetamiprid and thiacloprid). Only a few pesticides were found in the several dead honey bees. The level of pesticide contamination (frequency, concentration, toxicity) of hive products and bees originating from apiaries with both a high and low winter colony survival rates, was similar, which created a similar extent of risk. Although the multiple varroacides and pesticides were present in the hive environment we not found unequivocal links between their residues and high winter colony mortality.

In this study, we used feeding methods to simulate in-hive exposures of formulated imidacloprid (Advise (R) 2FL) alone and mixtures with six representative pesticides for different classes. Advise, fed at 4.3 mg/L (equal to maximal residue detection of 912 ppb active ingredient [a.i.] in pollen) induced 36% mortality and 56% feeding suppression after 2-week feeding. Treatments with individual Bracket (acephate), Karate (lambda-cyhalothrin), Vydate (oxamyl), Domark (tetraconazole), and Roundup (glyphosate) at residue level had a mortality range of 1.3-13.3%, statistically similar to that of control (P>0.05). The additive/synergistic toxicity was not detected from binary mixtures of Advise with different classes of pesticides at residue levels. The feeding of the mixture of all seven pesticides increased mortality to 53%, significantly higher than Advise only but still without synergism. Enzymatic data showed that activities of invertase, glutathione S-transferase, and acetylcholinesterase activities in imidacloprid-treated survivors were mostly similar to those found in control. Esterase activity mostly increased, but was significantly suppressed by Bracket (acephate). The immunity-related phenoloxidase activity in imidacloprid-treated survivors tended to be lower, but most treatments were statistically similar to the control. Increase of cytochrome P450 activity was correlated with Advise concentrations and reached significant difference at 56 mg/L (12 ppm a.i.). Our data demonstrated that residue levels of seven pesticide in pollens/hive may not adversely affect honey bees, but long term exclusive ingestion of the maximal residue levels of imidacloprid (912 ppb) and sulfoxaflor (3 ppm a.i.) may induce substantial bee mortality. Rotating with other insecticides is a necessary and practical way to reduce the residue level of any given pesticide.																	1932-6203					JUN 7	2017	12	6							e0178421	10.1371/journal.pone.0178421							WOS:000402880700033	28591204					
J	Czerwinski, MA; Sadd, B				Czerwinski, Mitchell Andrew; Sadd, Ben Michael			Detrimental interactions of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and bumblebee immunity	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Pesticides are well known to have a number of ecological effects. However, it is only now becoming understood that sublethal exposures may have effects on nontarget insects of conservation concern through interactions with immunity, thus increasing detrimental impacts in the presence of pathogens. Pesticides and pathogens are suggested to have played a role in recent declines of several wild bee pollinators. Compromised immunity from exposure to widely used neonicotinoids has been demonstrated in honeybees, but further research on interactions between neonicotinoids and immunity in other important bees is lacking. In this study, adult workers of the bumblebee Bombus impatiens received 6-day pulses of either low (0.7 ppb) or high (7 ppb) field realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid prior to assaying immunity and survival following a nonpathogenic immune challenge. High-dose imidacloprid exposure reduces constitutive levels of phenoloxidase, an enzyme involved in melanization. Hemolymph antimicrobial activity initially increases in all groups following an immune challenge, but while heightened activity is maintained in unexposed and low imidacloprid dose groups, it is not maintained in the high exposure dose bees, even though exposure had ceased 6 days prior. Additionally, imidacloprid exposure followed by an immune challenge significantly decreased survival probability relative to control bees and those only immune challenged or imidacloprid exposed. A temporal lag for immune modulation and combinatorial effects on survival suggest that resource-based trade-offs may, in part, contribute to the detrimental interactions. These interactions could have health consequences for pollinators facing multiple stresses of sublethal neonicotinoid exposure and pathogens.																	2471-5638	2471-5646				JUN 1	2017	327	5			SI		273	283		10.1002/jez.2087							WOS:000412084100007	29356442

BULLETIN OF INSECTOLOGY												In the early 2000s, Italian beekeepers began to report bee mortality events linked to maize sowing. Evidence pointed to three neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam) and a phenylpyrazole (fipronil) used for seed dressing that were dispersed in the environment during sowing. Following these events and based on the precautionary principle, in September 2008, the Italian Ministry of Health suspended these four active ingredients as maize seed dressing. Here we show that in Italy after the precautionary suspension, the number of bee mortality events linked to maize sowing drastically declined. At the same time, the average annual maize production per hectare remained unchanged. This finding is indicative of the possibility to maintain stable maize productions without affecting honey bee health status. The implementation of Integrated Pest Management for maize production is discussed.

Agrochemical Mixtures Detected on Wildflowers near Cattle Feed Yards	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												A variety of veterinary pharmaceuticals and pesticides are used on beef cattle feed yards to enhance growth and health of cattle and to control unwanted pests and parasites. Because growth promoters and antibiotics have recently been detected on particulate matter emanating from feed yards, we examined wildflowers collected near feed yards in the Southern Great Plains for the occurrence of antibiotics, beta-agonists, other feed yard-related agrochemicals, and neonicotinoids used on regionally grown row crops. Wildflowers contained detectable concentrations of moxidectin, abamectin, monensin, ractopamine, and neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin). All wildflower samples contained at least one target analyte, while the majority (82%) contained multiple pharmaceuticals and/or pesticides, including 12% of wildflowers containing moxidectin, monensin, ractopamine, and a neonicotinoid. This preliminary survey demonstrates the potential for insect pollinators occurring near feed yards to become exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals derived from beef cattle feed yards and pesticides from row crop-based agriculture.

While exact causes of colony losses remain elusive, risk factors thought to play key roles are ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and neonicotinoid pesticides. The present study aims to investigate effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide Imidacloprid and Varroa mites individually on survivorship, growth, physiology, virus dynamics and immunity of honey bee workers. Our study provides clear evidence that the exposure to sublethal doses of Imidacloprid could exert a significantly negative effect on health and survival of honey bees. We observed a significant reduction in the titer of vitellogenin (Vg), an egg yolk precursor that regulates the honey bees development and behavior and often are linked to energy homeostasis, in bees exposed to Imidacloprid. This result indicates that sublethal exposure to neonicotinoid could lead to increased energy usage in honey bees as detoxification is a energy-consuming metabolic process and suggests that Vg could be a useful biomarker for measuring levels of energy stress and sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees. Measurement of the quantitative effects of different levels of Varroa mite infestation on the replication dynamic of Deformed wing virus (DWV), an RNA virus associated with Varroa infestation, and expression level of immune genes yields unique insights into how honey bees respond to stressors under laboratory conditions.																	1672-9609	1744-7917				JUN	2017	24	3					467	477		10.1111/1744-7917.12335							WOS:000402131100011	26990560

Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about their impact under field conditions. Most studies have been conducted on Apis mellifera and tested single compounds. However, in agricultural environments, bees are often exposed to multiple pesticides. We explore the synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid (clothianidin) and an ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide (propiconazole) in three bee species (A. mellifera, Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis) following oral exposure in the laboratory. RESULTSWe developed a new approach based on the binomial proportion test to analyse synergistic interactions. We estimated uptake of clothianidin per foraging bout in honey bees foraging on seed-coated rapeseed fields. We found significant synergistic mortality in all three bee species exposed to non-lethal doses of propiconazole and their respective LD10 of clothianidin. Significant synergism was only found at the first assessment times in A. mellifera (4 and 24h) and B. terrestris (4h), but persisted throughout the experiment (96h) in O. bicornis. O. bicornis was also the most sensitive species to clothianidin. CONCLUSIONOur results underscore the importance to test pesticide combinations likely to occur in agricultural environments, and to include several bee species in environmental risk assessment schemes.

Neonicotinoids override a parasite exposure impact onhibernation success of a key bumblebee pollinator	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators.

J	Benuszak, J; Laurent, M; Chauzat, MP				Benuszak, Johanna; Laurent, Marion; Chauzat, Marie-Pierre			The exposure of honey bees (Apis mellifera; Hymenoptera: Apidae) to pesticides: Room for improvement in research	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Losses of honey bees have been repeatedly reported from many places worldwide. The widespread use of synthetic pesticides has led to concerns regarding their environmental fate and their effects on pollinators. Based on a standardised review, we report the use of a wide variety of honey bee matrices and sampling methods in the scientific papers studying pesticide exposure. Matrices such as beeswax and beebread were very little analysed despite their capacities for long-term pesticide storage. Moreover, bioavailability and transfer between in-hive matrices were poorly understood and explored. Many pesticides were studied but interactions between molecules or with other stressors were lacking. Sampling methods, targeted matrices and units of measure should have been, to some extent, standardised between publications to ease comparison and cross checking. Data on honey bee exposure to pesticides would have also benefit from the use of commercial formulations in experiments instead of active ingredients, with a special assessment of co-formulants (quantitative exposure and effects). Finally, the air matrix within the colony must be explored in order to complete current knowledge on honey bee pesticide exposure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bumble bee populations have been decreasing in recent decades, with demise of flower resources and pesticide exposure being two of several suggested pressures causing declines. Many empirical investigations have been performed on bumble bees and their natural history is well documented, but the understanding of their population dynamics over time, causes for observed declines, and potential benefits of management actions is poor. To provide a tool for projecting and testing sensitivity of growth of populations under contrasting and combined pressures, we propose a delay differential equation model that describes multi-colony bumble bee population dynamics. We explain the usefulness of delay equations as a natural modeling formulation, particularly for bumble bee modeling. We then introduce a particular numerical method that approximates the solution of the delay model. Next, we provide simulations of seasonal population dynamics in the absence of pressures. We conclude by describing ways in which resource limitation, pesticide exposure and other pressures can be reflected in the model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Arthropod Pest Control for UK Oilseed Rape - Comparing Insecticide Efficacies, Side Effects and Alternatives	PLOS ONE												Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an important combinable break crop in the UK, which is largely protected from arthropod pests by insecticidal chemicals. Despite ongoing debate regarding the use of neonicotinoids, the dominant seed treatment ingredients used for this crop, there is little publicly available data comparing the efficacy of insecticides in controlling key arthropod pests or comparing the impacts on non-target species and the wider environment. To provide an insight into these matters, a UK-wide expert survey targeting agronomists and entomologists was conducted from March to June 2015. Based on the opinions of 90 respondents, an average of 20% yield loss caused by the key arthropod pests was expected to have occurred in the absence of insecticide treatments. Relatively older chemical groups were perceived to have lower efficacy for target pests than newer ones, partly due to the development of insecticide resistance. Without neonicotinoid seed treatments, a lack of good control for cabbage stem flea beetle was perceived. Wide spectrum foliar insecticide sprays were perceived to have significantly greater negative impacts than seed treatments on users' health, natural enemies, pollinators, soil and water, and many foliar active ingredients have had potential risks for non-target arthropod species in UK oilseed rape fields for the past 25 years. Overall, 72% of respondents opposed the neonicotinoid restriction, while 10% supported it. Opposition and support of the restriction were largely based on concerns for pollinators and the wider environment, highlighting the uncertainty over the side effects of neonicotinoid use. More people from the government and research institutes leaned towards neutrality over the issue, compared to those directly involved in growing the crop. Neonicotinoid restriction was expected to result in greater effort and expenditure on pest control and lower production (0-1 t/ha less). Alternatives for future oilseed rape protection were then discussed.

Several classes of natural and synthetic insecticides mediate their effect through interacting at nAChRs. This review examines the basic pharmacology of the neonicotinoids and related chemistry, with an emphasis on sap feeding insects from the order Hemiptera, the principle pest target for such insecticides. Although the receptor subunit stoichiometry for endogenous invertebrate nAChRs is unknown, there is clear evidence for the existence of distinct neonicotinoid binding sites in native insect preparations, which reflects the predicted wide repertoire of nAChRs and differing pharmacology within this insecticide class. The spinosyns are principally used to control chewing pests such as Lepidoptera, whilst nereistoxin analogues are used on pests of rice and vegetables through contact and systemic action, the pharmacology of both these insecticides is unique and different to that of the neonicotinoids.

J	Hurley, T; Mitchell, P				Hurley, Terrance; Mitchell, Paul			Value of neonicotinoid seed treatments to US soybean farmers	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUNDThe benefits of neonicotinoid seed treatment to soybean farmers have received increased scrutiny. Rather than use data from small-plot experiments, this research uses survey data from 500 US farmers to estimate the benefit of neonicotinoid seed treatments to them. As seed treatment users, farmers are familiar with their benefits in the field and have economic incentives to only use them if they provide value. RESULTSOf the surveyed farmers, 51% used insecticide seed treatments, averaging 87% of their soybean area. Farmers indicated that human and environmental safety is an important consideration affecting their pest management decisions and reported aphids as the most managed and important soybean pest. Asking farmers who used seed treatments to state how much value they provided gives an estimate of $US 28.04 ha(-1) treated in 2013, net of seed treatment costs. Farmer-reported average yields provided an estimated average yield gain of 128.0 kg ha(-1) treated in 2013, or about $US 42.20 ha(-1) treated, net of seed treatment costs. CONCLUSIONThese estimates using different data and methods are consistent and suggest the value of insecticide seed treatments to the US soybean farmers who used them in 2013 was around $US 28-42 ha(-1) treated, net of seed treatment costs.

Sepsis and Hemocyte Loss in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera) Infected with Serratia marcescens Strain Sicaria	PLOS ONE												Global loss of honey bee colonies is threatening the human food supply. Diverse pathogens reduce honey bee hardiness needed to sustain colonies, especially in winter. We isolated a free-living Gram negative bacillus from hemolymph of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera) found separated from winter clusters. In some hives, greater than 90% of the dying bees detached from the winter cluster were found to contain this bacterium in their hemolymph. Throughout the year, the same organism was rarely found in bees engaged in normal hive activities, but was detected in about half of Varroa destructor mites obtained from colonies that housed the septic bees. Flow cytometry of hemolymph from septic bees showed a significant reduction of plasmatocytes and other types of hemocytes. Interpretation of the l6S rRNA sequence of the bacterium indicated that it belongs to the Serratia genus of Gramnegative Gammaproteobacteria, which has not previously been implicated as a pathogen of adult honey bees. Complete genome sequence analysis of the bacterium supported its classification as a novel strain of Serratia marcescens, which was designated as S. marcescens strain sicaria (Ss1). When compared with other strains of S. marcescens, Ss1 demonstrated several phenotypic and genetic differences, including 65 genes not previously found in other Serratia genomes. Some of the unique genes we identified in Ss1 were related to those from bacterial insect pathogens and commensals. Recovery of this organism extends a complex pathosphere of agents which may contribute to failure of honey bee colonies.																	1932-6203					DEC 21	2016	11	12							e0167752	10.1371/journal.pone.0167752							WOS:000392853100020	28002470					
J	Douglas, MR; Tooker, JF				Douglas, Margaret R.; Tooker, John F.			Meta-analysis reveals that seed-applied neonicotinoids and pyrethroids have similar negative effects on abundance of arthropod natural enemies	PEERJ												Background. Seed-applied neonicotinoids are widely used in agriculture, yet their effects on non-target species remain incompletely understood. One important group of non-target species is arthropod natural enemies (predators and parasitoids), which contribute considerably to suppression of crop pests. We hypothesized that seed applied neonicotinoids reduce natural-enemy abundance, but not as strongly as alternative insecticide options such as soil- and foliar-applied pyrethroids. Furthermore we hypothesized that seed-applied neonicotinoids affect natural enemies through a combination of toxin exposure and prey scarcity. Methods. To test our hypotheses, we compiled datasets comprising observations from randomized field studies in North America and Europe that compared natural-enemy abundance in plots that were planted with seed-applied neonicotinoids to control plots that were either (1) managed without insecticides (20 studies, 56 site-years, 607 observations) or (2) managed with pyrethroid insecticides (eight studies, 15 site-years, 384 observations). Using the effect size Fledge's d as the response variable, we used meta-regression to estimate the overall effect of seed-applied neonicotinoids on natural enemy abundance and to test the influence of potential moderating factors. Results. Seed-applied neonicotinoids reduced the abundance of arthropod natural enemies compared to untreated controls (d = -0.30 +/- 0.10 [95% confidence interval]), and as predicted under toxin exposure this effect was stronger for insect than for non insect taxa (Q(M) = 8.70, df = 1, P = 0.003). Moreover, seed-applied neonicotinoids affected the abundance of arthropod natural enemies similarly to soil- or foliar-applied pyrethroids (d = 0.16 +/- 0.42 or -0.02 +/- 0.12; with or without one outlying study). Effect sizes were surprisingly consistent across both datasets (I-2 = 2.7% for no-insecticide controls; I-2 = 0% for pyrethroid controls), suggesting little moderating influence of crop species, neonicotinoid active ingredients, or methodological choices. Discussion. Our meta-analysis of nearly 1,000 observations from North American and European field studies revealed that seed-applied neonicotinoids reduced the abundance of arthropod natural enemies similarly to broadcast applications of pyrethroid insecticides. These findings suggest that substituting pyrethroids for seed applied neonicotinoids, or vice versa, will have little net affect on natural enemy abundance. Consistent with previous lab work, our results also suggest that seed-applied neonicotinoids are less toxic to spiders and mites, which can contribute substantially to biological control in many agricultural systems. Finally, our ability to interpret the negative effect of neonicotinoids on natural enemies is constrained by difficulty relating natural-enemy abundance to biological control function; this is an important area for future study.																	2167-8359					DEC 7	2016	4								e2776	10.7717/peerj.2776							WOS:000390051000005	27957400

Replication, effect sizes and identifying the biological impacts of pesticides on bees under field conditions	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Honeybees have world-wide importance as crop pollinators. To ensure their persistence in agricultural systems, statistically robust field trials of plant protection products are vital. 2. We consider the implications of regulations from the European Food Safety Authority that require the detection of a 7% effect size change in bee colony sizes under field conditions. 3. Based on a power analysis, we argue that the necessary levels of replication (68 replicates) may pose practical constraints to field testing. 4. Policy implications. Regulatory studies benefit from data sources collated over a range of spatial scales, from laboratory to landscapes. Basing effect size thresholds solely on expert judgement, as has been done, may be inappropriate. Rather, definition through experimental or simulation studies that assess the biological consequences of changes in colony size for bee populations is required. This has implications for regulatory bodies outside the European Union.

Investigating the impacts of field-realistic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide on bumblebee foraging, homing ability and colony growth	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1.The ability to forage and return home is essential to the success of bees as both foragers and pollinators. Pesticide exposure may cause behavioural changes that interfere with these processes, with consequences for colony persistence and delivery of pollination services. 2. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure (5-43 days) to field-realistic levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (2.4 pph thiamethoxam) on foraging ability, horning success and colony size using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in free-flying bumblebee colonies. 3. Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. 4. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts. We measured no impact of pesticide exposure on homing ability for bees released from 2 km, or when data were analysed overall. 5. Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field-realistic neonicotinoid exposure can have impacts on both foraging ability and homing success of bumblebees, with implications for the success of bumblebee colonies in agricultural landscapes and their ability to deliver crucial pollination services. Pesticide risk assessments should include bee species other than honeybees and assess a range of behaviours to elucidate the impact of sublethal effects. This has relevance for reviews of neonicotinoid risk assessment and usage policy world-wide.

Neonicotinoid-contaminated pollinator strips adjacent to cropland reduce honey bee nutritional status	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Worldwide pollinator declines are attributed to a number of factors, including pesticide exposures. Neonicotinoid insecticides specifically have been detected in surface waters, non-target vegetation, and bee products, but the risks posed by environmental exposures are still not well understood. Pollinator strips were tested for clothianidin contamination in plant tissues, and the risks to honey bees assessed. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantified clothianidin in leaf, nectar, honey, and bee bread at organic and seed-treated farms. Total glycogen, lipids, and protein from honey bee workers were quantified. The proportion of plants testing positive for clothianidin were the same between treatments. Leaf tissue and honey had similar concentrations of clothianidin between organic and seed-treated farms. Honey (mean +/- SE: 6.61 +/- 0.88 ppb clothianidin per hive) had seven times greater concentrations than nectar collected by bees (0.94 +/- 0.09 ppb). Bee bread collected from organic sites (25.8 +/- 3.0 ppb) had significantly less clothianidin than those at seed treated locations (41.6 +/- 2.9 ppb). Increasing concentrations of clothianidin in bee bread were correlated with decreased glycogen, lipid, and protein in workers. This study shows that small, isolated areas set aside for conservation do not provide spatial or temporal relief from neonicotinoid exposures in agricultural regions where their use is largely prophylactic.

J	Stanley, DA; Raine, NE				Stanley, Dara A.; Raine, Nigel E.			Chronic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide alters the interactions between bumblebees and wild plants	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Insect pollinators are essential for both the production of a large proportion of world crops and the health of natural ecosystems. As important pollinators, bumblebees must learn to forage on flowers to feed both themselves and provision their colonies. Increased use of pesticides has caused concern over sublethal effects on bees, such as impacts on reproduction or learning ability. However, little is known about how sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide might affect the ability of bees to visit and manipulate flowers. We observed the behaviour of individual bumblebees from colonies chronically exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide (10ppb thiamethoxam) or control solutions foraging for the first time on an array of morphologically complex wildflowers (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens) in an outdoor flight arena. We found that more bees released from pesticide-treated colonies became foragers, and that they visited more L.corniculatus flowers than controls. Interestingly, bees exposed to pesticide collected pollen more often than controls, but control bees learnt to handle flowers efficiently after fewer learning visits than bees exposed to pesticide. There were also different initial floral preferences of our treatment groups; control bees visited a higher proportion of T.repens flowers, and bees exposed to pesticide were more likely to choose L.corniculatus on their first visit. Our results suggest that the foraging behaviour of bumblebees on real flowers can be altered by sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide. This has implications for the foraging success and persistence of bumblebee colonies, but perhaps more importantly for the interactions between wild plants and flower-visiting insects and ability of bees to deliver the crucial pollination services to plants necessary for ecosystem functioning.

The adult beetles feed on the leaves of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.), which can lead to defoliation and even death of young trees. We evaluated the impact of five commercially available products with different active ingredients (imidacloprid, azadirachtin, Beauveria bassiana (Bals.-Criv.) Vuill., kaolin clay, and pyrethrin) and the presence or absence of weed mat cover in reducing adult beetle feeding on sapling cacao in the field. The use of weed mat cover reduced feeding damage compared to the untreated control, as did foliar application of imidacloprid, azadirachtin, and B. bassiana. In the laboratory, field-collected adult beetles were presented cacao leaf samples dipped in one of the five products and compared to a control. Beetles exposed to pyrethrin died rapidly. Among the other treatments, only exposure to imidacloprid significantly reduced survival relative to the control. Beetles fed very little on leaf samples with azadirachtin but their longevity was not significantly reduced. Imidacloprid, azadirachtin, and weed mat application had the most promise for reducing adult Chinese rose beetle feeding damage in young cacao and deserve further investigation for successful management of this significant pest.																	2075-4450					JUN	2016	7	2								10.3390/insects7020028							WOS:000380036200018	27348004

Toxicological Risks of Agrochemical Spray Adjuvants: Organosilicone Surfactants May Not Be Safe	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH												Agrochemical risk assessment that takes into account only pesticide active ingredients without the spray adjuvants commonly used in their application will miss important toxicity outcomes detrimental to non-target species, including humans. Lack of disclosure of adjuvant and formulation ingredients coupled with a lack of adequate analytical methods constrains the assessment of total chemical load on beneficial organisms and the environment. Adjuvants generally enhance the pesticidal efficacy and inadvertently the non-target effects of the active ingredient. Spray adjuvants are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are not registered by the USA EPA, leaving their regulation and monitoring to individual states. Organosilicone surfactants are the most potent adjuvants and super-penetrants available to growers. Based on the data for agrochemical applications to almonds from California Department of Pesticide Regulation, there has been increasing use of adjuvants, particularly organosilicone surfactants, during bloom when two-thirds of USA honey bee colonies are present. Increased tank mixing of these with ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors and other fungicides and with insect growth regulator insecticides may be associated with recent USA honey bee declines. This database archives every application of a spray tank adjuvant with detail that is unprecedented globally. Organosilicone surfactants are good stand alone pesticides, toxic to bees, and are also present in drug and personal care products, particularly shampoos, and thus represent an important component of the chemical landscape to which pollinators and humans are exposed. This mini review is the first to possibly link spray adjuvant use with declining health of honey bee populations.

J	Watson, K; Stallins, JA				Watson, Kelly; Stallins, J. Anthony			Honey Bees and Colony Collapse Disorder: A Pluralistic Reframing	GEOGRAPHY COMPASS												Scientific narratives surrounding colony collapse disorder (CCD) are often played against one another. However, oppositional knowledge politics do not neatly segregate the materiality and causal properties of the ecological phenomena they represent. Thus the challenge with CCD is not just to describe the partisan character of how knowledge about it is socially produced. It is also about how to integrate these politics through their less antagonistic material ecologies. We review three dominant discourses underlying CCD and honey bee decline and present a synthesis that conveys how their socially embedded perceptions about ecological causality are more compatible. We invoke a theoretical framework from complexity theory to demonstrate how multiple kinds of ecological causality, from the identifiable and addressable to the more emergent and unpredictable, can align under conflicting policy positions. We argue that this continuum of ecological explanations is a more conciliatory framework for responding to CCD. It provides an alternative to the antagonistic politics that tend to reify and defend either a restrictive search for a singular cause, a paralyzing documentation of all possible permutations of CCD, or a return to a utopian agrarian past. Relating how ecological knowledge is socially produced can illuminate stakeholder positions and strategies. But it is also constructive to map out how the ecological suppositions underlying them relate and inform one under.				Stallins, J.

Exposure of native bees foraging in an agricultural landscape to current-use pesticides	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The awareness of insects as pollinators and indicators of environmental quality has grown in recent years, partially in response to declines in honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations. While most pesticide research has focused on honey bees, there has been less work on native bee populations. To determine the exposure of native bees to pesticides, bees were collected from an existing research area in northeastern Colorado in both grasslands (20132014) and wheat fields (2014). Traps were deployed bi-monthly during the summer at each land cover type and all bees, regardless of species, were composited as whole samples and analyzed for 136 current-use pesticides and degradates. This reconnaissance approach provides a sampling of all species and represents overall pesticide exposure (internal and external). Nineteen pesticides and degradates were detected in 54 composite samples collected. Compounds detected in >2% of the samples included: insecticides thiamethoxam (46%), bifenthrin (28%), clothianidin (24%), chlorpyrifos (17%), imidacloprid (13%), fipronil desulfinyl (7%; degradate); fungicides azoxystrobin (17%), pyraclostrobin (11%), fluxapyroxad (9%), and propiconazole (9%); herbicides atrazine (19%) andmetolachlor (9%). Concentrations ranged from 1 to 310 ng/g for individual pesticides. Pesticides were detected in samples collected from both grasslands and wheat fields; the location of the sample and the surrounding land cover at the 1000 m radius influenced the pesticides detected but because of a small number of temporally comparable samples, correlations between pesticide concentration and land cover were not significant. The results show native bees collected in an agricultural landscape are exposed to multiple pesticides, these results can direct future research on routes/timing of pesticide exposure and the design of future conservation efforts for pollinators.

A.; Haddaway, Neal R.; Land, Magnus			Evidence for the effects of neonicotinoids used in arable crop production on non-target organisms and concentrations of residues in relevant matrices: a systematic map protocol	ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE												Background: Neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) have been routinely used in arable crop protection since their development in the early 1990s. These insecticides have been subject to the same registration procedures as other groups of pesticides, thus meet the same environmental hazard standards as all crop protection products. However, during the last 10 years the debate regarding their possible detrimental impact on non-target organisms, particularly pollinators, has become increasingly contentious and widely debated. Against this background, legislators and politicians in some countries, have been faced with a need to make decisions on the future registration of some or all of this class of insecticides, based on published evidence that in some areas is incomplete or limited in extent. This has created much concern in agricultural communities that consider that the withdrawal of these insecticides is likely to have significant negative economic, socio-economic and environmental consequences. Methods: The proposed systematic map aims to address the following primary question: What is the available evidence for the effects of neonicotinoids used in arable crop production on non-target organisms and concentrations of residues in relevant matrices? The primary question will be divided into two sub-questions to gather research literature for (1) the effect of NNIs on non-target organisms (2) the occurrence of concentrations of NNIs in matrices of relevance to non-target organisms (i.e. exposure routes). The systematic map will focus on NNIs used in arable crop production: imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, thiacloprid and dinotefuran. Separate inclusion criteria have been developed for each sub-question. Traditional academic and grey literature will be searched for in English language and a searchable databases containing extracted meta-data from relevant included studies will be developed.
