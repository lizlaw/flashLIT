J	Allen, G. R.; Seeman, O. D.; Schmid-Hempel, P.; Buttermore, R. E.								Low parasite loads accompany the invading population of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris in Tasmania								INSECTES SOCIAUX				54	1			56	63		10.1007/s00040-007-0908-y				2007	2007	In its native Europe, the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.) has co-evolved with a large array of parasites whose numbers are negatively linked to the genetic diversity of the colony. In Tasmania B. terrestris was first detected in 1992 and has since spread over much of the state. In order to understand the bee's invasive success and as part of a wider study into the genetic diversity of bumblebees across Tasmania, we screened bees for co-invasions of ectoparasitic and endoparasitic mites, nematodes and micro-organisms, and searched their nests for brood parasites. The only bee parasite detected was the relatively benign acarid mite Kuzinia laevis (Dujardin) whose numbers per bee did not vary according to region. Nests supported no brood parasites, but did contain the pollen-feeding life stages of K. laevis. Upon summer-autumn collected drones and queens, mites were present on over 80% of bees, averaged ca. 350-400 per bee and were more abundant on younger bees. Nest searching spring queens had similar mite numbers to those collected in summer-autumn but mite numbers dropped significantly once spring queens began foraging for pollen. The average number of mites per queen bee was over 30 fold greater than that reported in Europe. Mite incidence and mite numbers were significantly lower on worker bees than drones or queens, being present on just 51% of bees and averaging 38 mites per bee. Our reported incidence of worker bee parasitism by this mite is 5-50 times higher than reported in Europe. That only one parasite species co-invaded Tasmania supports the notion that a small number of queens founded the Tasmanian population. However, it is clearly evident that both the bee in the absence of parasites, and the mite have been extraordinarily successful invaders.																		0020-1812	1420-9098		WOS:000244565300010

Populations of the introduced Bombus terrestris, which invaded NW Patagonia, Argentina, in 2006, harbor the highly pathogenic protozoan Apicystis bombi. We asked whether A. bombi had been co-introduced with B. terrestris, and if so, whether spillover occurred to the two resident bumblebee species in the region: the introduced European Bombus ruderatus and the native Bombus dahlbomii. We searched for A. bombi by means of PCR in samples of B. ruderatus and B. dahlbomii collected before and after the invasion of B. terrestris and in samples of the latter. We found no A. bombi in samples of B. ruderatus and B. dahlbomii collected before B. terrestris invasion, whereas post invasion, A. bombi was present in all 3 species. The identity of the parasite was established by sequencing the 18S region, which was identical for the three bumblebee species and also matched the European sequence, confirming it to be A. bombi. This is the first report of A. bombi in B. ruderatus and B. dahlbomii. Moreover, our results suggest that Patagonia had been free of A. bombi until this parasite was co-introduced with B. terrestris, and spilled over in situ to these two previously resident species. Finally, our findings provide indirect circumstantial evidence of a potential link between the population collapse and geographic retraction of B. dahlbomii and the introduction of this novel parasite.																		1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000315290100004

However, the underlying assumption that offspring fathered by different males vary in their susceptibility to parasites is so far only supported indirectly. Here we tested this crucial assumption using data from a study on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. with queens inseminated with sperm of either one or several males that originated from different sire groups (i.e. groups of brothers). We found that, under field conditions, workers from different sire groups, forming a patriline within a given colony, indeed differ in their susceptibility to the common intestinal parasite, Crithidia bombi , and do so independently of queen mating frequency.																		1461-023X			WOS:000180394400006

Some social insects carry this behaviour to extremes(1). For example, honeybee queens mate with ten to twenty (car even more) males on their nuptial flights(2). The reasons for this behaviour remain unknown, given the obvious costs of time, energy and exposure to predation. Several potential benefits of polyandry have been proposed(1,3,4), but none are well supported yet. Here we test the hypothesis that genetic diversity among a female's offspring may offer some protection from parasitism(5-7). We artificially inseminated queens of a bumble-bee (Bombus terrestris L.) with sperm of either low or high genetic diversity. The resulting colonies were exposed to parasitism under field conditions. High-diversity colonies had fewer parasites and showed greater reproductive success, on average, than did low-diversity colonies. We suggest that female mating frequency may be influenced in part by parasites.																		0028-0836			WOS:000078085000043

The knowledge of how genetic variation is partitioned among populations may have important implications not only in evolutionary biology and ecology, but also in conservation biology. Hence, reliable estimates of population differentiation are crucial to understand the connectivity among populations and represent important tools to develop conservation strategies. The estimation of differentiation is c from Wright's F-ST and/or Slatkin's R-ST, an F-ST-analogue assuming a stepwise mutation model. Both these statistics have their drawbacks. Furthermore, there is no clear consensus over their relative accuracy. In this review, we first discuss the consequences of different temporal and spatial sampling strategies on differentiation estimation. Then, we move to statistical problems directly associated with the estimation of population structuring itself, with particular emphasis on the effects of high mutation rates and mutation patterns of microsatellite loci. Finally, we discuss the biological interpretation of population structuring estimates.																		0962-1083			WOS:000173726200001	11856418

For policy-makers wishing to make evidence-based decisions which will best support pollinator abundance and pollination services, one of the problems faced is how to access the information and evidence they need, and how to combine it to formulate and evaluate candidate policies. This is even more complex when multiple factors provide influence in combination. The pressures affecting the survival and pollination capabilities of honey bees (Apis mellifera), wild bees, and other pollinators are well documented, but incomplete. In order to estimate the potential effectiveness of various candidate policy choices, there is an urgent need to quantify the effect of various combinations of factors on the pollination ecosystem service. Using high-quality experimental evidence is the most robust approach, but key aspects of the system may not be amenable to experimentation or may be prohibitive based on cost, time and effort. In such cases, it is possible to obtain the required evidence by using structured expert elicitation, a method for quantitatively characterizing the state of knowledge about an uncertain quantity. Here we report and discuss the outputs of the novel use of a structured expert elicitation, designed to quantify the probability of good pollinator abundance given a variety of weather, disease, and habitat scenarios.																		0021-8839	2078-6913		WOS:000448429100001

We examined drifting, a behavioural consequence of introducing closely aggregated colonies into greenhouse habitats, to determine possible explanations for observed drifting frequencies. Bee drift is normally associated with increased individual mortality and disease transfer between colonies. In this study, individual bees frequently drifted into and remained within foreign colonies. More drifting bees were found in colonies with higher worker and brood populations and greater pollen stores. Increased intracolony aggressive interactions were not associated with a higher number of drifting bees. Drifting bees had a significantly greater number of mature eggs in their ovaries than did resident worker bees residing in colonies hosting drifters, suggesting that drifting could potentially increase the fitness of individual worker bees and may not be solely a function of disorientation and (or) nectar robbing. Taken together, our results suggest that drifting of workers into foreign colonies within greenhouses may demonstrate a predisposition to social parasitism. This selfish worker reproduction challenges our previous understanding of social insect societies as being cooperative societies.																		0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000227871500002

We examined orientation and drifting behaviour of Bombus occidentalis Greene and Bombus impatiens Cresson, the two major bumblebee pollinators of greenhouse tomatoes in British Columbia. Our objectives were to establish the extent and frequency of bee drift into foreign colonies and to examine the potential of nest entrance patterns and landmarks to reduce drift in commercial greenhouses. On average, 28% of marked bumblebees drifted into foreign hives, making up 0.3%-34.8% of the population in those colonies. Bees drifted towards the top position when hives were vertically stacked. The use of simple black and white patterns and large landmarks did not affect the number of drifting bees, suggesting that disorientation is not a major contributor to drift or to the substantial loss of adult bees from colonies during their first week in a greenhouse. Bees had decreased foraging times when landmarks were present in the greenhouse and showed a marginally but not significantly increased rate of pollen input to colonies. These studies contribute to understanding bumblebee behaviour in a novel environment and determining whether orientation cues are feasible management options to reduce drift and potential bee loss.																		0008-4301			WOS:000220803800006

Parasites can have dramatic effects on the ecology of their hosts. Such strong host-parasite interactions are the result of either parasites with generally high virulence, or generally benign parasites that nevertheless express context-dependent virulence. Theoretically, one indication that an apparently benign parasite nevertheless has a large impact on its host should be the existence of strong genotypic interactions between host and parasite.2. Crithidia bombi (Trypanosomatidae) is a highly prevalent but generally benign gut parasite of the bumble-bee Bombus terrestris. The demonstration of strong genotypic interactions between C. bombi and B. terrestris, however, suggests that context-dependent virulence may have a large impact on the host population. We thus investigated the effects of C. bombi across the entire life cycle of its host, including the stressful times of hibernation and colony-founding. Owing to the high prevalence and rates of transmission of the parasite in field populations, we used a large-scale laboratory experiment.3. Under stressful hibernation, infected queens lost more mass. Infection also significantly reduced colony-founding success, colony size, male production and overall fitness, by up to 40%. These findings show that strong genotypic host-parasite interactions may indeed be a reliable indicator that apparently benign and highly prevalent parasites are nevertheless exerting a dramatic impact on their host populations.																		0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000186432900009

The fungal pathogen Nosema bombi was recently found to be widespread in declining species of North American bumble bees (Bombus), with circumstantial evidence suggesting an exotic introduction from Europe. This interpretation has been hampered by a lack of knowledge of global genetic variation, geographic origin, and changing prevalence patterns of N. bombi in declining North American populations. Thus, the temporal and spatial emergence of N. bombi and its potential role in bumble bee decline remain speculative. We analyze Nosema prevalence and genetic variation in the United States and Europe from 1980, before an alleged introduction in the early 1990s, to 2011, extracting Nosema DNA from Bombus natural history collection specimens from across this time period. Nosema bombi prevalence increased significantly from low detectable frequency in the 1980s to significantly higher frequency in the mid-to late-1990s, corresponding to a period of reported massive infectious outbreak of N. bombi in commercial bumble bee rearing stocks in North America. Despite the increased frequency, we find no conclusive evidence of an exotic N. bombi origin based on genetic analysis of global Nosema populations; the widespread Nosema strain found currently in declining United States bumble bees was present in the United States before commercial colony trade. Notably, the US N. bombi is not detectably different from that found predominantly throughout Western Europe, with both regions characterized by low genetic diversity compared with high levels of diversity found in Asia, where commercial bee breeding activities are low or nonexistent.																		0027-8424			WOS:000374393800050	27044096

Fragmentary observations, however, have suggested population declines in several North American species. Despite rising concern over these observations in the United States, highlighted in a recent National Academy of Sciences report, a national assessment of the geographic scope and possible causal factors of bumble bee decline is lacking. Here, we report results of a 3-y interdisciplinary study of changing distributions, population genetic structure, and levels of pathogen infection in bumble bee populations across the United States. We compare current and historical distributions of eight species, compiling a database of >73,000 museum records for comparison with data from intensive nationwide surveys of >16,000 specimens. We show that the relative abundances of four species have declined by up to 96% and that their surveyed geographic ranges have contracted by 23-87%, some within the last 20 y. We also show that declining populations have significantly higher infection levels of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema bombi and lower genetic diversity compared with co-occurring populations of the stable (nondeclining) species. Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are, thus, realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in North America, although cause and effect remain uncertain.																		0027-8424			WOS:000286097700045	21199943

We quantified the relative value of native and long-established plant species as forage (nectar and pollen) resources for bumblebees by collating visitation data from 14 field sites across Britain. Twentieth Century changes in range and frequency of these forage plants were assessed using data from the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930-1969 to 1987-1999) and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978-1998). Forage plants declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the two survey periods. These changes were of greater magnitude than changes in other native plant species, reflecting serious reductions in quality of foraging habitats for bees as well as a general decline in insect-pollinated plants. Seventy-six percent of forage plants declined in frequency within 1-km squares, including those (e.g. Trifolium pratense) of particular value for threatened bumblebee species. We consider how our findings relate to other recorded changes in the British flora, how they may help to explain declines in bumblebees and how they could contribute to a conservation strategy.

The widespread European species Bombus terrestris occurs on all major Mediterranean, and some Atlantic islands. Bees from different populations differ in a variety of behavioural traits, including floral colour preferences, flower detection, and learning behaviour. We attempted to correlate these behavioural differences with each population's environment, but could not find straightforward adaptive explanations. We also performed reciprocal transplant studies to compare nectar foraging performance of bees from three different populations, but found that non-native bees consistently outcompeted native bees. Thus, we consider genetic drift, exaptation, and pleiotropy as possible alternative explanations to a strictly adaptive explanation for between population behavioural differences in bumblebees.					21st Symposium of the Society-of-Population-Ecology21st Symposium of the Society-of-Population-Ecology	OCT, 2003OCT, 2003	Soc Populat EcolSoc Populat Ecol	Tsukuba, JAPANTsukuba, JAPAN										1438-3896			WOS:000225977900004

Despite their ecological and economic importance as pollinators, North American bumblebees have not been extensively surveyed and their conservation status is largely unknown. In this study, two approaches were used to determine whether bumblebees in that region were in decline spatially and temporally. First, surveys performed in 2004-2006 in southern Ontario were compared to surveys from 1971 to 1973 in the same sites to look at changes in community composition, in one of the most bumblebee diverse areas of eastern North America. Second, the extent of range decline for a focal species (Bombus affinis Cresson) was estimated by surveying 43 sites throughout its known native range in eastern Canada and the United States. Our study documents an impoverishment of the bumblebee community in southern Ontario over the past 35 years. Bombus affinis in particular was found to have declined drastically in abundance not only in southern Ontario but throughout its native range. The loss of any bumblebee species may result in cascading impacts on native fauna and flora and reduce agricultural production. Implications for the conservation of this important group of pollinators are discussed.																		0960-3115			WOS:000256754200006

Bourke, Andrew/E-5271-2011				Habitat and Forage Associations of a Naturally Colonising Insect Pollinator, the Tree Bumblebee Bombus hypnorum								PLOS ONE				9	9					e107568	10.1371/journal.pone.0107568				SEP 26 2014	2014	Bumblebees (Bombus species) are major pollinators of commercial crops and wildflowers but factors affecting their abundance, including causes of recent population declines, remain unclear. Investigating the ecology of species with expanding ranges provides a potentially powerful means of elucidating these factors. Such species may also bring novel pollination services to their new ranges. We therefore investigated landscape-scale habitat use and foraging preferences of the Tree Bumblebee, B. hypnorum, a recent natural colonist that has rapidly expanded its range in the UK over the past decade. Counts of B. hypnorum and six other Bombus species were made in March-June 2012 within a mixed landscape in south-eastern Norfolk, UK. The extent of different landscape elements around each transect was quantified at three scales (250 m, 500 m and 1500 m). We then identified the landscape elements that best predicted the density of B. hypnorum and other Bombus species. At the best fitting scale (250 m), B. hypnorum density was significantly positively associated with extent of both urban and woodland cover and significantly negatively associated with extent of oilseed rape cover. This combination of landscape predictors was unique to B. hypnorum. Urban and woodland cover were associated with B. hypnorum density at three and two, respectively, of the three scales studied. Relative to other Bombus species, B. hypnorum exhibited a significantly higher foraging preference for two flowering trees, Crataegus monogyna and Prunus spinosa, and significantly lower preferences for Brassica napus, Glechoma hederacea and Lamium album. Our study provides novel, quantitative support for an association of B. hypnorum with urban and woodland landscape elements. Range expansion in B. hypnorum appears to depend, on exploitation of widespread habitats underutilised by native Bombus species, suggesting B. hypnorum will readily co-exist with these species. These findings suggest that management could target bumblebee species with distinctive habitat requirements to help maintain pollination services.																		1932-6203			WOS:000342685600022	25259579

Strategies for their conservation require knowledge of their foraging range and nesting density, both of which are poorly understood. Previous studies have mainly focussed on the cosmopolitan bumblebee species Bombus terrestris, and implicitly assume this to be representative of other species. Here we use a landscape-scale microsatellite study to estimate the foraging range and nesting density of two ecologically dissimilar species, B. terrestris and R pascuorum. Workers were sampled along a 10 kin linear transect and 8-9 polymorphic microsatellite markers used to identify putative sisters. We provide the first published estimates of the number of colonies using a circle of radius 50 in in an agricultural landscape: 20.4 for R terrestris and 54.7 for R pascuorum. Estimates of nest density differed significantly between the two species: 13 km(-2) for B. terrestris and 193 km(-2) for B. pascuorum. Foraging ranges also differed substantially, with R pascuorum foraging over distances less than 312 in and R terrestris less than 625 m. Clearly bumblebee species differ greatly in fundamental aspects of their ecology. This has significant implications for the development of conservation strategies for rare bumblebees and isolated plant populations, for the management of bumblebees as pollinators, and for predicting patterns of gene flow from genetically modified plants.																		0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000225266600003

The analysis included eight populations from the European continent, five from Mediterranean islands (six subspecies altogether) and one from Tenerife (initially described as a colour form of B. terrestris but recently considered as a separate species, B. canariensis). Eight of the 10 microsatellite loci displayed high levels of polymorphism in most populations. In B. terrestris populations, the total number of alleles detected per polymorphic locus ranged from 3 to 16, with observed allelic diversify from 3.8 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 1.4 and average calculated heterozygosities from 0.41 +/- 0.09 to 0.65 +/- 0.07. B. canariensis showed a significantly lower average calculated heterozygosity (0.12 +/- 0.08) and observed allelic diversity (1.5 +/- 0.04) as compared to both continental and island populations of B. terrestris. No significant differentiation was found among populations of B. terrestris from the European continent. In contrast, island populations were all significantly and most of them strongly differentiated from continental populations. B. terrestris mitochondrial DNA is characterized by a low nucleotide diversity: 0.18% +/- 0.07%, 0.20% +/- 0.04% and 0.27% +/- 0.04% for the continental populations, the island populations and all populations together, respectively. The only haplotype found in the Tenerife population differs by a single nucleotide substitution from the most common continental haplotype of B. terrestris. This situation, identical to that of Tyrrhenian islands populations and quite different from that of B. lucorum (15 substitutions between terrestris and lucorum mtDNA) casts doubts on the species status of B. canariensis. The large genetic distance between the Tenerife and B. terrestris populations estimated from microsatellite data result, most probably, from a severe bottleneck in the Canary island population. Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data call for the protection of the island populations of B. terrestris against importation of bumble bees of foreign origin which are used as crop pollinators.																		0962-1083			WOS:A1996TZ21500004	9147693

Parasites are known to be an important factor in the some of the population declines of honey bees and bumblebees, but little is known about the parasites afflicting most other pollinators, or the extent of interspecific transmission or vectoring of parasites. Here we carry out a preliminary screening of pollinators (honey bees, five species of bumblebee, three species of wasp, four species of hoverfly and three genera of other bees) in the UK for parasites. We used molecular methods to screen for six honey bee viruses, Ascosphaera fungi, Microsporidia, and Wolbachia intracellular bacteria. We aimed simply to detect the presence of the parasites, encompassing vectoring as well as actual infections. Many pollinators of all types were positive for Ascosphaera fungi, while Microsporidia were rarer, being most frequently found in bumblebees. We also detected that most pollinators were positive for Wolbachia, most probably indicating infection with this intracellular symbiont, and raising the possibility that it may be an important factor in influencing host sex ratios or fitness in a diversity of pollinators. Importantly, we found that about a third of bumblebees (Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris) and a third of wasps (Vespula vulgaris), as well as all honey bees, were positive for deformed wing virus, but that this virus was not present in other pollinators. Deformed wing virus therefore does not appear to be a general parasite of pollinators, but does interact significantly with at least three species of bumblebee and wasp. Further work is needed to establish the identity of some of the parasites, their spatiotemporal variation, and whether they are infecting the various pollinator species or being vectored. However, these results provide a first insight into the diversity, and potential exchange, of parasites in pollinator communities.																		1932-6203			WOS:000301703800022	22347356

Recent studies on British bumblebees proposed alternative theories to explain declines. One study suggested that greater dietary specialization among the rarer bumblebee species makes them more susceptible to decline. A second study disputed this theory and found that declines in British bumblebees were correlated with the size of species' European ranges, leading to the suggestion that climate and habitat specialization may be better indicators of the risk of decline. Here we use a new and independent dataset based on Irish bumblebees to test the generality of these theories. We found that most of the same bumblebee species are declining across the British Isles, but that, within Ireland, a simple food-plant specialization model is inadequate to explain these declines. Furthermore, we found no evidence of a relationship between declines in Irish bumblebees and the size of species' European ranges. However, we demonstrate that the late emerging species have declined in Ireland (and in Britain), and that these species show a statistically significant westward shift to the extremity of their range, probably as a result of changing land use. Irish data support the finding that rare and declining bumblebees are later nesting species, associated with open grassy habitats. We suggest that the widespread replacement of hay with silage in the agricultural landscape, which results in earlier and more frequent mowing and a reduction in late summer wildflowers, has played a major role in bumblebee declines.

Plant-pollinator interactions are crucial for the reproduction of most angiosperms. When faced with perturbations, plant-pollinator networks might be robust mainly due to the presence of highly generalist species. Perturbations can, in turn, affect how pollinators exploit their food sources and therefore their degree of generalization.2. In particular, generalization of pollinators might vary with forager density. At high densities floral resources available in plant communities would be more rapidly depleted than at low densities. According to optimal foraging theory (OFT), this decrease in resources should lead to an increase in diet breadth.3. We investigated the impact of pollinator density on diet breadth of Bombus terrestris. We recorded the individual foraging behaviour of bumblebees from eight colonies. They foraged in presence of either one or several conspecifics on experimental plant communities composed of five plant species. Diet breadth was calculated as the number of plant species visited, as well as by the Levins index. We analyzed the effect of forager density on diet breadth at both the individual and the colony levels.4. We found that forager density affected degree of generalization at individual and colony levels. A more competitive environment increased individual generalization, as predicted by OFT, and decreased the variability in generalization across colonies. Moreover, we found that bumblebee size was positively related to the amplitude of diet breadth change.5. Synthesis. Our study sheds light on an additional level of complexity of plant-pollinator systems, showing that pollinator diet breadth is a flexible trait which results from behavioural adaptation to resource availability. More generally, changes in foraging insects' diet via competition for resources are likely to ensue from anthropogenic ecosystem disturbance and to impact upon the functioning of plant-pollinator networks.																		0022-0477	1365-2745		WOS:000258379800018

In the UK, approximately 15,000 Bombus terrestris nests per year are imported for use in this way. Here we examine pollen loads on commercial bumble bees returning to their nests, stationed next to soft fruit crops at three farms in Scotland, UK, to determine whether pollen-collecting bees are visiting the target crop. Only 12% of pollen was of Rubus type (most likely raspberry) and 15% was of Potentilla type (probably strawberry). The remaining 73% of pollen was from a range of non-target wildflowers, in declining importance: Brassicaceae (22%), Filipendula type (18%), Violaceae (11%), Trifolium type (6%) and Apiaceae (6%). It is unclear how this relates to the pollination service provided, since the bees may make nectar-collecting visits to the fruit crops. Nonetheless a substantial proportion of foraging by commercial bees is clearly not on the target crops. Means for improving the efficiency of fruit pollination, and possible ecological implications of use of wild flowers by commercial bumble bees are discussed.																		0021-8839	2078-6913		WOS:000338935200008

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR				70				209	215		10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.09.025				JUL 2005	2005	Although the capacity to learn how to manipulate flowers plays an integral role in the foraging of bumblebees, little is known about the effects of parasitic infection on the motor learning and memory of host bees. In the laboratory experiment reported here, we examined whether infection by the intestinal protozoan Crithidia bombi affected the ability of bumblebees, Bombus impatiens, to learn the specialized motor pattern required to handle a novel flower type. Using videotaped records of foraging behaviour, we related the motor performance of bees to the intensity of C. bombi infection. Low intensities of infection had no effect on the ability of bees to learn a novel flower-handling method; however, a high intensity of infection significantly reduced both motor-learning rate and maximum handling proficiency. In addition, highly infected bees showed a 200% increase in the amount of time and the number of visits required to learn how to manipulate flowers. These results indicate that C. bombi can influence the foraging behaviour of host bumblebees in subtle but ecologically significant ways. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We also investigated mite infestation in commercial colonies of a Japanese native species, B. ignitus, which are mass-produced in the Netherlands and reimported into Japan. We detected the mite in both natural and commercial colonies of the Japanese species. Comparison of 555 bp sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I (CO1) gene from the mite showed that there were seven haplotypes, on the basis of combinations of substitutions at eight sites in the gene. The haplotypes of the mites in the Japanese native bumblebees and the haplotypes of the mites in B. terrestris did not overlap; however, mtDNA of mites detected in the commercial colonies of B. ignitus possessed the same sequence as a European haplotype.

Many ecologists had warned of biological invasion by this species, and in 1996 a naturalized colony was found in Hokkaido, indicating that the species had become naturalized. The Ministry of the Environment effected a new law, the Invasive Alien Species Act, in 2005 to protect Japanese native fauna and flora from invasive alien species. Heated arguments arose between conservation ecologists and agriculturalists about whether the law should regulate B. terrestris. To reach a scientific decision, we began a study to reveal the ecological impacts of B. terrestris and to develop methods to control its naturalization. On the basis of our results, the Ministry of the Environment classified B. terrestris as invasive and requiring regulation by law, but its use would be permitted on the condition that it be used only for agriculture and that measures to prevent escape be taken. This legal control of B. terrestris in Japan is a revolutionary trial that aims to achieve a state of mutualism between biodiversity and agriculture.																		0003-6862	1347-605X		WOS:000276579400001

We also investigated mite infestation in commercial colonies of the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, imported from the Netherlands and Belgium, and the Japanese native species, B. ignitus, imported from the Netherlands, between 1997 and 2001. We detected mites in natural populations of the two B. hypocrita subspecies and in the commercial colonies. Analysis of variations in 535 bp sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene showed that the mite haplotypes in the native populations and in the imported colonies did not overlap in 1997-1999, but in 2000-2001 some mites possessing European CO1 haplotypes were detected in the natural populations of Japanese native bumblebees. In addition, many mites possessing Japanese haplotypes were detected in the imported commercial colonies from Europe. Considering the fact that the Japanese native bumblebees, B. hypocrita, were once exported to Europe for commercialization, these results suggest that bumblebee commercialization has caused overseas migration and cross-infestation of parasitic mites among natural and commercial colonies. However, because the Japanese and European CO1 haplotypes were closely related, there was a possibility that the European haplotypes found in the mites in the Hokkaido Island revealed native variation. To clarify the status of mite invasion, further detailed analysis of genetic variation of the mite, using other genetic markers on additional samples, need to be performed.					22nd Symposium of the Society-of-Population-Ecology22nd Symposium of the Society-of-Population-Ecology	OCT 28-30, 2005OCT 28-30, 2005	Soc Populat EcolSoc Populat Ecol	Ishikawa, JAPANIshikawa, JAPAN										1438-3896			WOS:000241451500005

Impacts of habitat degradation and fragmentation are likely to be compounded by the social nature of humble bees and their largely monogamous breeding system, which renders their effective population size low. Hence, populations are susceptible to stochastic extinction events and inbreeding. In North America, catastrophic declines of some bumble bee species since the 1990s are probably attributable to the accidental introduction of a normative parasite from Europe, a result of global trade in domesticated bumble bee colonies used for pollination of greenhouse crops. Given the importance of bumble bees as pollinators of crops and wildflowers, steps must be taken to prevent further declines. Suggested measures include fight regulation of commercial bumble bee use and targeted use of environmentally comparable schemes to enhance floristic diversity in agricultural landscapes.																		0066-4170	1545-4487		WOS:000252684300012	17803456

Here we examine which factors render some British bumblebee species more susceptible to environmental change than others. We present forage data on workers of 15 bumblebee species gathered from 172 one hour searches conducted at sites in southern UK, the Hebrices (western Scotland) and in New Zealand (to which UK bumblebees were introduced). We also review data on distribution, phenology and tongue length of these species. Overall, Fabaceae appear to be the major pollen source for most bumblebee species. In particular, long-tongued, late emerging species such as Bombus ruderatus, Bombus humilis and Bombus subterraneus specialize heavily in gathering pollen from Fabaceae, and this group of bumblebee species have all declined. Some of them are also at the edge of their geographic range in the UK, which may have rendered them more sensitive to environmental change. The decline of many bumblebee species is probably attributable largely to the loss of unimproved flower-rich grasslands, a habitat rich in Fabaceae. The bumblebee species that remain abundant are mostly short-tongued species that emerge early in the season and have less specialized diets: these species are very common in suburban gardens where they are able to exploit the broad range of floral resources. A third group of bumblebees are strongly associated with Ericaceae in moorland and heathland habitats, and have probably always had restricted distributions. A small number of species are not so easily categorised. Bombus soroeensis and B. ruderarius are not dietary specialists, nor are they close to the limit of their geographic range, but nevertheless they have declined. Much of the ecology of rare bumblebee species remains poorly understood and in need of further study. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Transportation of bumblebees accelerated in the late 1980s following the development of techniques for mass rearing them, and their widespread adoption as the preferred pollinator for a range of glasshouse crops, primarily tomatoes. There is now a worldwide trade in one species, Bombus terrestris dalmatinus, originating from south east Europe. Within North America, which does not allow the importation of B. terrestris, the trade is primarily in Bombus impatiens. Trade in B. t. dalmatinus threatens the integrity of other subspecies within Europe, such as B. t. audax which is endemic to Britain and Ireland. However, there is a conspicuous absence of data as to whether B. t. dalmatinus has established in the wild outside its native range, and whether it interbreeds with native subspecies. Perhaps a more significant risk associated with trade in bumblebees is the accidental spread of parasites, and the subsequent risk that native bumblebee species may be exposed to parasites for which they have little resistance. There is circumstantial evidence that catastrophic declines of several North American bumblebee species may have been triggered by the accidental introduction of pathogens from Europe. Even if commercial bumblebee colonies are reared locally, the high densities at which they are kept mean that glasshouse nests are likely to act as reservoirs for spread of disease to wild bumblebee populations nearby. There is clearly the need for tight quarantining of bee colonies before transportation, and a moratorium should be placed on the transport of bumblebees in cases where native species suitable for commercial rearing are readily available.																		0003-6862	1347-605X		WOS:000276579400002

The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined; bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example, pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, and studying these interactions experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted. Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies into the future.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000352136400030	25721506

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE				5	1			64	75		10.1016/j.ijppaw.2015.10.001				APR 2016	2016	Bees have been managed and utilised for honey production for centuries and, more recently, pollination services. Since the mid 20th Century, the use and production of managed bees has intensified with hundreds of thousands of hives being moved across countries and around the globe on an annual basis. However, the introduction of unnaturally high densities of bees to areas could have adverse effects. Importation and deployment of managed honey bee and bumblebees may be responsible for parasite introductions or a change in the dynamics of native parasites that ultimately increases disease prevalence in wild bees. Here we review the domestication and deployment of managed bees and explain the evidence for the role of managed bees in causing adverse effects on the health of wild bees. Correlations with the use of managed bees and decreases in wild bee health from territories across the globe are discussed along with suggestions to mitigate further health reductions in wild bees.

After importation, they interact with other pollinators, with an associated risk of any parasites they carry infecting and harming native bees. National and supranational regulations are designed to prevent this, and commercially produced bumblebee colonies are accordingly now often sold and imported as being parasite-free. Here, we used molecular methods to examine the occurrence of parasites in bumblebee colonies that were commercially produced in 2011 and 2012 by three producers. We then used controlled experiments to determine whether any parasites present were infectious. We found that 77% of the commercially produced bumblebee colonies from the three producers, which were imported on the basis of being free of parasites, in fact carried microbial parasites, with five different parasites being detected across the total sample of bumblebees and a further three in the pollen supplied with the colonies as food. Our controlled experiments demonstrated that at least three of these parasites were infectious to bumblebees with significant negative effects on their health. Furthermore, we also found that at least four of the parasites carried by commercially produced bumblebees were infectious to honeybees, indicating that they pose a risk to other pollinators as well.Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrate that commercially produced bumblebee colonies carry multiple, infectious parasites that pose a significant risk to other native and managed pollinators. More effective disease detection and management strategies are urgently needed to reduce the pathogen spillover threat from commercially produced bumblebees.The results demonstrate that commercially produced bumblebee colonies carry multiple, infectious parasites that pose a significant risk to other native and managed pollinators.

There is mounting evidence that managed honey bees or commercially produced bumblebees may affect the health of wild pollinators such as bumblebees by increasing competition for resources and the prevalence of parasites in wild bees. Here we screened 764 bumblebees from around five greenhouses that either used commercially produced bumblebees or did not, as well as bumblebees from 10 colonies placed at two sites either close to or far from a honey bee apiary, for the parasites Apicystis bombi, Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, N. ceranae, N. apis and deformed wing virus. We found that A. bombi and C. bombi were more prevalent around greenhouses using commercially produced bumblebees, while C. bombi was 18% more prevalent in bumblebees at the site near to the honey bee apiary than those at the site far from the apiary. Whilst these results are from only a limited number of sites, they support previous reports of parasite spillover from commercially produced bumblebees to wild bumblebees, and suggest that the impact of stress from competing with managed bees or the vectoring of parasites by them on parasite prevalence in wild bees needs further investigation. It appears increasingly likely that the use of managed bees comes at a cost of increased parasites in wild bumblebees, which is not only a concern for bumblebee conservation, but which may impact other pollinators as well.																		2167-8359			WOS:000347617300007	25165632

The nature and extent of bumblebee decline in North America is poorly understood due mainly to a lack of baseline and long-term data. Museum collections provide excellent sources of information on past and current species distributions, which can be used to infer changes in the composition of insect communities. Using the Illinois Natural History Survey's electronic database of Hymenoptera and a recent biodiversity survey of historically sampled localities, we were able to examine changes in the richness and distribution of the bumble bee fauna of Illinois over the last century. We found that bumble bee species richness declined substantially during the middle of the century (1940-1960). Four species were locally extirpated: Bombus borealis, Bombus temarius, Bombus terricola and Bombus variabilis. The ranges of Bombus affinis, Bombus fraternus, Bombus pensylvanicus and Bombus vagans have also decreased in Illinois. Our analyses also indicated that current bumble bee diversity is highest in northern Illinois, where conservation efforts would be most productive. Our study demonstrates that half of the bumble bee species found historically in Illinois have been locally extirpated or have suffered declines, supporting observations of broader declines in North America. Major declines in the bumble bee fauna coincided with large-scale agricultural intensification in Illinois between 1940 and 1960. Attempts to conserve bumble bees in Illinois should involve wildlife-friendly approaches to agriculture, such as increasing agricultural land set-asides and hedgerows, and employing integrated pest management.

We tested this by experimentally adding honeybee hives to nine sites while ensuring that ten additional sites were free from hives. The landscape surrounding each geographically separated site either held low (homogeneous landscape) or high (heterogeneous landscape) proportions of semi-natural grassland. Adding honeybees suppressed bumblebee densities in field borders and road verges in homogeneous landscapes whereas no such effect was detected in heterogeneous landscapes. The proportional abundance of bumblebee species with small foraging ranges was lower at honeybee sites than at control sites in heterogeneous landscapes, whereas bumblebee communities in homogeneous landscapes were dominated by a single species with long foraging range irrespective of if honeybees were added or not. We conclude that honeybees can impact bumblebee densities, but that landscape heterogeneity modified this effect.																		1439-1791	1618-0089		WOS:000385369000005

It is in the interest of the bumble bee rearing industry, which succeeds best when managed colonies are healthy and vigorous, and the safety of the environment into which the bees are introduced, to ensure that managed bees are not foci of disease. Visual detection methods using gross pathology and light microscopy, while generally efficacious if a thorough inspection routine is followed, have the disadvantage of detecting most pathogens only after maturation to the transmissible stage. Koppert Biological Systems, the only company currently rearing bumble bees in the US, has instituted a detection method using multiplex real-time PCR to evaluate colonies for presence of three pathogens, Nosema bombi, Crithidia bombi, and Apicystis bombi, all chronic pathogens with potential to build to high prevalence in rearing facilities. Added to a rigorous inspection system, PCR methods ensure that these pathogens are detected quickly and are eliminated.																		0021-8839	2078-6913		WOS:000380152100013

Although invasive species are major topics of research, little consideration has been given to the implications of introducing non-native subspecies or beneficial organisms such as pollinators. However, the extensive trade in bumble bees as pollinators of glasshouse crops involves both. Within regions in Europe, the importation of non-native commercially reared subspecies of Bombus terrestris could endanger native bumble bees through competitive displacement and/or hybridization.2. This study made a direct ecological comparison between commercially imported and native B. terrestris colonies growing in the wild in the UK. In particular, using a paired design, we compared the nectar-foraging performance and reproductive outputs of commercial and native colonies growing under identical field conditions.3. Commercial colonies performed well in the field, with substantially higher nectar-foraging rates than native colonies in four out of five locations. Nectar-foraging performance was positively correlated with forager size, with commercial bees being consistently larger than native bees.4. All seven commercial colonies studied produced gynes (new queens), with two colonies each producing in excess of 50. In contrast, only two out of seven native colonies produced gynes, and those only produced small numbers (five in total). Males were produced by all colonies but there were no significant differences in numbers between commercial and native subspecies.5. Synthesis and applications. The high reproductive success of commercial colonies indicates that there is an appreciable risk that they will become established and spread within the UK. Furthermore, their superior foraging ability and large colony size could lead them to out-compete native bumble bees. Clearly the invasive potential of non-native subspecies and/or beneficial organisms should not be overlooked. With respect to the current importation of commercial bumble bees, we strongly recommend a precautionary approach: native species and subspecies should be locally reared and the use/disposal of bees should be strictly regulated.																		0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000239987700011

Although previous studies have shown that these subspecies will interbreed, none have assessed mating preference of the different populations. This study examines the mating preferences between two geographically isolated populations of B terrestris which have unnaturally been brought together through the commercial trade in bumblebees. Under controlled choice conditions, mating between commercially imported B t dalmatinus (from South Eastern Europe) and native British B t audax was non-random. Commercially imported gynes (unfertilised queens) preferred to mate with males from the same population (71% of matings). In light of the continued escape of imported gynes and males, these results indicate that there is a possibility of establishment of South Eastern European B t dalmatinus in Britain, and that hybrids will also occur. The ecological risks of such an establishment are discussed.																		0171-8177			WOS:000235561200008

A population comparison of foraging performance in Bombus terrestris								OECOLOGIA				144	3			508	516		10.1007/s00442-005-0081-9				JUL 2005	2005	Worldwide trade in non-native bumblebees remains largely unrestricted despite well-documented cases where introductions of non-native bees have gone dramatically wrong. Within Europe, indiscriminate importation of non-native populations of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) for the pollination of glasshouse crops continues on a massive scale. However, no risk assessment has been conducted for these introductions, perhaps because B. terrestris is considered a native species, so shipping populations from one region to another has been implicitly assumed to present no risk. This view is clearly unjustified because Bombus terrestris populations differ significantly in their genetic makeup as demonstrated by strong differences in coat colour and behavioural traits. Therefore, for the first time we compare an important competitive trait, namely foraging performance, between commercially available B. terrestris populations in contrasting environments. We test whether commercially reared populations differ in their nectar foraging performance and whether this is influenced by both their source environment and the one they are introduced into. We do this by means of a reciprocal transplant experiment. Strong, consistent interpopulation differences in performance occurred irrespective of test location: Canary Island bees (B.t. canariensis) were superior to Sardinian bees (B.t. sassaricus), which were generally superior to mainland European bees (B.t. terrestris). These inter-population differences in performance were largely explained by inter-population variation in forager size, with larger bees being superior foragers. However, even when body size was accounted for, "native" bees were not superior to transplanted non-native bees in all but one case. We conclude that non-native populations, especially those with large foragers, can be highly competitive foragers. This could lead to their establishment and displacement of native bees. Therefore, we recommend that unregulated movements of non-native B. terrestris populations within Europe should not be carried out without a full risk assessment.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000231247800019	15891827

Commercially introduced pollinators in Southern France								APIDOLOGIE				41	1			1	13		10.1051/apido/2009044				JAN-FEB 2010	2010	The natural diversity of Bombus terrestris subspecies could be under threat from the commercialisation of bumblebees. Therefore, to determine whether commercially imported bumblebees are able to establish and spread, we carried out long-term observations of bumblebees in southern France. Our surveys occurred before, during, and after the importation (between 1989 and 1996) of thousands of colonies of the Sardinian subspecies B. t. sassaricus. Queens and males of B. t. sassaricus were observed foraging outside commercial greenhouses in 1991, 1993, and 1994 and feral workers were observed foraging on native vegetation nearly two years after the importation of B. t. sassaricus ceased. However, no B. t. sassaricus, or F1 hybrids were observed after 1998. We conclude that B. t. sassaricus remains inconspicuous in France and competition from the three native subspecies may have prevented it from becoming invasive. However, genetic interference through introgression cannot be ruled out.																		0044-8435			WOS:000273050600001

The prevailing hypothesis concerning their decline is the transmission of the intracellular fungal pathogen, Nosema bombi (Microsporida), and other pathogen species from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations. While N. bombi incidence has been investigated in the contiguous U.S.A. and Canada, virtually nothing is known about the status of Alaskan bumble bees. This study presents the distribution and relative abundance of B. occidentalis and B. moderatus, two co-occurring species in the subgenus Bombus sensu stricto, in Alaska and the prevalence of N. bombi detected in these species. Bombus occidentalis and B. moderatus accounted for 28% and 4% of the 942 bumble bees surveyed, respectively. Bombus occidentalis was the most abundant species collected in the survey and prevalence of N. bombi infections (44% infected) was also highest in this species. The proportion of infected B. moderatus did not differ significantly from other co-occurring bumble bees. Despite the presence of N. bombi infections, both Bombus s. str. species were commonly detected in Alaska with our survey method. Alaskan bumble bee populations may thus provide important insights on the role of pathogens, particularly N. bombi, in bumble bee decline in the contiguous U.S.A.																		0029-344X	2161-9859		WOS:000308341200006

Closely related species exist in Japan where the unrestricted import and use of B. terrestris has resulted in the establishment of wild colonies. Laboratory studies previously showed that B. terrestris and Japanese native species can copulate and produce fertilized eggs. Although these eggs do not hatch, the interspecific mating can cause a serious reproductive disturbance to native bumblebees. In this study, we determined the frequencies of interspecies mating between B. terrestris males and native bumblebee queens in the wild on the islands of Hokkaido and Honshu by analyzing the DNA sequences of spermatozoa stored in spermathecae of native queens. We found that 20.2% of B. hypocrita hypocrita queens and 30.2% of B. hypocrita sapporoensis queens had spermatozoa of B. terrestris males in their spermathecae. Given that a Bombus queen generally mates only once in her life, such high frequencies of interspecific mating with B. terrestris pose serious threats to the populations of native bumblebees in Japan.																		0028-1042			WOS:000264837500005	19089400

The distribution, status and factors threatening all 60 known taxa (species and subspecies) of Bombini of 11 countries of Western and Central Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) were assessed from the beginning of the 20th century. The analysis was based on a literature review, unpublished data, personal communications, our own observations, and an expert review. The IUCN Red List categories were used for assessing the threat of extinction. Eighty per cent of taxa were threatened in at least one country of the region, and 30% of taxa were threatened throughout their range in the countries considered. More species went extinct per country in the second than in the first half of the 20th century, and four taxa went extinct in all 11 countries during 1951-2000. Amongst the factors adversely affecting the Bombini anthropogenic factors (particularly those associated with large-scale farming schemes) appear to be of greater importance than natural factors. To halt population declines and species extinctions it will be necessary to preserve aspects of traditional farming practices and for all Bombini to be afforded legal protection in all countries of the region. The implementation of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy is likely to have the greatest single impact upon pollinators in the near future.																		0030-6053	1365-3008		WOS:000245766600017

The colonies used for this purpose are provided by commercial bumblebee breeders, which by now operate at a professional company level. As a result of this practice commercially bred bumblebee colonies are transported and used over large distances and national borders, introducing subspecies into non-endemic regions. The question whether and to what extends gene flow between such managed greenhouse and wild bumblebee populations exists, so far has not been addressed. Here we used samples from three greenhouses in Poland and the surrounding populations to address this question. Using microsatellite DNA data we found strong genetic introgression from the sampled greenhouse populations into the adjacent populations. Depending on the analysed population, the number of individuals assigned to the greenhouse populations ranged from 0.08 to 0.47. We also found that more distant populations were much less affected by genetic introgression from the greenhouses.																		1566-0621			WOS:000285971900016

Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however, because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown. Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon, Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for sustaining the service, because of year-to-year variation in community composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will destroy this "free" service, but conservation and restoration of bee habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees.																		0027-8424			WOS:000180101600056	12486221

This may lead to discrimination against potential foreign mates that may ultimately lead to reproductive isolation. However, the extent to which population differentiation in mating cues affects the species recognition has received little empirical support. Here, we investigate the consequence of geographic differentiation in male reproductive traits on female preferences to these traits in Bombus terrestris. We characterise (1) the geographic differentiation in male cephalic labial gland secretions (CLGS), a key trait for mate attraction, and (2) the preference of virgin females to the CLGS of different subspecies. Our results show geographic CLGS differences parallel with divergences in female preferences for these secretions. This geographic CLGS differentiation in males, along with female preference for sympatric males, could lead to or reflect a pre-mating isolation among subspecies.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000358743500004

While phenotypic differentiation in characters, such as size or shape among insular organisms, has been well studied, insular differentiation in quantitative reproductive traits involved in chemical communication has received very little attention to date. Here, we investigated the impact of insularity on two syntopic bumblebee species pairs: one including species that are phylogenetically related (Bombus terrestris and B. lucorum), and the other including species that interact ecologically (B. terrestris and its specific nest inquiline B. vestalis). For each bumblebee species, we characterized the patterns of variation and differentiation of insular (Corsican) vs. mainland (European) populations (i) with four genes (nuclear and mitochondrial, 3781 bp) and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results provide evidence for genetic differentiation in Corsican bumblebees and show that, contrary to theoretical expectations, island populations of bumblebees exhibit levels of genetic variation similar to the mainland populations. Likewise, our comparative chemical analyses of MMS indicate that Corsican populations of bumblebees are significantly differentiated from the mainland yet they hold comparative levels of within-population MMS variability compared to the mainland. Therefore, insularity has led Corsican populations to diverge both genetically and chemically from their mainland relatives, presumably through genetic drift, but without a decrease of genetic diversity in island populations. We hypothesize that MMS divergence in Corsican bumblebees was driven by a persistent lack of gene flow with mainland populations and reinforced by the preference of Corsican females for sympatric (Corsican) MMS. The impoverished Corsican bumblebee fauna has not led to relaxation of stabilizing selection on MMS but to consistent differentiation chemical reproductive traits on the island.																		1932-6203			WOS:000321099000085	23755263

The experiment was conducted outside, in an open area, at three sites with one stack of three colonies per site. Observations were made from the 28th to the 58th d of the colony development, before the competition point. Bumblebees were regularly marked with a colony-specific color to access the migrations and the cumulative births in colonies. The population size and the colony composition were analyzed by dissection at the end of the experiment. The results showed that approximate to 50% of the individuals observed at a hive entrance (entering and exiting individuals) were foreigners. The cumulative births became significantly lower on the lowest floor after one week of experiment. At the end of the experiment, colonies were composed of 20.58% drifters (resident since at least 1 d), and a mean migration rate of 19.82% was determined. Globally, the lowest floor seemed to be progressively abandoned by resident workers for the benefit of the other floors. Because drift induces modifications of the colony growth (potentially on the number of foragers produced and likely on pollination), we suggest to greenhouse growers not to stack colonies but to distribute them throughout the greenhouse.																		0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000251700400004	18232391

Effect of timing and exposure of sunflower pollen on a common gut pathogen of bumble bees								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				44	5			702	710		10.1111/een.12751				OCT 2019	2019	1. Several bee species are declining due to multiple factors, including pathogens. Ingestion of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) pollen can dramatically reduce the bumble bee gut pathogen Crithidia bombi, but little is known about how timing and exposure to sunflower pollen consumption affects pathogen load. 2. Two experiments were carried out to investigate how exposure to sunflower pollen relative to pathogen exposure affects Crithidia bombi in Bombus impatiens. Foraging trials with pollen-producing and male-sterile (pollen absent) sunflower lines were performed to investigate whether sunflower pollen affected pathogen transmission in a single foraging bout, and 7-day laboratory trials were done to investigate whether timing and duration of exposure to sunflower pollen after infection affected C. bombi. 3. In foraging trials, pollen presence on inflorescences inoculated with C. bombi did not affect transmission (pathogen cell counts of foraging workers) 1 week later, suggesting that a brief experience with sunflower pollen concurrent with pathogen exposure is insufficient to reduce infection. In laboratory trials, consuming sunflower pollen for the first 3.5 days or all 7 days after infection reduced cell counts compared with a negative control pollen, but consuming sunflower pollen starting 3.5 days after infection did not. Consuming sunflower pollen for 7 days was significantly and substantially more effective than any other treatment. Thus, both duration and timing of exposure to sunflower pollen may affect pathogen load. 4. These results are important for understanding ecological disease dynamics in natural settings with free-flying bumble bees, and may inform decisions about using medicinal diets to manage bumble bee health commercially.																		0307-6946	1365-2311		WOS:000483813200013

The global trade in commercial bumble bee (Bombus spp.) colonies provides pollination services for both glasshouse and open-field crops. For example, in the United Kingdom, commercial colonies of nonnative subspecies of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris L. imported from mainland Europe are widely used for the pollination of raspberries, Rubus idaeus L. The extent to which these commercial colonies supplement the services provided by wild pollinators has not been formally quantified and the impact of commercial bumble bees on native bees visiting the crop is unknown. Here, the impacts of allowing commercially available bumble bee colonies to forage on raspberry canes are assessed in terms of the yield of marketable fruit produced and the pollinator communities found foraging on raspberry flowers. No differences were found in the abundance, diversity, or composition of social bee species observed visiting raspberry flowers when commercial bumble bees were deployed compared with when they were absent. However, weight of marketable raspberries produced increased when commercial bees were present, indicating that wild pollinator services alone are inadequate for attaining maximum yields. The findings of the study suggests that proportional yield increases associated with deployment of commercial colonies may be small, but that nevertheless, investment in commercial colonies for raspberry pollination could produce very significant increases in net profit for the grower. Given potential environmental risks associated with the importation of nonnative bumble bees, the development of alternative solutions to the pollination deficit in raspberry crops in the United Kingdom may be beneficial.																		0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000287012800016	21404847

The potential for infectious pathogens to spillover and emerge from managed populations to wildlife communities is poorly understood, but ecological, evolutionary and anthropogenic factors are all likely to influence the initial exposure and subsequent infection, spread and impact of disease. Fast-evolving RNA viruses, known to cause severe colony losses in managed honeybee populations, deserve particular attention for their propensity to jump between host species and thus threaten ecologically and economically important wild pollinator communities.2. We review the literature on pollinator viruses to identify biological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence, highlight gaps in the literature, and discuss potential management strategies.3. We provide evidence that many wild pollinator species are exposed to viruses from commercial species, resulting in multiple spillover events. However, it is not clear whether species become infected as a result of spillover or whether transmission is occurring within these wild populations. Ecological traits of pollinating insects, such as overlapping ranges, niches and behaviours, clearly promote cross-species transmission of RNA viruses. Moreover, we conclude that the social behaviour and phylogenetic relatedness of social pollinators further facilitate within-and between-host transmission, leaving these species particularly vulnerable to emerging diseases.4. We argue that the commercial use of pollinators is a key driver of disease emergence in these beneficial insects and that this must be addressed by management and policy.5. Synthesis and applications. There are important knowledge gaps, ranging from disease distribution and prevalence, to pathogen life history and virulence, to the impacts of disease emergence, which need to be addressed as research priorities. It is clear that avoiding anthropogenic pathogen spillover is crucial to preventing and managing disease emergence in pollinators, with far-reaching effects on our food security, ecosystem services and biodiversity. We argue that it is crucial to prevent the introduction of diseased pollinators into natural environments, which can be achieved through improved monitoring and management practices.																		0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000352138100007	25954053

Defense against parasitism is commonly studied in the context of immune system-based mechanisms and, thus, the focus in the search for candidate genes in host-parasite interactions is often on immune genes. In this study, we investigated the association between prevalence of parasite infection and host mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes in two natural populations of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). The two most common haplotypes of the host populations, termed A and B, differ by a single nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution within the coding region of cytochrome oxidase I, an important player in metabolic pathways. We screened infection by Nosema bombi, a common endoparasite of bumblebees, and the corresponding host mtDNA-haplotype frequencies in over 1400 bumblebees between 2000 and 2010. The island population of Gotland showed lower mtDNA diversity compared to the mainland population in Switzerland. Over time, we observed large fluctuations in infection prevalence, as well as variation in host haplotype frequencies in both populations. Our long-term observation revealed that N. bombi infection of specific host genotypes is transient: We found that with increasing infection prevalence, proportionally more individuals with haplotype B, but fewer individuals with haplotype A were infected. This suggests that the presence of N. bombi in specific host genotypes relates to infection prevalence. This may be a result of parasite competition, or differential resilience of host types to ward off infections. The findings highlight the important role of host mtDNA haplotypes in the interaction with parasites.																		1567-1348	1567-7257		WOS:000417474500014	29155285

Numerous mechanisms could be behind this decline, and the spread of parasites from commercial colonies into wild populations has been implicated recently in North America. Commercial breeding may lead to declines because commercial colonies may have high parasite loads, which can lead to colonization of native bumble bee populations; commercial rearing may allow higher parasite virulence to evolve; and global movement of commercial colonies may disrupt spatial patterns in local adaptation between hosts and parasites. We assessed parasite virulence, transmission mode, and infectivity. Microparasites and so-called honey bee viruses may pose the greatest threat to native bumble bee populations because certain risk factors are present; for example, the probability of horizontal transmission of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi is high. The microsporidian parasite Nosema bombi may play a role in declines of bumble bees in the United States. Preliminary indications that C. bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi may not be native in parts of South America. We suggest that the development of molecular screening protocols, thorough sanitation efforts, and cooperation among nongovernmental organizations, governments, and commercial breeders might immediately mitigate these threats.																		0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000292907500002	21771075

One factor that may influence host resilience when facing infection is the gut microbiota. Previous experiments with Bombus terrestris, a European bumble bee, showed that the gut microbiota can protect against Crithidia bombi, a widespread trypanosomatid parasite of bumble bees. However, the particular characteristics of the microbiome responsible for this protective effect have thus far eluded identification. Using wild and commercially sourced Bombus impatiens, an important North American pollinator, we conducted cross-wise microbiota transplants to naive hosts of both backgrounds and challenged them with a Crithidia parasite. As with B. terrestris, we find that microbiota-dependent protection against Crithidia operates in B. impatiens. Lower Crithidia infection loads were experimentally associated with high microbiome diversity, large gut bacterial populations, and the presence of Apibacter, Lactobacillus Firm-5, and Gilliamella spp. in the gut community. These results indicate that even subtle differences between gut community structures can have a significant impact on a microbiome's ability to defend against parasite infections.IMPORTANCE Many wild bumble bee populations are under threat due to human activity, including through the introduction of pathogens via commercially raised bees. Recently, it was found that the bumble bee gut microbiota can help defend against a common parasite, Crithidia bombi, but the particular factors contributing to this protection are unknown. Using both wild and commercially raised bees, we conducted microbiota transplants to show that microbiome diversity, total gut bacterial load, and the presence of certain core members of the microbiota may all impact bee susceptibility to Crithidia infection. Bee origin (genetic background) was also a factor. Finally, by examining this phenomenon in a previously uninvestigated bee species, our study demonstrates that microbiome-mediated resistance to Crithidia is conserved across multiple bumble bee species. These findings highlight how intricate interactions between hosts, microbiomes, and parasites can have wide-ranging consequences for the health of ecologically important species.																		0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000427697900006	29374030

Bombus ruderatus and Bombus terrestris were sequentially introduced into Chile and later entered Argentina's Patagonian region. A large-scale survey in Patagonia reveals that, in 5 years post-arrival, the highly invasive B terrestris has become the most abundant and widespread Bombus species, and its southward spread is concurrent with the geographic retraction of the only native species, Bombus dahlbomii. Furthermore, a 20-year survey of pollinators of the endemic herb Alstroemeria aurea in northern Patagonia indicates that B ruderatus and B terrestris have replaced B dahlbomii, formerly the most abundant pollinator. Although the decline's underlying mechanisms remain unknown, the potential roles of exploitative competition and pathogen co-introduction cannot be ruled out. Given that invasive bumble bees can rapidly extirpate native congeners, further introductions should be discouraged.																		1540-9295	1540-9309		WOS:000327420800007

Our study included wild bumblebee samples from six populations in Ireland, one from the Isle of Man, four from Britain and 11 from mainland Europe. A further sample was acquired from New Zealand. Observed levels of genetic variability and heterozygosity were low in Ireland and the Isle of Man, but relatively high in continental Europe and among commercial populations. Estimates of F-st revealed significant genetic differentiation among populations. Bayesian cluster analysis indicated that Irish populations were highly differentiated from British and continental populations, the latter two showing higher levels of admixture. The data suggest that the Irish Sea and prevailing south westerly winds act as a considerable geographical barrier to gene flow between populations in Ireland and Britain; however, some immigration from the Isle of Man to Ireland was detected. The results are discussed in the context of the recent commercialization of bumblebees for the European horticultural industry.																		0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000356973100006	25958977

Concern has been expressed that it might act as an invasive species with large impact on biodiversity. However, although the honeybee has spread into the wild and has established feral populations in Australia and the Americas, the extent to which introduced honeybees alter biodiversity remains controversial. Here we focus on the best documented cases of A. mellifera invasions and discuss the effects on biodiversity under three different conditions: 1) regions where other subspecies of A. mellifera are endemic (Europe, Africa, and western Asia), 2) regions where A. mellifera is not endemic, but other species of Apis naturally occur (central and eastern Asia), 3) regions where Apis species are not endemic (America, Australia). Although some studies show an impact on native bee survival, fecundity, or population density in response to large A. mellifera aggregations (e.g., on apiaries), there are no reports that feral honeybees caused the extinction of native bee pollinators, which are the most likely competing group of organisms. Honeybee introductions have had or still may have negative effects only within the genus Apis, primarily interfering with beekeeping activities. Although honeybee invasions seem to have had little if any effect on biodiversity of native pollinators so far, we nevertheless caution against transporting honeybees around the globe, and we particularly advise against importing foreign Apis species into tropical ecosystems.																		1195-6860	2376-7626		WOS:000232582200002

Recent studies from North America suggest that disease transmission from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked range contractions in some species. In Europe, data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the EU since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland. Commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen, depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi, compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2 km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and pathogen-specific manner up to 10 km. We suggest implementing measures that prevent the interaction of commercially reared and wild bumble bees by integrating the enforcement of national best management practices for users of commercial pollinators with international legislation that regulates the sanitation of commercial hives in production facilities.

This study aimed to quantify the occurrence of natal-worker reproduction, worker drift and drifter reproduction within 14 wild colonies of Bombus terrestris in Central Scotland. Four unlinked microsatellites were used to identify patterns of relatedness of the colonies' adults and broods. In colonies with queens (queenright colonies), worker reproduction accounted for just 0.83 % of males, increasing to 12.11 % in queenless colonies. Four colonies contained a total of six workers which were not daughters of the queen, and were assumed to be drifters, and four male offspring of drifters. Drifting is clearly not common and results in few drifter offspring overall, although drifters produced approximately seven times more offspring per capita than workers that remained in their natal colony. Unexpectedly, two colonies contained clusters of sister workers and juvenile offspring that were not sisters to the rest of the adults or brood found in the colonies, demonstrating probable egg dumping by queens. A third colony contained a queen which was not a sister or daughter to the other bees in the colony. Although usurping of bumblebee colonies by queens in early season is well documented, this appears to be the first record of egg dumping, and it remains unclear whether it is being carried out by old queens or newly mated young queens.																		0340-5443	1432-0762		WOS:000316118400010

Bumble bees play a vital role in the pollination of many crops and wild flowers, and plans for their conservation require a knowledge of the dynamics and spatial scale of their foraging flights, which are, at present, poorly understood.2. We investigated the foraging range and constancy of two colonies of bumble bees Bombus terrestris L, on a mixed arable farm using harmonic radar, which has a unique capability to record the trajectories of insects flying at low altitude in the field.3. Foraging bees were fitted with lightweight radar transponders and tracked as they flew to and from the nest to forage. The resulting tracks gave information on length, direction and straightness of foraging routes. Superimposition onto a map of the foraging landscape allowed interpretation of the bees' destinations in relation to the spatial distribution of forage.4. Outward tracks had a mean length of 275.3 +/- 18.5 m (n = 65) and a range of 70-631 m, and were often to forage destinations beyond the nearest available forage. Most bees were constant to compass bearing and destination over successive trips, although one bee was tracked apparently switching between forage patches. Both outward and return tracks had a mean straightness ratio of 0.93 +/- 0.01 (n = 99). The bees' ground speeds ranged from 3.0 m s(-1) to 15.7 m s(-1) (n = 100) in a variety of wind conditions.5. The results support the hypothesis that bumble bees do not necessarily forage close to their nest, and illustrate that studies on a landscape scale are required if we are to evaluate bee foraging ranges fully with respect to resource availability. Such evaluations are required to underpin assessments of gene flow in bee-pollinated crops and wild flowers. They are also required when making decisions about the management of bees as pollinators and the conservation of bee and plant biodiversity.																		0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000082642300006

Whereas traditional epidemiological models typically assume no social structure, network theory suggests that an individual's location in the network determines its risk of infection. Empirical, especially experimental, studies of disease spread on networks are lacking, however, largely due to a shortage of amenable study systems. We used automated video-tracking to quantify networks of physical contact among individuals within colonies of the social bumble bee Bombus impatiens. We explored the effects of network structure on pathogen transmission in naturally and artificially infected hives. We show for the first time that contact network structure determines the spread of a contagious pathogen (Crithidia bombi) in social insect colonies. Differences in rates of infection among colonies resulted largely from differences in network density among hives. Within colonies, a bee's rate of contact with infected nestmates emerged as the only significant predictor of infection risk. The activity of bees, in terms of their movement rates and division of labour (e.g., brood care, nest care, foraging), did not influence risk of infection. Our results suggest that contact networks may have an important influence on the transmission of pathogens in social insects and, possibly, other social animals.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000250787000016	17713789	
J	Otterstatter, Michael C.; Thomson, James D.					Otterstatter, Michael/0000-0001-5489-014X			Does Pathogen Spillover from Commercially Reared Bumble Bees Threaten Wild Pollinators?								PLOS ONE				3	7					e2771	10.1371/journal.pone.0002771				JUL 23 2008	2008	The conservation of insect pollinators is drawing attention because of reported declines in bee species and the 'ecosystem services' they provide. This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called, 'Colony Collapse Disorder'); yet, we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen 'spillover' from commercially reared bumble bees, which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops, is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and, using laboratory experiments and the literature, estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi, a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover, and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that, during the first three months of spillover, transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However, a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly, infecting up to 35-100% of wild Bombus, and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk. In the field, although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection, the prevalences of C. bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model. Indeed, we found that spillover has allowed C. bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses. Given the available evidence, it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild Bombus in North America. Improved management of domestic bees, for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners, could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover.																		1932-6203			WOS:000264302900041	18648661

To date its pathology and impact on host fitness are not well understood. We performed a laboratory experiment investigating the pathology and fitness effects of this parasite on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We experimentally infected one group of colonies with N. bombi spores at the start of the worker production, while a second uninfected group of colonies served as controls. During colony development we collected live workers for dissections to measure infection intensities. In parallel, we measured several life history traits, to investigate costs to the host. We succeeded in infecting 11 of 16 experimental colonies. When infection occurred at an early stage of colony development, virtually all individuals were infected, with spores being found in a number of tissues, and the functional fitness of males and young queens was reduced to zero. Further, the survival of workers from infected colonies and infected males were reduced. With such severe effects, N. bombi appears to decrease its opportunities for transmission to the next host generation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

APIDOLOGIE				47	1			66	75		10.1007/s13592-015-0376-8				JAN 2016	2016	Bumblebees are regularly exported to countries outside their native range for the purposes of commercial pollination. In contrast to the tight regulations imposed on biological control introductions, the movement of bumblebees has largely been without risk assessment. This study represents the first formal assessment of establishment risk for Bombus terrestris dalmatinus in the UK. The ability of workers to survive winter conditions is seen as the primary barrier to establishment, given the year-round colony activity of this sub-species. We use standardised cold tolerance indices as outlined by the EU policy support action 'REBECA' as well as assessing rapid cold hardening (RCH) ability. Cold tolerance was comparable to that of the UK-native Bombus terrestris audax, including a strong RCH response. Results suggest that B. t. dalmatinus could survive mild UK winters in southern areas and potentially displace B. t. audax. The implications of ongoing climate change on establishment risks are discussed.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000371162900007	26855454

However, prior studies showed variable effects of nectar chemicals on infection, which could reflect variable phytochemical resistance among parasite strains. Inter-strain variation in resistance could influence evolutionary interactions between plants, pollinators, and pollinator disease, but testing direct effects of phytochemicals on parasites requires elimination of variation between bees. Using cell cultures of the bumble bee parasite Crithidia bombi, we determined (1) growth-inhibiting effects of nine floral phytochemicals and (2) variation in phytochemical resistance among four parasite strains. C. bombi growth was unaffected by naturally occurring concentrations of the known antitrypanosomal phenolics gallic acid, caffeic acid, and chlorogenic acid. However, C. bombi growth was inhibited by anabasine, eugenol, and thymol. Strains varied > 3-fold in phytochemical resistance, suggesting that selection for phytochemical resistance could drive parasite evolution. Inhibitory concentrations of thymol (4.53-22.2 ppm) were similar to concentrations in Thymus vulgaris nectar (mean 5.2 ppm). Exposure of C. bombi to naturally occurring levels of phytochemicals-either within bees or during parasite transmission via flowers-could influence infection in nature. Flowers that produce antiparasitic phytochemicals, including thymol, could potentially reduce infection in Bombus populations, thereby counteracting a possible contributor to pollinator decline.																		2045-2322			WOS:000391266400001	27883009

Nowadays, its rearing and transport have received public attention, since managed bees can transfer pathogens to wild bee populations. Therefore, guaranteeing pathogen-free bumble bees is fundamental. The major protein source used in rearing facilities is honey bee-collected pollen. This can carry pathogens, however to date, solid data on the risk of this food source to the health of bumble bees is lacking. Here we performed a large pathogen screening of non-irradiated honey bee-collected pollen to discover particles infective to Bombus terrestris. We identified seven parasites (Apicystis bombi, Ascosphaera apis, Crithidia mellificae, Nosema ceranae, Paenibacillus larvae and two parasites resembling Nosema thomsoni and Microsporidium sp. Oise) and four viruses (CBPV, DWV, IAPV and SBV) in 17 pollen batches from two major European pollen source regions (Spain and Romania). Ascosphaera apis was capable of infecting bumble bees; the larvae showed similar symptoms to chalkbrood disease reported in honey bees. Bumble bee breeding facilities need to be cautious about the potential presence of this disease, which was originally reported in honey bees. Thorough diagnostic and control methods are needed, as risk of spillover to wild bee species is possible.																		2045-2322			WOS:000460922200077	30862950	
J	Pfeiffer, KJ; Crailsheim, K								Drifting of honeybees								INSECTES SOCIAUX				45	2			151	167		10.1007/s000400050076				1998	1998	Drifting of honeybees depends on the arrangement, the colouring of the hives and on various environmental factors. Bees are able to distinguish between related and non-related individuals, so one aim of this study was to determine whether drifting also depends on relatedness. In addition we wanted to examine whether there are differences in survival of drifted bees and non-drifted bees and to model the component of alien worker bees in a colony's population.We used two non-related strains of bees. The colonies stood in rows. Each of the colonies had two non-related neighbour colonies, except for the colonies on the ends of the rows. From each colony, 200 newly emerged bees were marked individually and 100 of them were reintroduced into their original colony (native bees) and 100 into a non-related neighbouring colony (foreign bees). The marked bees were examined for presence on their 2(nd), 6(th), 9(th), 16(th), 25(th) and 34(th) day of life. Experiments were done in summer and fall.There was no difference in survival and the amount of drifting of native and foreign bees. We also found no differences in the number of drifting bees for the two non-related strains. The bees Bees of strain 1 did not show any preferences. In two experiments significantly more bees of strain 2 drifted into colonies of strain 1. Most bees drifted into the neighbouring colony next to the colony they left. In summer significantly more bees that had drifted until their 9(th) day of life, survived until the 25(th) day than bees that did not drift until that day. In fall we did not find this difference. This was true for bees of both strains.Our data support the results of Jay (1965), who found that more bees drift from a centre colony to the end colonies of a row than vice versa.With a model we calculated the component of alien worker bees living in a colony's population. On average, 22 +/- 3 % alien worker bees were calculated for edge and 42 +/- 6% for inner hives in a row in our first experiment (summer). In a second experiment (fall) the components were 13 +/- 1% for the edge colonies and 39 +/- 4% for the inner colonies in the row. Drifting seems not to be influenced by relatedness and did not shorten the lifetime of the bees. This indicates a great tolerance against drifted bees and a high intermix of an apiary's population when no precautions to reduce drifting are taken.																		0020-1812			WOS:000074245800004

This contribution reports the presence of A. bombi parasitizing both A. mellifera and Bombus terrestris at a site in Northwestern Argentine Patagonia (Bariloche, close to the border with Chile) and analyses its possible absence in the Pampas region, the most important beekeeping region of the country. In Bariloche, prevalence of A. bombi in A. mellifera was 7.6% in 2009, and 13.6% in 2010, whereas in B. terrestris it was 12.1%. Infections were not detected in 302 bee hives periodically prospected along 3 years (almost 400 000 honeybee specimens) in the Pampas. Analysis with the probability program FreeCalc2 suggested a possible absence of A. bombi in this area. Because of high virulence showed in several species of Bombus in the Northern hemisphere, A. bombi should be closely monitored in A. mellifera and in native Bombus species or other Apidae.																		1758-2229			WOS:000297148600008	23761336

Here we describe the nature and extent of reported declines, and review the potential drivers of pollinator loss, including habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens, alien species, climate change and the interactions between them. Pollinator declines can result in loss of pollination services which have important negative ecological and economic impacts that could significantly affect the maintenance of wild plant diversity, wider ecosystem stability, crop production, food security and human welfare.																		0169-5347	1872-8383		WOS:000278682500005	20188434

The experiment was carried out with two commercial cultivars of sweet pepper, 'bell' type, called Bardenas and Vergasa. The averages of the percentages of seed set per fruit of the two campaigns were 49.8% (Bardenas) and 40.7% (Vergasa) on the pollination treatment, whereas the averages of the control (self-pollination) treatment were 27.5% and 25.7%, respectively. Percentages of seed set per fruit was strongly related with the number of bee visits, but weakly with duration of visits.The number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas by pollinators or by self-pollination was assessed by staining and microscopy, resulting in a higher number of pollen grains on the bumblebees-pollinated flowers than on the control (self-pollination) ones. As a consequence of this, the number of seeds set on the bumblebees-pollinated fruits, was always higher than in the control.Flowers visited by bumblebees produced larger and heavier fruits than non-visited flowers. Because fruit external maximum diameter, length and weight were highly dependent on seed set, the use of pollinators seems to be required to obtain sweet pepper fruits with improved quality characteristics. Percentage of seed set per fruit was correlated with the number of bumblebee visits to the flowers, seeds per fruit, number of pollen grains on stigma, and the quality fruit traits. The number of pollen grains per stigma was correlated with the number of seeds per fruit. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																		0304-4238	1879-1018		WOS:000241153700006

However, parasitological studies show that most hosts are constantly challenged by a complex parasite community. Thus, neither the response of hosts to individual parasite species nor the individual impact of these parasite species is likely to be as unconstrained as studies of single host-parasite systems might suggest. In this study, the parasite community structure in spring queens of the common European bumble bee, Bombus pratorum, was assessed. By capturing queens and allowing them to rear colonies in the laboratory, the relative impact of different parasite species on fitness across the annual host life-cycle could be examined. Of 160 queens, 67% were parasitised by one or more members of a five-species parasite community. The impact of parasites varied from being highly virulent to undetectable under benign laboratory conditions. The majority of multi-parasite infections involved a high impact parasite, which resulted in the removal of associated parasites from the host population. This study shows that, whilst multiple infections occur within individual hosts, most parasites act individually on their hosts. However, multiple parasite species in the host population may constrain the host population's ability to adapt to single parasite species. (C) 2007 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Pollination in North American greenhouses is primarily mediated by industrially produced Bombus impatiens colonies. The use of B. impatiens is preferred in greenhouses because it is a native species of East North America and they are very efficient pollinators. However, B. impatiens is also host of various viruses that have been associated with colony collapse disorder in honey bees, as well as hosts to a number of bumble bee-specific pathogens and parasites. In this study, we used qPCR to screen adult worker bumble bees collected from 120 different greenhouses in central Mexico. Fifty-four locations were positive for one or more pathogens (45 %). The most frequently detected pathogen was Apicystis bombi, which was present in 32 colonies. Of these 32 A. bombi positive colonies, 15 were co-infected with at least one other pathogen or parasite, such as Locustacarus buchneri, Nosema bombi, or the viral pathogens ABPV, CBPV, DWV, IAPV and KBV. Routine use of this type of screening technology together with policy changes to restrict pathogen infested commercial bumble bees should help improve the selection of healthy commercial colonies of B. impatiens and could lead to a higher efficiency in greenhouse pollination thus providing better environmental conservation of natural Bombus spp. by preventing spillover of EIDs.																		1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000355685700009

On average 19-29 % of infections were successful and no significant differences among these host categories were found. Different sources of Nosema spores differed in their success in infecting different host colonies, suggesting genotype-genotype interactions at the level of colonies and parasite sources. In a second experiment, N. bombi obtained from B. terrestris were found to be infective for workers of B. lapidarius and B. hypnorum, although less so in these foreign hosts. On the other hand, case mortality was significantly higher in foreign hosts than in B. terrestris. Infection and high spore loads correlated with early death of the host. In addition, a factorial analysis showed that variation among-colonies-within-species explained more of the variation in infection success than the factor species per se.

Also, genetic makeup or environmental conditions have effects. 'Social immunity' focuses on defence against parasites that are particular to social living. Recently, the role of socially transmitted microbiota for defence has become a focus, too. But whether and how parasites adapt to social organisms-beyond adaptation to solitary hosts - is poorly understood. Genomic and proteomic methods, as well as network analysis, will be tools that hold promise for many unsolved questions, but to expand our concepts in the first place is a much needed agenda.																		1471-4922	1471-5007		WOS:000403029100008	28169113

Specifically, we consider (a) the genetic composition of the expanding population and the symmetry) of gene flow between African and European bees, (b) the mechanisms that favor the preservation of the African genome, and (c) the possible range and impact of the African bee in the United States.																		0066-4170	1545-4487		WOS:000188826400016	14651468

Red flowers, therefore, should be relatively difficult to detect for such insects. Nevertheless, in population biological studies in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, the Sardinian island population (B. t. sassaricus) displayed significantly higher responses to red artificial flowers (in tests of innate colour choice and detectability) than several mainland populations of the same species (Chittka et al. in Cognitive ecology of pollination, pp 106-126, 2001; Popul Ecol 46:243-251, 2004): Since there is relatively little physiological data on population differences in sensory systems, we used intracellular recording to compare photoreceptor spectral sensitivity in B. t. sassaricus and the southern European and Mediterranean population, B. t. dalmatinus. The results show both populations to be UV-blue-green trichromats, but with a small but significant increase in long-wave sensitivity in island bees. Spectral peaks were estimated at 348, 435 and 533 nm (B. t. dalmatinus) and 347, 436 and 538 nm (B. t. sassaricus) for UV, blue and green receptors, respectively. There were no significant differences in UV and blue receptor sensitivities. We found no photoreceptors maximally sensitive to red spectral light in the Sardinian population and model calculations indicate that the behavioural population differences in colour responses cannot be directly explained by receptor population differences.																		0340-7594			WOS:000246623100001	17333207

But the sensory-perceptual processes that constrain the search for food have rarely been considered. Here we evaluate the flight behavior of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) searching for artificial flowers of various sizes and colors. When flowers were large, search times correlated well with the color contrast of the targets with their green foliage-type background, as predicted by a model of color opponent coding using inputs from the bees' UV, blue, and green receptors. Targets that made poor color contrast with their backdrop, such as white, UV-reflecting ones, or red flowers, took longest to detect, even though brightness contrast with the background was pronounced. When searching for small targets, bees changed their strategy in several ways. They flew significantly slower and closer to the ground, so increasing the minimum detectable area subtended by an object on the ground. In addition, they used a different neuronal channel for flower detection. Instead of color contrast, they used only the green receptor signal for detection. We relate these findings to temporal and spatial limitations of different neuronal channels involved in stimulus detection and recognition, Thus, foraging speed may not be limited only by factors such as prey density, flight energetics, and scramble competition. Our results show that understanding the behavioral ecology of foraging can substantially gain from knowledge about mechanisms of visual information processing.																		0027-8424			WOS:000167833700053	11259668

A comparison between differently coloured populations, with consideration of the ultraviolet								JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				282	2			75	83		10.1111/j.1469-7998.2010.00709.x				OCT 2010	2010	It has been proposed that sympatric bumblebee species form mimicry rings to profit from learnt avoidance behaviour by predators. This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the predation rates of local bumblebees with those of imported non-native bumblebees, whose coat colour is different from that of local bees, so that their coloration is unfamiliar to local predators. To test whether populations of non-native bumblebees suffer higher worker loss rates during foraging, we conducted transplant experiments in the UK, Germany and Sardinia. The loss rates of foraging workers of four Bombus terrestris populations (Bombus terrestris canariensis, Bombus terrestris terrestris, Bombus terrestris sassaricus and Bombus terrestris dalmatinus) were compared, evaluating data from 989 foragers, whose flight times were monitored precisely (over 8258 h of foraging). While all of these workers display a bright UV-reflecting abdominal tip, the colours in other body parts differ strongly to the eyes of avian predators. The hypothesis that foragers from the non-native bumblebee populations, which differ in coloration from the local native population, would suffer higher predation risk was not upheld. In contrast, in one location (Sardinia) the native population had the highest loss rate. The consistent population rank order we found in terms of forager losses indicates that such losses are more prominently affected by factors other than the familiarity of local predators with aposematic colour patterns.																		0952-8369			WOS:000282177600001

Three species of bumblebee (Bombus pascuorum, B. terrestris and B. hortorum) were observed foraging on experimental arrays consisting of pair-wise combinations of four plant species: Borago officinalis, Phacelia tanacetifolia (both with simple flowers), Antirrhinum majus and Linaria vulgaris (both with complex flowers). Plant arrangements consisted of either two simple-flower species, a simple with a complex species or two complex species. The number of plants in each array was constant, while the frequency of each species was manipulated so that it was either rare, equal or common compared with its competitor. Contrary to predictions, rare plants were actually at an advantage in terms of the number of bees attracted per plant. However, rare plants were at a disadvantage in terms of pollen wastage because foragers more often went to a flower of another species after visiting a rare plant. The behaviour of bees on each plant species was further affected by plant floral complexity and the identity of the other species in the array. The three bumblebee species were markedly different in their foraging behaviour and in their responses to varying floral density and complexity. Each species preferred particular flower species. The results are discussed with reference to resource partitioning among bumblebee species.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000078086400012	28307680

More than a million colonies are sold worldwide annually to meet pollination needs. Due to mounting concerns over the transportation of bumble bees outside of their native ranges, several species native to western North American are currently being investigated as potential commercial pollinators. Here, two western, Bombus huntii Greene and Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski, and one eastern species, Bombus impatiens Cresson, are compared for their efficacy as pollinators of greenhouse-grown tomatoes. In two experiments, colonies were placed in greenhouses and compared with control plants that received no supplemental pollination. In the first experiment, seed set was significantly increased with B. huntii pollination in one variety of cherry tomatoes. In the second experiment comparing all three bumble bee species, fruit weight was an average of 25.2 g heavier per fruit pollinated by bees versus the control, and the number of days to harvest was 2.9 d shorter for bee-pollinated fruit. In some rounds of pollination, differences were found among bumble bee species, but these were inconsistent across replicates and not statistically significant overall. Additionally, fruit weight was shown to be highly correlated to fruit diameter and seed set in all tests and, thus, is shown to be a reliable metric for assessing pollination in future studies. These results suggest that commercialization of western bumble bees is a viable alternative to the current practices of moving of nonnative bees into western North America to pollinate tomatoes.																		0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000356239000005	26470206

Do pathogen spillover, pesticide use, or habitat loss explain recent North American bumblebee declines?								CONSERVATION LETTERS				5	3			232	239		10.1111/j.1755-263X.2012.00234.x				JUN 2012	2012	Several North American bumblebee species have recently undergone dramatic declines. The use of managed, pathogen-carrying bumblebees for pollination of greenhouse crops began shortly before these declines, and wild bumblebees near greenhouses now have high pathogen loads. This has led to speculation that pathogen spillover from commercial bumblebees caused declines of these species. We test this hypothesis using a large dataset of bumblebee occurrence records and agricultural census data. We find support for the pathogen spillover hypothesis for two species but no evidence that pathogen spillover caused the near disappearance of the previously widespread Bombus affinis. Furthermore, we show that pesticide use and habitat loss are unlikely to be major causes of decline for any of the Bombus species examined. Collectively, our analyses underscore that there remains an urgent need to identify causes of pollinator population losses.																		1755-263X			WOS:000305282500009

Some devastating livestock diseases are endemic in many parts of the world and threats from old and new pathogens continue to emerge, with changes to global climate, agricultural practices and demography presenting conditions that are especially favourable for the spread of arthropod-borne diseases into new geographical areas. Zoonotic infections that are transmissible either directly or indirectly between animals and humans are on the increase and pose significant additional threats to human health and the current pandemic status of new influenza A (H1N1) is a topical example of the challenge presented by zoonotic viruses. In this article, we provide a brief overview of some of the issues relating to infectious diseases of livestock, which will be discussed in more detail in the papers that follow.																		0962-8436			WOS:000268978500001	19687034

An increase in the use of commercial pollinator colonies associated with these crops may promote the spillover of managed pollinators into nearby natural habitats. There, these managed pollinators can exploit floral resources similar to those of wild pollinators, and thus increase competition for local resources. Nonetheless, managed pollinator spillover has been poorly studied and research has focused on only one species, the western honeybee (Apis mellifera). In south-western Spain, we investigated the presence, density and exploitation of floral resources by managed (Bombus terrestris) and native bumblebees (B. L lusitanicus) in 19 Mediterranean pinewood understories across a landscape gradient of strawberry polytunnel greenhouse cover. Sampling was performed over two consecutive years in two seasons: winter, when strawberries begin flowering and farmers frequently use colonies, and spring, when there is greater availability of floral resources and wild pollinators thrive. In winter, the density of managed bumblebees in pinewoods was higher than that of native bumblebees. The presence of managed and native bumblebees in pinewoods showed contrasting patterns in relation to greenhouse cover in the landscape. The presence of managed bumblebees was positively associated with greenhouse cover, whereas that of native bumblebees was negatively associated with greenhouse cover. Overall, the presence and density of bumblebees did not differ between seasons. The two bumblebee subspecies showed similar wild flowering plant preferences, particularly in winter, when flowering plant species are scarce. We conclude that, although managed bumblebees are placed in greenhouse crops, their pollination role extends beyond these crops. Further studies are needed to assess the pollination function of managed pollinators in crops in order to reduce their spillover into natural habitats and thus, the risks posed to native pollinators.																		0167-8809	1873-2305		WOS:000468247700024

Interspecific crossing of B. terrestris with indigenous B. hypocrita sapporoensis and B. ignitus can cause inviable hybrid production under laboratory conditions. Additionally, nearly 30% of B. hypocrita sapporoensis and B. hypocrita hypocrita queens are estimated to copulate with B. terrestris males in the field, suggesting that genetic deterioration of indigenous bumblebees is possible through hybridization with the introduced species. We briefly review interspecific reproductive isolation mechanisms and discuss the negative impacts of B. terrestris on the reproduction of indigenous bumblebee species in Japan due to interspecific mating.																		0003-6862	1347-605X		WOS:000276579400007

Recently, several new genetic variants of N. bombi without a defined taxonomic status were identified in natural bumblebee populations from Russia, China, and several European countries, as well as N. ceranae, originally isolated from honey bees, was described in bumblebee species. Thus, it is required to investigate more Nosema variability in bumblebee populations for identifying new genetic Nosema variants. In our study, we used several methods such as total DNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning, sequencing, and comparative and phylogenetic analysis to investigate a prevalence of N. bombi and its diversity in the natural populations of bumblebees across West Siberia. DNA was extracted from intestinal bumblebee tissues. Identification of the parasite was conducted, using PCR with primers specific for the ribosomal RNA gene cluster and methionine aminopeptidase 2 gene of N. bombi followed by sequencing. Seven hundred twenty-seven individual bumblebees belonging to 16 species were tested; 64 specimens revealed presence of the parasite. Prevalence of Nosema bombi infection was different in each region and varied from 4 to 20 %. No infection was found in Bombus agrorum (n = 194) and Bombus equestris (n = 132), both common bumblebees in West Siberia. Three different genetic variants of the same species, N. bombi, were identified. The first variant belonged to N. bombi (AY008373) identified by Fies et al. (J Apicult Res 40:91-96, 2001), second (N. bombi WS2) was identical to the West Siberian variant identified by Szentgyorgyi et al. (Polish Journal of Ecology 59:599-610, 2011), and the last variant, N. bombi WS3, was new. The results led us to suggest that the prevalence of the N. bombi is related to the population structure of bumblebees and distribution of the particular genetic variants of N. bombi.																		0932-0113	1432-1955		WOS:000359865600021	26063531	
J	Velthuis, Hayo H.

Five species of bumblebees are currently used for crop pollination, the major ones being Bombus terrestris from Eurasia and Bombus impatiens from North America. As a result of their frequent use in foreign territories, there have been reports of B. terrestris becoming established, as well as interactions and/or competition with local (bumble-) bee fauna. Of the many vegetable, fruit and seed crops that bumblebees pollinate, greenhouse tomatoes are of predominant importance. In 2004, 40 000 ha of tomato crops were pollinated, with a crop value of e 12 000 million. The growers benefit from bumblebee pollination because of lower production costs, increased yields, and improved fruit quality. The interrelationship between commercial mechanisms and ecological risks is discussed.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000238973900002

This study investigates whether diseases from commercial bumble bees threaten native species in the UK. We sampled bumble bees from ten soft fruit farms: five that deploy commercial Bombus terrestris and five that do not. Each farm was visited monthly throughout the summer and workers of B. terrestris; B. pratorum, B. pascuorum and B. lapidarius were captured. The faeces of these bees were inspected for the gut microparasites Crithidia spp., Nosema bombi and Apicystis bombi. Prevalence was defined as the proportion of individuals infected and abundance was defined as the number of pathogen cells per volume of bumble bee faeces. The prevalence of A. bombi and N. bombi was too low to analyse. The prevalence and abundance of Crithidia spp. was significantly different among bumble bee species. Overall, the prevalence of Crithidia spp. was initially lower on farms deploying commercial bumble bees, possibly due to a dilution effect caused by the high density of imported bees. Crithidia spp. prevalence in Bombus terrestris, however, rose sharply on commercial farms at the end of the season. One potential explanation is that commercial bumble bees contract the local pathogen, which is then rapidly transmitted among them due to the high bee density. Whilst our data provide no evidence of pathogen spillover to wild species, it would be premature to conclude with certainty that commercial colonies do not represent a disease risk to native bees in the UK and we urge further studies into this phenomenon.																		0021-8839	2078-6913		WOS:000322418500006		
J	Whittington, R; Winston, ML								Are bumble bee colonies in tomato greenhouses obtaining adequate nutrition?								CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST				135	6			883	892						NOV-DEC 2003	2003	Managed bumble bees are important pollinators of greenhouse crops, but few studies have examined factors that affect the health and productivity of commercially produced colonies. We investigated whether supplemental feeding with diverse pollens affected worker longevity and colony size of Bombus occidentalis Greene (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies in tomato (Solanaceae) greenhouses. We found no differences in colony worker populations, brood production, or queen and drone production between supplemented and nonsupplemented treatments, suggesting that B. occidentalis colonies obtain adequate nutrition from the tomato pollen available in greenhouses. Adult populations did not increase in any treatment, but either remained stable or declined after colonies were placed in greenhouses. Because brood-rearing increased in all treatments but adult populations did not, adult mortality due to a non-nutritional factor such as disease or disorientation appears to be an important problem limiting the size of bumble bee colonies, and thus the effectiveness of bumble bees for greenhouse tomato pollination.																		0008-347X			WOS:000187578200010

Pollen was collected from bumblebees at three greenhouses between February and September 2001 and the plant species identity of pollen collected was determined with light microscopy. A significant amount of non-tomato pollen was collected by bumblebees during. one or more months from outside each of the three greenhouses studied. The bees brought black as little as an average of 5% non-tomato pollen between February and September at one greenhouse and as much as 73% during July at another. Therefore, greenhouse, tomato growers are probably not obtaining maximum pollination benefit from bumblebee colonies and should address methods to reduce their foraging outside the greenhouse.																		0008-4220	1918-1833		WOS:000222139300021		
J	Williams, P								Does specialization explain rarity and decline British bumblebees? - A response to Goulson et al.								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				122	1			33	43		10.1016/j.biocon.2004.06.019				MAR 2005	2005	Recent studies of British bumblebees have proposed a seemingly simple explanation for the decline in some species: that greater dietary specialization among the rarer species has put them at greater risk. However, comparisons of dietary specialization require: (I) that bees have access to the same dietary options among which to make their choices; (2) that the differing relative breadths of dietary choices made are not obscured by the differing sample sizes among bee species. Using one of the few suitable data sets, I find no evidence for a relationship between, on the one hand, rarity or declines in British bumblebees and, on the other, their dietary breadths, the strengths of their dietary preferences, or their proboscis lengths (which influence dietary choices). In contrast, there is support for a relationship between rarity or declines within Britain and the sizes of species' European ranges, particularly when these measures are adjusted to represent their ranges near sea level. Adjusted range sizes may reflect overall niche breadth and perhaps climatic and habitat specialization. This is not to say that climate change is the driving factor for declines or that changing food-plant availability is unimportant, but that climatic and habitat specialization may be a better indicator of risk of decline, which deserves further study.

We find that there is evidence that some bumblebee species are declining in Europe, North America, and Asia. People believe that land-use changes may be having a negative effect through reductions in food plants in many parts of the world, but that other factors such as pathogens may be having a stronger effect for a few species in some regions (especially for Bombus s. str. in North America). Evidence so far is that greater susceptibility to land-use change is associated world-wide with small climatic ranges, range edges, and late-starting colony-development cycles. More evidence is needed on the roles of pollen specialization, nest sites, hibernation sites, and pesticides. It is still too early to assess the success of schemes aimed at improving forage in agricultural and conservation areas. However, schemes aimed at raising public awareness have been very successful. Until proven safe, we recommend that live bumblebees should not be moved across continents or oceans for commercial pollination.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000267832600012

Several species are now in serious decline, so conservationists need to know precisely which ones are involved. The problem is that many Bombus s. str. species are cryptic, so that species identification from morphology may be impossible for some individuals and is frequently misleading according to recent molecular studies. This is the first review of the entire subgenus to: (1) avoid fixed a priori assumptions concerning the limits of the problematic species; and (2) sample multiple sites from across the entire geographic ranges of all of the principal named taxa worldwide; and (3) fit an explicit model for how characters change within an evolutionary framework; and (4) apply explicit and consistent criteria within this evolutionary framework for recognising species. We analyse easily-obtained DNA (COI-barcode) data for 559 sequences from 279 localities in 33 countries using general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) models, assuming only the morphologically distinctive species B. affinis Cresson, B. franklini (Frison), B. ignitus Smith and B. tunicatus Smith, and then recognise other comparable COI-barcode groups as putative species. These species correspond to modified concepts of the taxa B. cryptarum (Fabricius), B. hypocrita Perez, B. jacobsoni Skorikov, B. lantschouensis Vogt n. stat., B. longipennis Friese, B. lucorum (Linnaeus), B. magnus Vogt, B. minshanensis Bischoff n. stat., B. occidentalis Greene, B. patagiatus Nylander, B. sporadicus Nylander, B. terrestris (Linnaeus) and B. terricola Kirby (a total of 17 species). Seven lectotypes are designated. Our results allow us for the first time to diagnose all of the putative species throughout their global ranges and to map the extent of these geographic ranges.																		1477-2000	1478-0933		WOS:000305512500002

(Hymenoptera : Apidae)								APIDOLOGIE				39	4			419	427		10.1051/apido:2008020				JUL-AUG 2008	2008	A major determinant of bumblebees pollination efficiency is the distance of pollen dispersal, which depends on the foraging distance of workers. We employ a transect setting, controlling for both forage and nest location, to assess the foraging distance of Bombus terrestris workers and the influence of environmental factors on foraging frequency over distance. The mean foraging distance of B. terrestris workers was 267.2 m +/- 180.3 m (max. 800 m). Nearly 40% of the workers foraged within 100 m around the nest. B. terrestris workers have thus rather moderate foraging ranges if rewarding forage is available within vicinity of the nests. We found the spatial distribution and the quality of forage plots to be the major determinants for the bees foraging decision-making, explaining over 80% of the foraging frequency. This low foraging range has implications for using B. terrestris colonies as pollinators in agriculture.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000257144400005

Yet despite their importance, many aspects of bumble bee biology have remained enigmatic until the rise of the genetic and, more recently, genomic eras. Here, we review and synthesize new insights into the ecology, evolution and behaviour of bumble bees that have been gained using modern genetic and genomic techniques. Special emphasis is placed on four areas of bumble bee biology: the evolution of eusociality in this group, population-level processes, large-scale evolutionary relationships and patterns, and immunity and resistance to pesticides. We close with a prospective on the future of bumble bee genomics research, as this rapidly advancing field has the potential to further revolutionize our understanding of bumble bees, particularly in regard to adaptation and resilience. Worldwide, many bumble bee populations are in decline. As such, throughout the review, connections are drawn between new molecular insights into bumble bees and our understanding of the causal factors involved in their decline. Ongoing and potential applications to bumble bee management and conservation are also included to demonstrate how genetics- and genomics-enabled research aids in the preservation of this threatened group.																		0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000356615200004	25865395

Workers in several bee species travel to conspecific nests (drifting'), enter them, and produce male offspring inside them, so acting as intra-specific social parasites. This adds a new dimension to bees' reproductive behaviour and spatial ecology, but the extent to which drifting occurs over field scales, i.e. at natural nest densities in field conditions, has been unclear. 2. Using the bumble bee Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus) as a model system, we sought to determine rates of worker drifting at field scales and the frequency of potential drifter workers in wild nests. 3. A field experiment with 27 colonies showed that workers travelled to, and became accepted in, conspecific nests that were up to 60m away, although the number of accepted drifter workers within nests fell significantly with distance. The rate at which nests were entered by drifters was relatively high and significantly exceeded the rate at which drifters became accepted. 4. Microsatellite genotyping of eight field-collected nests from Greater London, U.K., showed that a low frequency (3%) of workers were not full sisters of nestmate workers and hence were likely to have been drifter workers. 5. It is therefore concluded that workers can drift to conspecific nests over field scales and confirmed that successful drifting occurs in natural populations. Drifting appears to be a natural but low-frequency behaviour permitting B. terrestris workers to gain direct fitness.																		0307-6946	1365-2311		WOS:000335751300010
