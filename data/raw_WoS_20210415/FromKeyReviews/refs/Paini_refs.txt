J	AIZEN, MA; FEINSINGER, P					Aizen, Marcelo/0000-0001-9079-9749			HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, NATIVE INSECT POLLINATORS, AND FERAL HONEY-BEES IN ARGENTINE CHACO SERRANO								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				4	2			378	392		10.2307/1941941				MAY 1994	1994	In subtropical dry forest (Chaco Serrano) of Tucuman province, northwestem Argentina, we assessed responses of the flower-visitor assemblage to habitat fragmentation by monitoring insect visits to two spring-flowering tree species and by sampling insects with yellow pan traps. Each of four study sites contained a tract of continuous forest, one large (> 2.2 ha) forest fragment, and one small (< 1 ha) fragment, with fragments isolated for 5-20 yr preceding the study. During its respective flowering peak each tree species examined, Prosopis nigra (Mimosoideae) and Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), dominated the sites' entomophilous flora.Results indicate that flower-visitor assemblages respond to landscape features on the scale of hectares; specifically, forest fragmentation in the Chaco Serrano leads to an insect flower-visitor fauna increasingly dominated by the exotic honey bee (Apis mellifera). Bees as a group made >90% of observed flower visits to both plant species. The honey bee alone made 82% of all visits to the early-flowering tree species P. nigra and 44% to the later flowering C australe. Frequency and taxon richness of native flower-visitors at both plant species declined with decreasing forest-fragment size, but frequency of honey bee visits tended to increase in complementary fashion, such that the total frequency of insect visits to flowers of either plant species varied little with fragment size. Frequencies of visits by honey bees and those by native insects were also negatively correlated across individual trees. In both plants, visits by native insects were most consistent (varied the least among plants or over time) in large forest tracts, whereas honey bee visits to C australe were most consistent in small fragments. In pan trap samples the relative frequency of honey bees increased with decreasing fragment size. Native flower-visitors sampled by pan traps increased in numbers and taxon richness both with increasing patch size and as spring progressed. Thus, fragmentation of the Chaco Serrano appears to (a) affect native flower-visitors adversely and to (b) facilitate honey bees' access to floral resources. It is not clear that these two effects are directly related to each other, however.																		1051-0761			WOS:A1994NH00100018

Also examined were levels of dietary overlap between these animals and their foraging in relation to resource availability. The potential for interspecific competition in different conditions was examined. Insights were also sought into the impact of these wild and domestic herbivores on the arid zone pastures. The diet of red kangaroos was based around grasses, except in wet seasons when forb intake was high. In dry seasons shrubs were also eaten but in severe drought grass intake was almost 90%. The diets of sheep showed a similar pattern but were more variable. While grass was important in their diet, they ate more forbs in wet times and much more shrub in dry conditions than the kangaroos. However, in drought they had a high dietary overlap with the kangaroos. Rabbits had broad diets in good conditions but ate much browse (bark, twigs and roots) in drought. The data pointed to marked competition between the herbivores, with sheep impacting more on kangaroos when pasture conditions began to deteriorate. A decline of perennial shrubs in these arid rangelands was considered probable because of the emphasis of sheep and rabbits on them in dry times; the dominant chenopod shrubs do not survive persistent heavy grazing.																		0140-1963			WOS:A1994NE60500005

J	Gross, CL				Management, Ecosystem/C-2259-2011				The effect of introduced honeybees on native bee visitation and fruit-set in Dillwynia juniperina (Fabaceae) in a fragmented ecosystem								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				102	1			89	95		10.1016/S0006-3207(01)00088-X				NOV 2001	2001	The endemic shrub Dillwynia juniperina is found in fragmented woodlands on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. The species obligatorily relies on pollinators to effect fruit-set and in this study the effect of fragmentation and the presence of the introduced honeybee on fruit-set was examined at two locations. Over two seasons Dillwynia juniperina was not pollen-limited indicating that flowers were saturated with pollen and that adequate bee servicing was occurring. Two native bee species (Leioproctus sp. 1 and Lasioglossum sp.) and the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera L., were the. most common visitors to flowers. Bee abundance varied between sites with honeybees being more common than native bees at one site. Native bees were never the most dominant pollinator. Visitation data show that native bees spend more time at flowers than introduced bees, although on average honeybees visit slightly more flowers on a bush than do native bees. Visitation data also revealed that native bee presence at bushes is negatively correlated with the presence of honeybees at the same bushes. At one of the study sites, honeybees were very abundant, but very few native bees were ever recorded over the 3 years. Results show that flowers can be pollinated from a single visit by a honeybee or native bee. Extrapolation of visitation data showed that native bees could on their own adequately service flowers in some years at some sites while at other times introduced honeybees may be necessary to augment pollination services.

J	Gross, CL; Mackay, D				Management, Ecosystem/C-2259-2011; Mackay, Duncan A/A-9966-2011				Honeybees reduce fitness in the pioneer shrub Melastoma affine (Melastomataceae)								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				86	2			169	178		10.1016/S0006-3207(98)00010-X				NOV 1998	1998	The agistment of managed hives of the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera, in or adjacent to conservation areas in Australia is controversial. The effects, if any, of honeybee-foraging on native plants and their native-bee pollinators is poorly understood as most studies to date have concentrated on bird-pollinated systems. Furthermore, such studies have been undertaken in temperate Australia where feral and managed hives have been present for more than 150 years. In tropical Australia the impact of honeybees on the native biota is not known-yet the information is needed to assist with planning for the management of the large areas now under control of conservation authorities. We undertook a comparative study of honeybee and native bee pollination of the pioneer species Melastoma affine in tropical north Queensland, Australia, at a site where honeybees were recently introduced as managed hives. Melastoma affine is utilised by many animals in this ecosystem and its pollination mechanism is representative of several other pioneer species of the rainforest margin. Melastoma affine obligately relies on bee pollination to effect seed-set. Native bees were the most abundant floral visitors to M. affine although significantly more honeybees than native bees were sometimes present at flowers at the end of the morning. Honeybees were poor pollinators of M. affine compared with native bees. Honeybees deposited significantly less pollen on stigmas than native bees and honeybees actively removed pollen from stigmas. Consequently, fruit-set was less likely and seed-set was significantly lower in flowers to which honeybees were the last visitor, compared with cases where native bees were the last visitor-and the last visitor to M. affine flowers was most often A. mellifera. In 91% of interactions between honeybees and native bees, native bees were disturbed from foraging at flowers by honeybees. Honeybees reduced fitness in M. affine in this study and we thus conclude that honeybees are an undesirable introduction in montane tropical-rainforest systems in Australia and based on our findings we strongly recommend that honeybees not be agisted in or adjacent to conservation areas in the wet tropics of Australia.

Chalicodoma spp. spent less time at each flower during the afternoon in quadrats where B. terrestris foraged than at quadrats from which B. terrestris was excluded, indicating that standing crops of nectar were depleted by B. terrestris during the course of the day. This decline in resources was associated with reductions in the numbers of flowers visited, and the amount of time spent foraging, by Chalicodoma spp. II is proposed that the native bees avoided foraging in the quadrat where B, terrestris occurred as a response to reduced foraging efficiency in that situation. Thus, B. terrestris displaced these two species of Chalicodoma through competition for a limited resource. The high densities at which B. terrestris occurred, together with its ability to Forage at lower ambient temperatures than the native bees, exacerbated the impact of this exotic species. The possibility that this will adversely affect pollination in G. huegelii is also discussed.																		0004-959X			WOS:000080646400006

Its impacts have been documented extensively in relatively depauperate invertebrate communities, but not in species-rich habitats such as tropical rain forests. Here we describe the local distribution of P. megacephala and its impacts on native invertebrate assemblages in and around a rain forest patch at Howard Springs, in Australia's monsoonal tropics. P. megacephala was found to be confined to a single area of approximately 25 ha, with its distribution centered on drainage lines and the rain forest. Significant but weak correlations were found between its abundance and vegetative canopy cover (positive) and distance from the rain forest (negative). In the most heavily infested area within the rain forest, the abundance of P. megacephala was 37-110 times that of total native ant abundance found within uninfested plots, as measured by pitfall traps. The abundance and richness of native ants and other invertebrates were significantly reduced in litter samples, pitfall catches and foliage beats where P. megacephala was present, inversely relative to the abundance of P. megacephala. Only two individuals of a single native ant species were found within the most infested plot, with native ant richness being reduced to about half in the least infested plot. The most persistent functional groups of native ants in infested plots were Cryptic species, which forage primarily within soil and leaf litter, and Opportunists, which exhibit highly generalised foraging behaviour. The highest abundance of P. megacephala corresponded with a 42-85% decrease in the abundance of other native invertebrates. Insect larvae were totally absent from foliage beats collected at the most heavily infested plot. P. megacephala was found overall to be expanding its range, averaging 12 m range expansion in the dry season and contracting 7 m in the wet season. It is able to spread into surrounding savanna habitats by occupying relatively sheltered microsites, such as beneath logs and at the bases of trees. However, it is unlikely to attain high population densities in open savanna habitats because of its relative intolerance of desiccation, and the prevalence of behaviourally dominant native ant species. Howard Springs is currently the only rain forest patch in monsoonal Australia known to be infested by P. megacephala, but clearly this ant is a serious potential threat to the region's rain forest invertebrate fauna.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000082858900016	28308311	
J	Horskins, K; Turner, VB								Resource use and foraging patterns of honeybees, Apis mellifera, and native insects on flowers of Eucalyptus costata								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				24	3			221	227		10.1046/j.1442-9993.1999.00965.x				JUN 1999	1999	Introduced honeybees have become well established throughout Australia and concerns have been raised about their impact on the native flora and fauna. Such concerns include the possible depletion of nectar resources by honeybees to the detriment of native animals and the ability of honeybees to pollinate Australian plants. The foraging patterns and resource utilization of honeybees (Apis mellifera) and native insects on flowers of yellow Mallee (Eucalyptus costata) (Behr & F. Muell, ex E Muell.) were studied in Wyperfeld National Park during spring 1994. Seventy-four insect species visited the flowers with the most prevalent being honeybees, native bees (Lasioglossum and Hylaeus) and ants (Iridiomyrmex). Honeybees began foraging at lower temperatures than native bees and hence had initial access to the nectar supply that was primarily produced overnight by E. costata. However, the majority (90%) of early morning visits to flowers by honeybees involved the collection of pollen. Honeybees did not forage for nectar in substantial numbers until after native insects were active. Despite both consumption and evaporation, nectar supplies remained available at midday and at one site remained available for consumption at dusk. Honeybees regularly made contact with the receptive stigmata while foraging for pollen and hence had pollen loads consisting of numerous E. costata grains present on their body. These activities are indicative of the behaviour required by insects to facilitate pollination. Given the unique morphology of many native flowers and the contrasting findings from studies to date, it is critical that generalisations about the effect of honeybees in the Australian environment are not made from studies on a limited number of native plant species.																		0307-692X			WOS:000080977800004		
J	Huryn, VMB								Ecological impacts of introduced honey bees								QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY				72	3			275	297		10.1086/419860				SEP 1997	1997	Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), native to Eurasia and Africa, have been introduced to most of the rest of the world. Many plant species are used by introduced honey bees, which suggests a high potential for disturbance of native plant/pollinator relationships. Few species are used intensively, however, thus decreasing the opportunity for disturbance. Pollination studies show that honey bees are effective pollinators of some native plants and less effective pollinators of others; they also reduce floral resources in some species with little or no pollination. Data are insufficient to show whether honey bee foraging on native plants significantly alters pollen and gene flow, but unusual foraging behavior by honey bees is not evident compared to many other pollinators. Honey bees do not physically damage plants; they are also unlikely to increase hybridization of native flora. Pollination by honey bees probably contributes little to the success of most weeds.Experiments have not shown competition for nesting sites between honey bees and native fauna. The presence of honey bees, however, alters the foraging behavior and abundance of some native fauna on flowers, but not studies have shown detrimental impacts of honey bees on population abundance of any native animals or plants. Anecdotal and quantitative reports of increased honey bee abundances on flowers compared with native fauna are often confounded with habitat changes induced by men.																		0033-5770	1539-7718		WOS:A1997XT77700002		
J	Kato, M; Shibata, A; Yasui, T; Nagamasu, H								Impact of introduced honeybees, Apis mellifera, upon native bee communities in the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands								RESEARCHES ON POPULATION ECOLOGY				41	2			217	228						1999	1999	The Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands are oceanic islands located in the northwest Pacific, and have ten native (nine endemic) bee species, all of which are nonsocial. The European honeybee (Apis mellifera), which was introduced to the islands for apiculture in the 1880s, became naturalized in a few islands shortly after introduction. To detect the impact of the honeybees upon native bee diversity, we analyzed pollen harvest by honeybees and surveyed the relative abundance of honeybees and native bees on flowers on several islands. Both hived and feral honeybee colonies were active throughout the year, harvesting pollen of both native and alien flowers and from both entomophilous and anemophilous flowers. Honeybees strongly depended on the alien plants, especially during winter to spring when native melittophilous flowers were rare. From June to November, honeybees exhaustively utilized native flowers, which had originally been utilized and pollinated by native bees. On Chichi and Haha Islands, where human disturbance of forests has been severe, both native and alien flowers were dominated by honeybees, and native bees were rare or extinct even in well-conserved forests. In contrast, on Ani Island and Haha's satellite islands where primary forests were well conserved and honeybees were still uncommon or absent, native bees remained dominant. These results suggest that competition for nectar and pollen of the native flowers between honeybees and native bees favors honeybees on the disturbed islands, which are thoroughly invaded by alien nectariferous, sometimes aggressive, weedy plants.																		0034-5466			WOS:000083085600012		
J	Kato, Makoto								Endangered bee fauna and its floral hosts in the Ogasawara Islands								Japanese Journal of Entomology				60	3			487	494						1992	1992	Native bee fauna of the Ogasawara Islands, originally composed of nine endemic species, is now endangered due to rapid destruction of natural vegetation and to competition with feral honeybees (Apis mellifera). In 1991, only one and six native species were confirmed in Chichi and Haha Islands, respectively, where the destruction progressed. Eight natives still remained in Ani Is., where natural vegetation is well conserved and honeybees are not yet common. All native bees were found only in natural vegetation. Lithurge ogasawarensis, which is oligolectic to Hybiscus glaber and possesses the longest proboscis among the natives, survived in Ani and Haha Isls., but should become extinct in Chichi Is. Megachile asahinai, whose proboscis length is equal to that of a honeybee and visits on flowers with moderately deep corollas, was found in Ani Is.																		0915-5805			BCI:BCI199395039929

In 1994 and 1995 I conducted a live-trapping survey at 152 sires throughout its potential geographic range. Detailed floristic, physiognomic, topographic and geology data from each site were used to develop a predictive model of bettong habitat requirements, using generalized linear modeling. Data from 62 spotlighting censuses and opportunistic observations were also used to assess potential threats to northern bettongs posed by introduced foxes Vulpes vulpes, while trapping and habitat data were employed to evaluate possible effects of rooting-damage from feral pigs and competition from rufous bettongs Aepyprymnus rufescens on northern bettong populations. The northern bettong was detected in only one area, the Lamb Range, where it was present at nearly half (33/70) of the sites surveyed. Sparse populations recorded previously at several other localities in north Queensland may have declined or disappeared. A multiple Poisson regression model indicated that northern bettongs were strongly associated with certain types of wet and mesic sclerophyll forests and woodlands, while rainforest and rainforest-invaded wet sclerophyll forests were avoided. Northern bettongs occurred only on infertile metamorphic and granitic substrates, and were never detected on richer basaltic or alluvial soils. This probably occurs because fruit-bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are a key food resource of northern bettongs, are most abundant on infertile soils. Foxes were never detected during the survey, and are unlikely to threaten northern bettong populations at present. Circumstantial evidence suggests that interspecific competition from rufous bettongs is also of minimal importance. Rooting damage by feral pigs, however, may be more significant; northern bettongs were rarely detected at sites with heavy pig damage, and this may be because pigs are also feeding on fungal fruit-bodies. At present, the greatest threat to northern bettongs is probably encroaching land development, especially in the crucial Lamb Range area. Northern Queensland is experiencing rapid population growth, and local shires are attempting to shunt residential development onto areas with infertile soils to avoid the lass of productive agricultural land. While normally a laudable practice, this is precisely the wrong policy in this specific region. A re-evaluation of the strategic development plans of local shires is urgently needed to protect remaining habitats of the northern bettong. Habitat management, especially regular burning, is also required in key bettong habitats. Burning will prevent further invasion of wet sclerophyll forests by rainforest vegetation, which renders the habitat unsuitable for bettongs, and also is likely to promote the local production of fungal fruit-bodies upon which the northern bettong is highly dependent.

INTERACTIONS WITH INTRODUCED MAMMAL SPECIES								WILDLIFE RESEARCH				20	4			495	511		10.1071/WR9930495				1993	1993	This paper reports a study of the interactions between a remnant population of the rufous hare-wallaby, Lagorchestes hirsutus, and populations of several introduced mammal species in a region of the Tanami Desert. Transect counts of faecal pellets and tracks were used to determine the local distributions of all species and analysis of faeces from both predators and competitors of hare-wallabies was undertaken.Six species of introduced mammals were recorded within the study area: dingoes, rabbits, camels, foxes, feral cats and cattle. The local distributions for a number of these species were found to be significantly correlated with that of L. hirsutus during some seasons. Analysis of dingo scats collected from fire trails within the study area identified a total of 12 different food classes including hare-wallabies which occurred in 6.9% of the scats. Foxes and feral cats appear to be more important predators as demonstrated by their impacts on natural and reintroduced populations of hare-wallabies. Comparison of the diets of the rabbit and L. hirsutus identified significant overlap in utilised plant species, particularly during drier times. Competition between rabbits and L. hirsutus seems probable, given the overlap of their diets and their similar body sizes and metabolic requirements. Cattle and camels are potentially as important at densities above present levels.The complex web of interactions between L. hirsutus and these introduced species have important implications for management of remnant and reintroduced hare-wallaby populations.																		1035-3712			WOS:A1993MC17400007

J	Pearson, D. J.; Kinnear, J. E.								A review of the distribution, status and conservation of Rock-wallabies in Western Australia								Australian Mammalogy				19	2			137	152						Sept., 1997	1997	Western Australia has five species of rock-wallabies. Petrogale brachyotis, Petrogale burbidgei and Petrogale concinna occur in wet-dry tropical habitats in the Kimberley region. Petrogale rothschildi is a Pilbara region endemic, while Petrogale lateralis has the largest distribution, extending from the southwest Kimberley to islands off the southern coastline. There have been few collections of the three species restricted to the Kimberley. Their small size, secretive disposition and variable pelage have hampered field identification, and thus, understanding of their distribution and status. The populations of all three are currently believed to be stable and their status is considered secure. Petrogale rothschildi is known from the Hamersley and Chichester Ranges, the east Pilbara, the Burrup Peninsula and four islands in the Dampier Archipelago. It is abundant on three of these islands, but has declined on Dolphin island. The status of the mainland populations is uncertain. Petrogale lateralis is a diverse species, with two subspecies and two chromosomal races occurring in WA. Petrogale lateralis hacketti is restricted to three islands in the Archipelago of the Recherche. Petrogale lateralis lateralis has declined throughout its mainland range, with extant populations known from six localities in the Wheatbelt; Cape Range; the Calvert Range; and Barrow and Salisbury Islands. It may still be extant in Kalbarri National Park. Petrogale lateralis West Kimberley race has a restricted distribution but appears secure, while P. lateralis MacDonnell Ranges race has declined markedly in recent years. Fox predation has been implicated in the decline of some populations of P. lateralis and P. rothschildi. The impact of factors such as competition from introduced grazers (stock, rabbits, goats), fire and habitat clearing have not been examined. Increased control of exotic predators, taxonomic research to clarify the identity of unsampled populations and field surveys are needed to improve the conservation outlook for WA rock-wallabies.																		0310-0049			BCI:BCI199800046774

Bees on flowers were netted every 14 d for a year, totalling 624 h of sampling. 4086 individuals, representing 192 species and 6 families of Apoidea, visited 140 of the 184 plant species sampled in the area. A mellifera, the second most abundant bee species, was present in a small proportion of the floral sources visited by bees, some of them not primarily melittophilous. Most of the Anthophoridae, Halictidae and Megachilidae exploited plants not visited by A mellifera. Even the Meliponinae, the most similar in morphological and behavioral attributes to Apis mellifera overlapped with Apis on few plant species.																		0044-8435			WOS:A1991GJ88000005

J	ROUBIK D W; MORENO J E; VERGARA C; WITTMANN D								SPORADIC FOOD COMPETITION WITH THE AFRICAN HONEY BEE PROJECTED IMPACT ON NEOTROPICAL SOCIAL BEES								Journal of Tropical Ecology				2	2			97	111						1986	1986	Bee colonies in lowland forest in Panama were monitored for pollen and nectar harvest, pollen species utilization and nectar quality and quantity per returning forager. Despite sharing most pollen resources and nectar of the same quality with 20 introduced colonies of the African honey bee (Apis mellifera), native stingless bees of 12 species were largely unaffected by its activity. Pollen and nectar harvested by the honey bees were 10-200 times that procured by 17 stingless bee colonies. This discrepancy in total harvest and general lack of competitive effect is explained by a honey bee foraging area over 10 times that of the native bees, and apparent foraging shifts to escape competition with honey bees, thus reduced potential overlap in foraging sites. Seven cases of direct resource competition for pollen or nectar were documented, out of 31 tests. Rare periods of intensive harvest were diminished by competing African honey bees. Such harvest peaks lasted for only a few hours in 13 days of observation. Despite averge duration of 4% foraging time for each species, peaks included as much as 51% total harvest. Calculations based upon colony populations, food stores and flight range show that if African honey bees persist at a density of 1 colony per km2, colonies of some stingless bee species may disappear after 10 years. Their chances of escaping food competition by taxonomic specialization on flowers seem slight.																		0266-4674			BCI:BCI198784002869

J	Roubik, DW; Wolda, H								Do competing honey bees matter? Dynamics and abundance of native bees before and after honey bee invasion								POPULATION ECOLOGY				43	1			53	62		10.1007/PL00012016				APR 2001	2001	To provide replicate samples of local bee populations in a nature preserve, Light traps operated continuously on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, collected bees for 17 years, including 10 years following invasion by African Apis mellifera. Honey bees appeared in light traps as the first swarms colonized the Panama Canal area. Their numbers followed seasonal trends shown in independent studies, thus indicating bee abundance and activity in a large area. No measurable population-level impact of competition between this invading honey bee and native bees, despite many demonstrations of resource competition at flower patch and colony levels, changed annual abundances of all 15 native bee species. Native bee abundance did not decrease, nor did native bees show substantial reciprocal yearly change with honey bee abundance. One strong negative correlation of bee catches with an extremely rainy year was found. However, multiple regression using rainfall and honey bee abundance as the independent variables showed that neither was responsible for bee population change over 17 years. Nearly half the native species declined during a year that displayed peak honey bee number. That competition from honey bees on an island the size of BCI was necessarily reduced below impact levels expected on the mainland is discussed using a model of resource and consumer density, foraging range, and island size.																		1438-3896	1438-390X		WOS:000169145300008

J	Schwarz, Michael P.; Hurst, Pamela S.								Effects of introduced honey bees on Australia's native bee fauna								Victorian Naturalist (Blackburn)				114	1			7	12						1997	1997	The introduced Honey Bee, Apis mellifera, has been present in Australia as both a commercially managed and feral species for over 150 years and there is considerable concern that it may have negative impacts on Australian flora and fauna. We briefly describe several aspects of Australia's native bee fauna and then discuss the potential for resource competition between honey bees and native bees. Three factors which may augment the competitive ability of Honey Bees compared to native bees are outlined: the extended foraging periods and seasonal activity of Honey Bees, their ability to rapidly recruit foragers in the exploitation of food sources; and their ability to forage over long distances. However, the few Australian investigations into resource competition between Honey Bees and native bees have been inconclusive. In some cases experimental designs were inadequate, and in all cases, study sites were in areas with relatively rich floral resources. It is proposed that competition for floral resources will be greater in areas of low floristic abundance and that future studies should examine the effects of Honey Bee presence in these areas. In addition, bee species with a restricted range of food resources, such as some short tongued bees, may be more susceptible to competition and therefore warrant investigation. Finally, the problem of controlling feral Honey Bee populations is discussed.																		0042-5184			BCI:BCI199799469760

The grasslands greatly differed in the number of honey bee colonies within a radius of 2 km and were surrounded by agricultural habitats. The number of flower-visiting honey bees on both potted mustard plants and small grassland patches declined with increasing distance from the nearest apiary and was almost zero at a distance of 1.5-2.0 km. Wild bees were observed visiting 57 plant species, whereas honey bees visited only 24 plant species. Percentage resource overlap between honey bees and wild bees was 45.5%, and Hurlbert's index of niche overlap was 3.1. In total, 1849 wild bees from 98 species were recorded on the calcareous grasslands. Neither species richness nor abundance of wild bees were negatively correlated with the density of honey bee colonies (within a radius of 2 km) or the density of flower-visiting honey bees per site. Abundance of flower-visiting wild bees was correlated only with the percentage cover of flowering plants. In 240 trap nests, 1292 bee nests with 6066 brood cells were found. Neither the number of bee species nor the number of brood cells per grassland was significantly correlated with the density of honey bees. Significant correlations were found only between the number of brood cells and the percentage cover of shrubs. The number of nest entrances of ground-nesting bees per square metre was not correlated with the density of honey bees but was negatively correlated with the cover of vegetation. Interspecific competition by honey bees for food resources was not shown to be a significant factor determining abundance and species rich ness of wild bees.																		0029-8549			WOS:000085386700017	28308384

Two classes of colonies were studied: founders, and established colonies. Nests and contents were collected from an experimental site and three control sites following several months of exposure at the experimental site to the apiary honey bee population. Nest contents were analysed for differences among sites in colony population parameters which could have been caused by resource competition with introduced honey bees. Colony founding and overall colony survival were also considered.During the first season, the average number of large larvae plus prepupae per colony was significantly higher in the experimental site than in the control site. This difference could, however, have been the result of a two-week gap in sampling all the sites. All nest parameters showed high variability and there were no other significant differences between the two kinds of site.In the experimental site during the second season there were, relative to the control sites, significantly fewer total numbers of adult males and females in established nests and in all nests combined, significantly more immatures of all stages in founder nests and significantly lower adult male:female ratio. Although preliminary in nature, the data suggest that, in the experimental plots, E. asimillima showed: (i) increased adult emigration, (ii) increased brood rearing success, and/or (iii) relatively later colony founding, compared to the three controls. The possibility of resource competition with honey bees causing the observed changes is discussed, along with alternative explanations.																		0307-692X			WOS:A1991GA22800004

In this article we provide the background and rationale of the argument and present scientific studies which have attempted to provide evidence. We also suggest some approaches to dealing with real issues related to honey bee competition, bee conservation, and honey bee management.																		0005-772X			WOS:A1996UD19600004		
J	THOENES, SC								FATAL ATTRACTION OF CERTAIN LARGE-BODIED NATIVE BEES TO HONEY-BEE COLONIES								JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY				66	2			210	213						APR 1993	1993	Two species of large-bodied native bees (Bombus sonorus and Xylocopa californica) were found to be attracted to honey bee colonies placed in the native bees' local environment. The bumble bees and carpenter bees were attacked en masse by the honey bees and killed. A total of 147 worker bumble bees and 5 female carpenter bees were collected in dead bee traps attached to the front of the honey bee colonies. Thus the presence of honey bee colonies can negatively impact native bee populations by weakening colonies to a vulnerable point or by eliminating potential reproductives.																		0022-8567			WOS:A1993MF53800010

LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING				37	3-4			137	146		10.1016/S0169-2046(97)80000-X				JUL 1997	1997	Increasingly, environmental decision-making is scrutinised with respect to a precautionary principle. This principle asserts that where uncertainty and doubt make it impossible to be sure about a correct decision, any errors should favour the long-term sustainability of the environment.Although there an problems in practical adherence to this principle, it has particular meaning and value for quantitative, ecological aspects of environmental sampling and monitoring. When probabilistic (or statistical) interpretations of data are made, there are two potential errors: Type I, or rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true and Type II, or retaining a null hypothesis when it is wrong. In environmental terms, these can often be translated as Type I error occurring if it is claimed that there is an environmental impact when there is none. A Type II error would represent failing to detect an impact even though one has occurred.Most ecological and environmental work is designed to keep the possibility of Type I error small (and by convention at about one in twenty). Usually, there is little or no concern about Type II errors. The precautionary principle, however, dictates that Type II errors are a serious problem for environmental management-and much more so than Type I errors. Thus, not detecting impacts (Type II) is not precautionary.This paper summarizes the relevant features of environmental monitoring and sampling that decrease the chance of Type II error (and therefore increase the 'power' of a sampling program to detect impacts). Better consideration of these issues in the design of sampling would greatly increase adherence to the precautionary principle and would enhance the prospects of sustainable environmental decision-making.Interpreting precautionary principles in terms of environmental sampling and measurement would increase the need (and potentially the capacity) to define possible environmental disturbances and responses to them in more quantitative and less vague terms.																		0169-2046			WOS:A1997XJ47600001

Increasing concern over the sustainable management of forested landscapes and the extent of forest clearance world-wide has led to a growing interest in the impacts of logging and associated habitat disturbance on biodiversity.2. We conducted an experimental study of the impact of clearfelling on birds of the karri Eucalyptus diversicolor forest in south-west Western Australia over a 17-year period, and a retrospective study of both clearfelled and naturally regenerated karri stands aged from 0 to 146 years.3. One-third of species still had significantly reduced abundance 14 years after disturbance ceased, although all affected species made limited use of regenerating forest.4. Multivariate analysis of changes in bird community structure showed that the effects of disturbance were still evident 14 years after clearfelling. Clearfelling may also have produced some temporary changes in community structure in adjacent unlogged forest.5. Species richness and total abundance of birds declined by 58% and 96%, respectively, in the first year after clearfelling, and 14 years after logging were still 17% and 55% below levels in adjacent undisturbed forest. During this early successional phase both measures increased as a simple function of stand age. Species richness of regrowth reach-od that of old-growth at 30-50, years and total abundance of all bird species in regrowth was similar to that of old-growth after approximately 70 years.6. Several bird species offer potential as indicators of the ecological sustainability of karri forest management. These species nest in large hollows in standing live trees (two cockatoo species) or have been slow to recolonize immature regrowth karri forests (six species).7. Post-hoc power analysis showed that even the long-term and intensive sampling employed in this study failed to detect declines in abundance of less than 80-90% for most bird species. For many uncommon species, trying to estimate changes in abundance is problematic and likely to require replication which is difficult to achieve in field situations where logged and unlogged forests are compared. Despite this, the present study identified some key impacts of forest clearfelling on bird communities, with implications both for the consequences of clearfelling of forests and the criteria for sustainable forest management.																		0021-8901			WOS:000171692900002

The level of naturally occurring variation in populations and communities over space and time will dictate the sampling effort required to detect human-induced changes. We compiled a set of existing surveys of the bee faunas of natural communities from around the world to examine patterns of abundance and richness. We focused on a subset of these studies to illustrate variation in bee communities among different sites and within sites over different spatial and temporal scales. We used examples from our compilation and other published studies to illustrate sampling approaches that maximize the value of future sampling efforts. Existing studies suggest that bee faunas are locally diverse, highly variable in space and time, and often rich in rare species. All of these attributes indicate that intense sampling among sites and years will be required to differentiate changes due to specific impacts from the natural dynamics of populations and communities. Given the limits on time and funding for studying bees, approaches that maximize information for effort must be sought for future studies. Reliable information on population and community changes may be gleaned from examining "functional groups" rather than entire faunas. Regardless of the purpose of the study, standardized sampling protocols using replicated designs will increase the value of data. Standardization permits statistical testing of changes in bee populations and communities, and allows for rigorous comparison between studies.																		1195-5449			WOS:000170221500005

The spectrum of plants used for pollen by the Melipona species was rather restricted. Only five pollen types contributed more than 1% to the total harvest over the year. The most important plant families were Myrtaceae and Melastomataceae, which also provided most of the nectar. The Africanized honey bee mainly used plants of Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae and Arecaceae for pollen and Cunoniaceae, Rubiaceae and Myrtaceae for nectar. Measures of trophic niche overlap indicate the importance of common resource utilization for all three species of eusocial bees. Niche overlap between Melipona bees and A mellifera was more evident for nectar than for pollen. However, the peak in pollen harvest by the colonies of stingless bees as revealed by the number of newly filled storage pots coincided with a low level of presumed competitive pressure of Africanized honey bets, which was calculated as a product of niche overlap and amount of resources harvested. This can be interpreted as indirect evidence of actual competition for food.																		0044-8435			WOS:000071857100002

In this reserve, 17 species of stingless bees and the introduced Africanized honey bee were found, the latter being the most abundant flower visitor. Of all flowering plants, Asteraceae and Myrtaceae were particularly important as resources for bees. Trophic niche overlap between the various species of stingless bees is evident and it was generally larger within the tribes Meliponini and Trigonini than between members of different tribes. Nevertheless, in the stingless bee community the competitive pressure is rather uniformly spread. The trophic niche of the Africanized honey bee can be positioned between those of Meliponini and Trigonini. Today this introduced species represents the main competitor in this bee community. However, its impact on native stingless bee populations is apparently buffered by mass-flowering trees which are the most important food plants of the indigenous highly eusocial bees.																		0165-0521	1744-5140		WOS:A1996XQ38500003
