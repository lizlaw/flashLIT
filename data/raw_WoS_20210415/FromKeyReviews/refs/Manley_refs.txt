J	Baer, B; Schmid-Hempel, P				Baer, Boris/F-5301-2011	Baer, Boris/0000-0002-1136-5967			Experimental variation in polyandry affects parasite loads and fitness in a bumble-bee								NATURE				397	6715			151	154						JAN 14 1999	1999	In many species of animals, females typically mate with more than one male (polyandry). Some social insects carry this behaviour to extremes(1). For example, honeybee queens mate with ten to twenty (car even more) males on their nuptial flights(2). The reasons for this behaviour remain unknown, given the obvious costs of time, energy and exposure to predation. Several potential benefits of polyandry have been proposed(1,3,4), but none are well supported yet. Here we test the hypothesis that genetic diversity among a female's offspring may offer some protection from parasitism(5-7). We artificially inseminated queens of a bumble-bee (Bombus terrestris L.) with sperm of either low or high genetic diversity. The resulting colonies were exposed to parasitism under field conditions. High-diversity colonies had fewer parasites and showed greater reproductive success, on average, than did low-diversity colonies. We suggest that female mating frequency may be influenced in part by parasites.																		0028-0836			WOS:000078085000043

Recent evidence suggests that minimal changes in viral genomes may trigger a shift in receptor usage for virus entry, even into the same cell type. A capacity to exploit alternative entry pathways may reflect the-ancient evolutionary origins of viruses and a possible role as agents of horizontal gene transfers among cells.																		0036-8075			WOS:000168609200042	11352064	
J	Birmingham, AL; Hoover, SE; Winston, ML; Ydenberg, RC								Drifting bumble bee (Hymenoptera : Apidae) workers in commercial greenhouses may be social parasites								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				82	12			1843	1853		10.1139/Z04-181				DEC 2004	2004	Commercial greenhouses require high densities of managed bumble bee (Bombus occidentalis Greene, 1858 and Bombus impatiens Cresson, 1863) colonies to pollinate crops such as tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller). We examined drifting, a behavioural consequence of introducing closely aggregated colonies into greenhouse habitats, to determine possible explanations for observed drifting frequencies. Bee drift is normally associated with increased individual mortality and disease transfer between colonies. In this study, individual bees frequently drifted into and remained within foreign colonies. More drifting bees were found in colonies with higher worker and brood populations and greater pollen stores. Increased intracolony aggressive interactions were not associated with a higher number of drifting bees. Drifting bees had a significantly greater number of mature eggs in their ovaries than did resident worker bees residing in colonies hosting drifters, suggesting that drifting could potentially increase the fitness of individual worker bees and may not be solely a function of disorientation and (or) nectar robbing. Taken together, our results suggest that drifting of workers into foreign colonies within greenhouses may demonstrate a predisposition to social parasitism. This selfish worker reproduction challenges our previous understanding of social insect societies as being cooperative societies.																		0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000227871500002

Seven foraging guilds are defined according to the dietary patterns of hoverflies, reflecting mainly a sequential exploitation of flowers at different times of the year and in different habitats.The majority of species live in forests where they form highly diversified communities. Few Syrphinae colonize successfully open and anthropogenic habitats, such as field margins and fallow areas. Episyrphus balteatus. Melanostoma mellinum, Eupeodes corollae. Sphaerophoria scripta and Plutycheirus spp. are dominant in the communities of Syrphinae from open habitats, all over western Europe. These species are highly polyphagous and characterized by elongated mouthparts as well as a long and slender body. They have access to pollen and nectar in flowers with small and tubular corollae. It is suggested that their polyphagy is an important asset for colonizing open and ephemeral habitats.																		0906-7590	1600-0587		WOS:000166135300010

Fragmentary observations, however, have suggested population declines in several North American species. Despite rising concern over these observations in the United States, highlighted in a recent National Academy of Sciences report, a national assessment of the geographic scope and possible causal factors of bumble bee decline is lacking. Here, we report results of a 3-y interdisciplinary study of changing distributions, population genetic structure, and levels of pathogen infection in bumble bee populations across the United States. We compare current and historical distributions of eight species, compiling a database of >73,000 museum records for comparison with data from intensive nationwide surveys of >16,000 specimens. We show that the relative abundances of four species have declined by up to 96% and that their surveyed geographic ranges have contracted by 23-87%, some within the last 20 y. We also show that declining populations have significantly higher infection levels of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema bombi and lower genetic diversity compared with co-occurring populations of the stable (nondeclining) species. Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are, thus, realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in North America, although cause and effect remain uncertain.																		0027-8424			WOS:000286097700045	21199943

When a colony has a queen (i.e., it is queenright) almost all worker-laid eggs are eaten, but when hopelessly queenless, the workers become more tolerant of worker-laid eggs and rear some of them to adult drones. This increased tolerance renders a queenless colony vulnerable to worker reproductive parasitism, wherein unrelated workers enter the colony and lay eggs. Here, we show that the proportion of unrelated (non-natal) workers significantly decreases after an Apis mellifera colony becomes queenless. The remaining non-natal workers are as likely to have activated ovaries as natal workers, yet they produce more eggs than natal workers, resulting in significantly higher reproductive success for non-natal workers. In a second experiment, we provided queenless and queenright workers with a choice to remain in their own colony or to join a queenless or queenright colony nearby. The experiment was set up such that worker movement was unlikely to be due to simple orientation errors. Very few workers joined another colony, and there was no preference for workers to drift into or out of queenless or queenright colonies, in accordance with the proportion of non-natal workers declining significantly after becoming queenless in the first experiment.																		0340-5443	1432-0762		WOS:000274433500012

To alleviate the threats posed by these invasive organisms, a better understanding of bee viral infections will be of crucial importance in developing effective and environmentally benign disease control strategies. Although knowledge of honey bee viruses has been accumulated considerably in the past three decades, a comprehensive review to compile the various aspects of bee viruses at the molecular level has not been reported. This chapter summarizes recent progress in the understanding of the morphology, genome organization, transmission, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of honey bee viruses as well as their interactions with their honey bee hosts. The future prospects of research of honey bee viruses are also discussed in detail. The chapter has been designed to provide researchers in the field with updated information about honey bee viruses and to serve as a starting point for future research.																		0065-3527		978-0-12-373728-1	WOS:000249814800002	17765703

In general, transmission of viruses can occur through two pathways: horizontal and vertical transmission. In horizontal transmission, viruses are transmitted among individuals of the same generation, while vertical transmission occurs from mothers to their offspring. Because of its highly organized social structure and crowded population density, the honey bee colony represents a risky environment for the spread of disease infection. Like other plant and animal viruses, bee viruses use different survival strategies, including utilization of both horizontal and vertical routes, to transmit and maintain levels in a host population. In this review, we explore the current knowledge about the honey bee viruses and transmission routes of bee viruses. In addition, different transmission strategies on the persistence and dynamics of host pathogen interactions are also discussed.

The virus status of individual queens was evaluated by examining the presence of viruses in the queens' feces and tissues, including hemolymph, gut, ovaries, spermatheca, head, and eviscerated body. Except for head tissue, all five tissues as well as queen feces were found to be positive for virus infections. When queens in bee colonies were identified as positive for BQCV, DWV, CBPV, KBV, and SBV, the same viruses were detected in their offspring, including eggs, larvae, and adult workers. On the other hand, when queens were found positive for only two viruses, BQCV and DWV, only these two viruses were detected in their offspring. The presence of viruses in the tissue of ovaries and the detection of the same viruses in queens' eggs and young larvae suggest vertical transmission of viruses from queens to offspring. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of vertical transmission of viruses in honeybee colonies.																		0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000234662800078	16391097

Plight of the bumble bee: Pathogen spillover from commercial to wild populations								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				129	4			461	467		10.1016/j.biocon.2005.11.013				MAY 2006	2006	Pathogen spread or 'spillover' can occur when heavily infected, domestic hosts interact with closely-related wildlife populations. Commercially-produced bumble bees used in greenhouse pollination often have higher levels of various pathogens than wild bumble bees. These pathogens may spread to wild bees when commercial bees escape from greenhouses and interact with their wild counterparts at nearby flowers. We examined the prevalence of four pathogens in wild bumble bee populations at locations near and distant to commercial greenhouses in southern Ontario, Canada. Bumble bees collected near commercial greenhouses were more frequently infected by those pathogens capable of being transmitted at flowers (Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi) than bees collected at sites away from greenhouses. We argue that the spillover of pathogens from commercial to wild bees is the most likely cause of this pattern and we discuss the implications of such spillover for bumble bee conservation.

CCD has resulted in a loss of 50 to 90% of colonies in beekeeping operations across the United States. The observation that irradiated combs from affected colonies can be repopulated with naive bees suggests that infection may contribute to CCD. We used an unbiased metagenomic approach to survey microflora in CCD hives, normal hives, and imported royal jelly. Candidate pathogens were screened for significance of association with CCD by the examination of samples collected from several sites over a period of 3 years. One organism, Israeli acute paralysis virus of bees, was strongly correlated with CCD.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000250086100050	17823314

An important question therefore is what determines the host range of a pathogen and the community of pathogens found within a given host species. Using primates as a model, we show that infectious diseases are more often shared between species that are closely related and inhabit the same geographical region. We find that host relatedness is the best overall predictor of whether two host species share the same pathogens. A higher frequency of pathogen host shifts between close relatives or inheritance of pathogens from a common ancestor may explain this result. For viruses, geographical overlap among neighbouring primate hosts is more important in determining host range. We suggest this is because rapid evolution within viral lineages allows host jumps across larger evolutionary distances. We also show that the phylogenetic pattern of pathogen sharing with humans is the same as that between wild primates. For humans, this means we share a higher proportion of pathogens with the great apes, including chimpanzees and gorillas, because these species are our closest relatives.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000256387500014	18445561

However, the learning mechanisms behind such information use can allow animals to be flexible in the cues that are used. This raises the question of whether conspecific cues are inherently more influential than cues provided by heterospecifics, or whether animals can simply use any cue that predicts fitness enhancing conditions, including those provided by heterospecifics. To determine how freely social information travels across species boundaries, we trained bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to learn to use cues provided by conspecifics and heterospecific honey bees (Apis mellifera) to locate valuable floral resources. We found that heterospecific demonstrators did not differ from conspecifics in the extent to which they guided observers' choices, whereas various types of inorganic visual cues were consistently less effective than conspecifics. This was also true in a transfer test where bees were confronted with a novel flower type. However, in the transfer test, conspecifics were slightly more effective than heterospecific demonstrators. We then repeated the experiment with entirely naive bees that had never foraged alongside conspecifics before. In this case, heterospecific demonstrators were equally efficient as conspecifics both in the initial learning task and the transfer test. Our findings demonstrate that social learning is not a unique process limited to conspecifics and that through associative learning, interspecifically sourced information can be just as valuable as that provided by conspecific individuals. Furthermore the results of this study highlight potential implications for understanding competition within natural pollinator communities.																		1932-6203			WOS:000302730100072	22347479

Both biotic and abiotic factors are involved in this phenomenon that is often associated with high loads of parasites and pathogens. A stronger impact of pathogens in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticides has been reported, but the causal link between insecticide exposure and the possible immune alteration of honey bees remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin negatively modulates NF-kappa B immune signaling in insects and adversely affects honey bee antiviral defenses controlled by this transcription factor. We have identified in insects a negative modulator of NF-kappa B activation, which is a leucine-rich repeat protein. Exposure to clothianidin, by enhancing the transcription of the gene encoding this inhibitor, reduces immune defenses and promotes the replication of the deformed wing virus in honey bees bearing covert infections. This honey bee immunosuppression is similarly induced by a different neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, but not by the organophosphate chlorpyriphos, which does not affect NF-kappa B signaling. The occurrence at sublethal doses of this insecticide-induced viral proliferation suggests that the studied neonicotinoids might have a negative effect at the field level. Our experiments uncover a further level of regulation of the immune response in insects and set the stage for studies on neural modulation of immunity in animals. Furthermore, this study has implications for the conservation of bees, as it will contribute to the definition of more appropriate guidelines for testing chronic or sublethal effects of pesticides used in agriculture.																		0027-8424			WOS:000326830900045	24145453

Distinctive features of RNA virus replication include high mutation rates, high yields, and short replication times. As a consequence, RNA viruses replicate as complex and dynamic mutant swarms, called viral quasispecies. Mutation rates at defined genomic sites are affected by the nucleotide sequence context on the template molecule as well as by environmental factors. In vitro hypermutation reactions offer a means to explore the functional sequence space of nucleic acids and proteins. The evolution of a viral quasispecies is extremely dependent on the population size of the virus that is involved in the infections. Repeated bottleneck events lead to average fitness losses, with viruses that harbor unusual, deleterious mutations. In contrast, large population passages result in rapid fitness gains, much larger than those so far scored for cellular organisms. Fitness gains in one environment often lead to fitness losses in an alternative environment. An important challenge in RNA virus evolution research is the assignment of phenotypic traits to specific mutations. Different constellations of mutations may be associated with a similar biological behavior. In addition, recent evidence suggests the existence of critical thresholds for the expression of phenotypic traits. Epidemiological as well as functional and structural studies suggest that RNA viruses can tolerate restricted types and numbers of mutations during any specific time point during their evolution. Viruses occupy only a tiny portion of their potential sequence space. Such limited tolerance to mutations may open new avenues for combating viral infections.																		0066-4227			WOS:A1997YA46700007	9343347

But aside from providing rewards, flowers can be risky places to visit, for example if a predator ambushes during the feeding/pollination process. Here, we show that pollination may also involve the transmission of pathogens for the pollinators. Experimental evidence is given that a trypanosome parasite, Crithidia bombi, can be horizontally transmitted within populations of its hosts, the bumblebees Bombus spp., through the shared use of flowers. Important floral characteristics such as nectar availability or inflorescence architecture may also affect transmission rate. Therefore, in addition to energetic considerations, pollinator strategies could also be governed by the risk of contracting pathogens.																		0962-8452			WOS:A1994QB14000013

Here, we develop a simple stochastic model as a first attempt to understand these 'incidence dynamics'. Based on the empirically supported assumption that the probability of successful transmission from an infected to a new host species declines with increasing genetic distance between them, we study the impact of different phylogenetic histories of the host clade on the pattern of spread and the average incidence of the parasites. Our results suggest that host phylogeny alone can lead to heterogeneous parasite incidence.																		0269-7653	1573-8477		WOS:000241791700008

Parasites are known to be an important factor in the some of the population declines of honey bees and bumblebees, but little is known about the parasites afflicting most other pollinators, or the extent of interspecific transmission or vectoring of parasites. Here we carry out a preliminary screening of pollinators (honey bees, five species of bumblebee, three species of wasp, four species of hoverfly and three genera of other bees) in the UK for parasites. We used molecular methods to screen for six honey bee viruses, Ascosphaera fungi, Microsporidia, and Wolbachia intracellular bacteria. We aimed simply to detect the presence of the parasites, encompassing vectoring as well as actual infections. Many pollinators of all types were positive for Ascosphaera fungi, while Microsporidia were rarer, being most frequently found in bumblebees. We also detected that most pollinators were positive for Wolbachia, most probably indicating infection with this intracellular symbiont, and raising the possibility that it may be an important factor in influencing host sex ratios or fitness in a diversity of pollinators. Importantly, we found that about a third of bumblebees (Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris) and a third of wasps (Vespula vulgaris), as well as all honey bees, were positive for deformed wing virus, but that this virus was not present in other pollinators. Deformed wing virus therefore does not appear to be a general parasite of pollinators, but does interact significantly with at least three species of bumblebee and wasp. Further work is needed to establish the identity of some of the parasites, their spatiotemporal variation, and whether they are infecting the various pollinator species or being vectored. However, these results provide a first insight into the diversity, and potential exchange, of parasites in pollinator communities.																		1932-6203			WOS:000301703800022	22347356

Due to this life history trait, bumblebees are more susceptible to parasites and diseases than polyandrous and/or polygynous social insects. A greater resistance towards parasites is shown when the genetic variability within a colony is increased. The parasite resistance may be divided into different levels regarding the step of the parasite infection (e. g. parasite uptake, parasite intake, parasite's establishment in the nest, parasite transmission). We investigate the prophylactic behaviour of bumblebees. Bumblebees were observed during their foraging flights on two artificial flowers; one of these was contaminated by Crithidia bombi, a naturally occurring gut parasite of bumblebees (in a control experiment the non-specific pathogen Escherichia coli was used). For C. bombi, bumblebees were preferentially observed feeding on the non-contaminated flower. Whereas for E. coli, the number of visits between flowers was the same, bumblebees spent more time feeding on the non-contaminated flower. These results demonstrate the ability of bumblebees to recognise the contamination of food sources. In addition, bumblebees have a stronger preference for the non-contaminated flower when C. bombi is present in the other flower than with E. coli which might be explained as an adaptive behaviour of bumblebees towards this specific gut parasite. It seems that the more specific the parasite is, the more it reduces the reward of the flower.																		1932-6203			WOS:000296515200011	22039462

Honeybees (Apis mellifera), the prevailing managed insect crop pollinator, suffer from a range of emerging and exotic high-impact pathogens(3,4), and population maintenance requires active management by beekeepers to control them. Wild pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline(5,6), one cause of which may be pathogen spillover from managed pollinators like honeybees(7,8) or commercial colonies of bumblebees(9). Here we use a combination of infection experiments and landscape-scale field data to show that honeybee EIDs are indeed widespread infectious agents within the pollinator assemblage. The prevalence of deformed wing virus (DWV) and the exotic parasite Nosema ceranae in honeybees and bumblebees is linked; as honeybees have higher DWV prevalence, and sympatric bumblebees and honeybees are infected by the same DWV strains, Apis is the likely source of at least one major EID in wild pollinators. Lessons learned from vertebrates(10,11) highlight the need for increased pathogen control in managed bee species to maintain wild pollinators, as declines in native pollinators may be caused by interspecies pathogen transmission originating from managed pollinators.																		0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000331477800040	24553241

We assessed these consequences by measuring 1) the contribution of insect pollination to the world agricultural output economic value, and 2) the vulnerability of world agriculture in the face of pollinator decline. We used a bioeconomic approach, which integrated the production dependence ratio on pollinators, for the 100 crops used directly for human food worldwide as listed by FAO. The total economic value of pollination worldwide amounted to (sic)153 billion, which represented 9.5% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. In terms of welfare, the consumer surplus loss was estimated between (sic)190 and (sic)310 billion based upon average price elasticities of - 1.5 to - 0.8, respectively. Vegetables and fruits were the leading crop categories in value of insect pollination with about (sic)50 billion each, followed by edible oil crops, stimulants, nuts and spices. The production value of a ton of the crop categories that do not depend on insect pollination averaged (sic)151 while that of those that are pollinator-dependent averaged (sic)761. The vulnerability ratio was calculated for each crop category at the regional and world scales as the ratio between the economic value of pollination and the current total crop value. This ratio varied considerably among crop categories and there was a positive correlation between the rate of vulnerability to pollinators decline of a crop category and its value per production unit. Looking at the capacity to nourish the world population after pollinator loss, the production of 3 crop categories - namely fruits, vegetables, and stimulants - will clearly be below the current consumption level at the world scale and even more so for certain regions like Europe. Yet, although our valuation clearly demonstrates the economic importance of insect pollinators, it cannot be considered as a scenario since it does not take into account the strategic responses of the markets.

Whether such declines reduce crop yields, or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey bees, is unclear. We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower visitation by wild insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast, fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation by honey bees in only 14% of the systems surveyed. Overall, wild insects pollinated crops more effectively; an increase in wild insect visitation enhanced fruit set by twice as much as an equivalent increase in honey bee visitation. Visitation by wild insects and honey bees promoted fruit set independently, so pollination by managed honey bees supplemented, rather than substituted for, pollination by wild insects. Our results suggest that new practices for integrated management of both honey bees and diverse wild insect assemblages will enhance global crop yields.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000316731600049	23449997

Hence, they are vital for an economic, sustainable agriculture and for food security. In addition, honey bees also pollinate a variety of wild flowers and, therefore, contribute to the biodiversity of many ecosystems. Honey and other hive products are, at least economically and ecologically rather, by-products of beekeeping. Due to this outstanding role of honey bees, severe and inexplicable honey bee colony losses, which have been reported recently to be steadily increasing, have attracted much attention and stimulated many research activities. Although the phenomenon "decline of honey bees" is far from being finally solved, consensus exists that pests and pathogens are the single most important cause of otherwise inexplicable colony losses. This review will focus on selected bee pathogens and parasites which have been demonstrated to be involved in colony losses in different regions of the world and which, therefore, are considered current threats to honey bees and beekeeping.																		0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000277784100009	20401479

We also investigated mite infestation in commercial colonies of a Japanese native species, B. ignitus, which are mass-produced in the Netherlands and reimported into Japan. We detected the mite in both natural and commercial colonies of the Japanese species. Comparison of 555 bp sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I (CO1) gene from the mite showed that there were seven haplotypes, on the basis of combinations of substitutions at eight sites in the gene. The haplotypes of the mites in the Japanese native bumblebees and the haplotypes of the mites in B. terrestris did not overlap; however, mtDNA of mites detected in the commercial colonies of B. ignitus possessed the same sequence as a European haplotype. These results indicate that transportation of bumblebee colonies will cause overseas migration of parasitic mites of different origins.																		0962-1083			WOS:000170667500023	11555253

Biosecurity measures to prevent the incursion of invasive alien species into Japan and to mitigate their impact								REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				29	2			299	310		10.20506/rst.29.2.1982				AUG 2010	2010	The 2004 Japanese 'Invasive Alien Species Act' was enacted to control invasive alien species and prevent the damage that they cause to ecosystems. The Act defines invasive alien species as those recognised as, or suspected of, causing damage to ecosystems, human safety, agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Invasive alien species are carefully regulated: raising, planting, keeping or transporting them is prohibited without the express permission of the relevant minister. The Act represents a revolutionary advance for biological conservation in Japan. However, enforcing the Act is problematic. Dealing with the European bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), for example, involved resolving a bitter dilemma between biological conservation and agricultural productivity. The Act also has a serious loophole; it does not include alien micro-organisms. The incursion of amphibian chytridiomycosis into Japan caused confusion for scientists and the Japanese Government because control of such an alien micro-organism was not anticipated in the Act. Japan faces particular difficulties in attempting to control alien species because of its reliance on imports.																		0253-1933			WOS:000281488600009	20919584

We also investigated mite infestation in commercial colonies of the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, imported from the Netherlands and Belgium, and the Japanese native species, B. ignitus, imported from the Netherlands, between 1997 and 2001. We detected mites in natural populations of the two B. hypocrita subspecies and in the commercial colonies. Analysis of variations in 535 bp sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene showed that the mite haplotypes in the native populations and in the imported colonies did not overlap in 1997-1999, but in 2000-2001 some mites possessing European CO1 haplotypes were detected in the natural populations of Japanese native bumblebees. In addition, many mites possessing Japanese haplotypes were detected in the imported commercial colonies from Europe. Considering the fact that the Japanese native bumblebees, B. hypocrita, were once exported to Europe for commercialization, these results suggest that bumblebee commercialization has caused overseas migration and cross-infestation of parasitic mites among natural and commercial colonies. However, because the Japanese and European CO1 haplotypes were closely related, there was a possibility that the European haplotypes found in the mites in the Hokkaido Island revealed native variation. To clarify the status of mite invasion, further detailed analysis of genetic variation of the mite, using other genetic markers on additional samples, need to be performed.					22nd Symposium of the Society-of-Population-Ecology22nd Symposium of the Society-of-Population-Ecology	OCT 28-30, 2005OCT 28-30, 2005	Soc Populat EcolSoc Populat Ecol	Ishikawa, JAPANIshikawa, JAPAN										1438-3896			WOS:000241451500005

This is commonly attributed to the decline in floral resources that has resulted from an intensification in farming practices. Here we assess growth of nests of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, in habitats providing different levels of floral resources. Experimental nests were placed out in conventional farmland, in farmland with flower-rich conservation measures and in suburban areas. Nests gained weight more quickly and attained a larger final size in suburban areas compared to elsewhere. The diversity of pollens gathered by bees was highest in suburban areas, and lowest in conventional farmland. Nests in suburban areas were also more prone to attack by the specialist bumblebee parasite Aphomia sociella, suggesting that this moth is more abundant in suburban areas than elsewhere. Overall, our results demonstrate that gardens provide a greater density and diversity of floral resources than farmland, and probably support larger populations of B. terrestris. Contrary to expectation, schemes deployed to enhance farmland biodiversity appear to have little measurable impact on nest growth of this bumblebee species. We argue that B. terrestris probably forage over a larger scale than that on which farms are managed, so that nest growth is determined by the management of a large number of neighbouring farms, 7 not just that in which the nest is located.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000173912100013	28547150

After importation, they interact with other pollinators, with an associated risk of any parasites they carry infecting and harming native bees. National and supranational regulations are designed to prevent this, and commercially produced bumblebee colonies are accordingly now often sold and imported as being parasite-free. Here, we used molecular methods to examine the occurrence of parasites in bumblebee colonies that were commercially produced in 2011 and 2012 by three producers. We then used controlled experiments to determine whether any parasites present were infectious. We found that 77% of the commercially produced bumblebee colonies from the three producers, which were imported on the basis of being free of parasites, in fact carried microbial parasites, with five different parasites being detected across the total sample of bumblebees and a further three in the pollen supplied with the colonies as food. Our controlled experiments demonstrated that at least three of these parasites were infectious to bumblebees with significant negative effects on their health. Furthermore, we also found that at least four of the parasites carried by commercially produced bumblebees were infectious to honeybees, indicating that they pose a risk to other pollinators as well.Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrate that commercially produced bumblebee colonies carry multiple, infectious parasites that pose a significant risk to other native and managed pollinators. More effective disease detection and management strategies are urgently needed to reduce the pathogen spillover threat from commercially produced bumblebees.The results demonstrate that commercially produced bumblebee colonies carry multiple, infectious parasites that pose a significant risk to other native and managed pollinators.

In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5% are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, wind-pollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000243354100001	17164193

Parasites are likely contributing to this phenomenon. A distinct resident community of bacteria has recently been identified in bumble bees and honey bees that is not shared with related solitary bee species. We now show that the presence of these microbiota protects bee hosts against a widespread and highly virulent natural parasite (Crithidia bombi) in an experimental setting. We add further support to this antagonistic relationship from patterns found in field data. For the successful establishment of these microbiota and a protective effect, exposure to feces from nest mates was needed after pupal eclosion. Transmission of beneficial gut bacteria could therefore represent an important benefit of sociality. Our results stress the importance of considering the host microbiota as an "extended immune phenotype" in addition to the host immune system itself and provide a unique perspective to understanding bees in health and disease.																		0027-8424			WOS:000297463100042	22084077

Here we quantify queen dispersal in two common bumblebee species in an arable landscape. Dispersal was measured by taking DNA samples from workers in the spring and summer, and from queens in the following spring, at 14 sites across a landscape. The queens captured in the spring must be full sisters of workers that were foraging in the previous year. A range of sibship reconstruction methods were compared using simulated data sets including or no genotyping errors. The program Colony gave the most accurate reconstruction and was used for our analysis of queen dispersal. Comparison of queen dispersion with worker foraging distances was used to take into account an expected low level of false identification of sister pairs which might otherwise lead to overestimates of dispersal. Our data show that Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius queens can disperse by at least 3 and 5 km, respectively. These estimates are consistent with inferences drawn from studies of population structuring in common and rare bumblebee species, and suggest that regular gene flow over several kilometres due to queen dispersal are likely to be sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion of ubiquitous species over large spatial scales whereas rare bumblebee species appear unable to regularly disperse over distances greater than 10 km. Our results have clear implications for conservation strategies for this important pollinator group, particularly when attempting to conserve fragmented populations.																		0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000273953400017	20089127

That some of these viruses are also found in the broader pollinator community suggests the wider environmental spread of these viruses, with the potential for a broader impact on ecosystems. Studies on the ecology and evolution of these viruses in the arthropod community as a whole may therefore provide important insights into these potential impacts. We examined managed A. mellifera colonies, nearby non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators, and other associated arthropods for the presence of five commonly occurring picorna-like RNA viruses of honey bees - black queen cell virus, deformed wing virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus, Kashmir bee virus and sacbrood virus. Notably, we observed their presence in several arthropod species. Additionally, detection of negative-strand RNA using strand-specific RT-PCR assays for deformed wing virus and Israeli acute paralysis virus suggests active replication of deformed wing virus in at least six non-Apis species and active replication of Israeli acute paralysis virus in one non-Apis species. Phylogenetic analysis of deformed wing virus also revealed that this virus is freely disseminating across the species sampled in this study. In sum, our study indicates that these viruses are not specific to the pollinator community and that other arthropod species have the potential to be involved in disease transmission in pollinator populations.

We conducted a nationwide survey to determine the occurrence and prevalence of pathogens and parasites in Asian honeybees, Apis cerana, in China. Our study provides evidence of infections of A. cerana by pathogenic Deformed wing virus (DWV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Nosema ceranae, and C. bombi species that have been linked to population declines of European honeybees, A. mellifera, and bumble bees. However, the prevalence of DWV, a virus that causes widespread infection in A. mellifera, was low, arguably a result of the greater ability of A. cerana to resist the ectoprasitic mite Varroa destructor, an efficient vector of DWV. Analyses of microbial communities from the A. cerana digestive tract showed that Nosema infection could have detrimental effects on the gut microbiota. Workers infected by N. ceranae tended to have lower bacterial quantities, with these differences being significant for the Bifidobacterium and Pasteurellaceae bacteria groups. The results of this nationwide screen show that parasites and pathogens that have caused serious problems in European honeybees can be found in native honeybee species kept in Asia. Environmental changes due to new agricultural practices and globalization may facilitate the spread of pathogens into new geographic areas. The foraging behavior of pollinators that are in close geographic proximity likely have played an important role in spreading of parasites and pathogens over to new hosts. Phylogenetic analyses provide insights into the movement and population structure of these parasites, suggesting a bidirectional flow of parasites among pollinators. The presence of these parasites and pathogens may have considerable implications for an observed population decline of Asian honeybees.																		1932-6203			WOS:000311935800030	23144838

However, the factors that determine whether a pathogen can infect a novel host are poorly understood. We have examined the ability of three host-specific RNA-viruses (Drosophila sigma viruses from the family Rhabdoviridae) to persist and replicate in 51 different species of Drosophilidae. Using a novel analytical approach we found that the host phylogeny could explain most of the variation in viral replication and persistence between different host species. This effect is partly driven by viruses reaching a higher titre in those novel hosts most closely related to the original host. However, there is also a strong effect of host phylogeny that is independent of the distance from the original host, with viral titres being similar in groups of related hosts. Most of this effect could be explained by variation in general susceptibility to all three sigma viruses, as there is a strong phylogenetic correlation in the titres of the three viruses. These results suggest that the source of new emerging diseases may often be predictable from the host phylogeny, but that the effect may be more complex than simply causing most host shifts to occur between closely related hosts.																		1553-7366	1553-7374		WOS:000295409000060	21966271

In some eusocial Hymenoptera ( ants, bees and wasps), workers can produce male offspring from unfertilized eggs(4). Kin selection theory predicts levels of worker reproduction as a function of the relatedness structure of the workers' natal colony and the colony-level costs of worker reproduction(5,6). However, the theory has been only partially successful in explaining levels of worker reproduction(7-9). Here we show that workers of a eusocial bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) enter unrelated, conspecific colonies in which they then produce adult male offspring, and that such socially parasitic workers reproduce earlier and are significantly more reproductive and aggressive than resident workers that reproduce within their own colonies. Explaining levels of worker reproduction, and hence the potential of worker selfishness to undermine the evolution of cooperation, will therefore require more than simply a consideration of the kin-selected interests of resident workers. It will also require knowledge of the full set of reproductive options available to workers, including intraspecific social parasitism.																		0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000222946100047	15282605

The ecto-parasitic mite Varroa destructor is a serious world-wide pest of the honeybee Apis mellifera and has being linked with the death of millions of colonies, although its role in colony death has remained elusive.2. A simulation model was developed to explain the link between the mite and collapse of the host bee colony, given that colony death does not always occur. We investigated the effects of two pathogens, deformed wing virus (DWV) and acute paralysis virus (APV), vectored by the mite, on the host colony.3. Two previously published simulation models, a bee and a mite, were combined and adapted for use in temperate climates with a variety of bee diseases. The model was constructed using Modelmaker(R) software, which allows the progression of a disease in the host colony to be followed daily.4. The population dynamics generated by the model were similar to those observed in a natural honeybee colony. When DWV- or APV-transmitting mites were introduced into the colony, its adult worker bee population collapsed either during winter or spring for DWV, or autumn to spring for APV. This corresponds well with field observations of colony death in Europe.5. The model revealed that MW initially had little effect on the colony but during late summer, as the population of DAW-transmitting mites increased, the virus caused a reduction in the number of healthy young bees entering the overwintering population. This imbalance in the age structure of the overwintering bees resulted in the eventual death of the colony during the winter or spring. As few as 2000-3600 mites irt autumn could kill a colony.6. In contrast, APV transmitted by Varroa was only able to kill the honeybee colony if a large. (10000+) mite population was already present when an overt APV infection occurred. It was difficult for APV to become established within the bee population due to it causing rapid host death.7. The model predicts that the less virulent DWV will become more widely established than the highly virulent APV, and that mite control measures need to be taken prior to the production of overwintering bees.																		0021-8901			WOS:000171692900016

Unfortunately, where and when an emerging disease will appear are almost impossible to predict. The arrival of the parasitic Varroa mite into the Hawaiian honey bee population allowed us to investigate changes in the prevalence, load, and strain diversity of honey bee viruses. The mite increased the prevalence of a single viral species, deformed wing virus (DWV), from similar to 10 to 100% within honey bee populations, which was accompanied by a millionfold increase in viral titer and a massive reduction in DWV diversity, leading to the predominance of a single DWV strain. Therefore, the global spread of Varroa has selected DWV variants that have emerged to allow it to become one of the most widely distributed and contagious insect viruses on the planet.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000304905300046	22679096

Despite the ecological and economic importance of pathogens deposited in flowers, we often lack a basic understanding of how floral traits influence disease transmission. Here, we provide the first systematic review regarding how floral traits attract vectors (for plant pathogens) or hosts (for animal pathogens), mediate disease establishment and evolve under complex interactions with plant mutualists that can be vectors for microbial antagonists. Attraction of floral visitors is influenced by numerous phenological, morphological and chemical traits, and several plant pathogens manipulate floral traits to attract vectors. There is rapidly growing interest in how floral secondary compounds and antimicrobial enzymes influence disease establishment in plant hosts. Similarly, new research suggests that consumption of floral secondary compounds can reduce pathogen loads in animal pollinators. Given recent concerns about pollinator declines caused in part by pathogens, the role of floral traits in mediating pathogen transmission is a key area for further research. We conclude by discussing important implications of floral transmission of pathogens for agriculture, conservation and human health, suggesting promising avenues for future research in both basic and applied biology.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000333568600012	24528408

Numerous mechanisms could be behind this decline, and the spread of parasites from commercial colonies into wild populations has been implicated recently in North America. Commercial breeding may lead to declines because commercial colonies may have high parasite loads, which can lead to colonization of native bumble bee populations; commercial rearing may allow higher parasite virulence to evolve; and global movement of commercial colonies may disrupt spatial patterns in local adaptation between hosts and parasites. We assessed parasite virulence, transmission mode, and infectivity. Microparasites and so-called honey bee viruses may pose the greatest threat to native bumble bee populations because certain risk factors are present; for example, the probability of horizontal transmission of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi is high. The microsporidian parasite Nosema bombi may play a role in declines of bumble bees in the United States. Preliminary indications that C. bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi may not be native in parts of South America. We suggest that the development of molecular screening protocols, thorough sanitation efforts, and cooperation among nongovernmental organizations, governments, and commercial breeders might immediately mitigate these threats.																		0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000292907500002	21771075

They are infamous for their high mortality after injection in honeybees. These viruses have also been reported in non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators such as bumblebees, which got infected with IAPV when placed in the same greenhouse with IAPV infected honeybee hives. Here we orally infected Bombus terrestris workers with different doses of either IAPV or KBV viral particles. The success of the infection was established by analysis of the bumblebees after the impact studies: 50 days after infection. Doses of 0.5 x 10(7) and 1 x 10(7) virus particles per bee were infectious over this period, for IAPV and KBV respectively, while a dose of 0.5 x 10(6) IAPV particles per bee was not infectious. The impact of virus infection was studied in micro-colonies consisting of 5 bumblebees, one of which becomes a pseudo-queen which proceeds to lay unfertilized (drone) eggs. The impact parameters studied were: the establishment of a laying pseudo-queen, the timing of egg-laying, the number of drones produced, the weight of these drones and worker mortality. In this setup KBV infection resulted in a significant slower colony startup and offspring production, while only the latter can be reported for IAPV. Neither virus increased worker mortality, at the oral doses used. We recommend further studies on how these viruses transmit between different pollinator species. It is also vital to understand how viral prevalence can affect wild bee populations because disturbance of the natural host-virus association may deteriorate the already critically endangered status of many bumblebee species.

Ironically, the cost of using immune defenses could itself reduce host' fitness. This indirect cost of parasitism is often not visible because of compensatory resource intake. Here, workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, were challenged with Lipopolysaccharides and micro-latex beads to induce their immune system under starvation (i.e., not allowing compensatory intake). Compared with controls, survival of induced workers was significantly reduced (by 50 to 70%).																		0036-8075			WOS:000165228200049	11073456

In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels. Almost all comb and foundation wax samples (98%) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, with an average of 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39. There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3.1 ppm).Conclusions/Significance: The 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in mixtures up to 214 ppm in bee pollen alone represents a remarkably high level for toxicants in the brood and adult food of this primary pollinator. This represents over half of the maximum individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. While exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined.																		1932-6203			WOS:000275809700007	20333298

Recent studies from North America suggest that disease transmission from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked range contractions in some species. In Europe, data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the EU since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland. Commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen, depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi, compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2 km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and pathogen-specific manner up to 10 km. We suggest implementing measures that prevent the interaction of commercially reared and wild bumble bees by integrating the enforcement of national best management practices for users of commercial pollinators with international legislation that regulates the sanitation of commercial hives in production facilities.

FMDV clone C-S8c1 was adapted to the guinea pig by serial passage in the animals until secondary lesions were observed. Analysis of the virus directly recovered from the lesions developed by the animals revealed the selection of variants,vith two amino acid substitutions in nonstructural proteins, I-248-->T in 2C and Q(44)-->R in 3A. On further passages, an additional mutation, L-147-->P, was selected in an important antigenic site located in the G-H loop of capsid protein VP1. The amino acid substitution Q(44)-->R in 3A, either alone or in combination,vith the replacement I-248-->T in 2C, was sufficient to give FMDV the ability to produce lesions. This was shown by using infectious transcripts which generated chimeric viruses,vith the relevant amino acid substitutions. Clinical symptoms produced by the artificial chimeras were similar to those produced by the naturally adapted virus. These results obtained with FMDV imply that one or very few replacements in nonstructural viral proteins, which should be within reach of the mutant spectra of replicating viral quasispecies, may result in adaptation of a virus to a new animal host.																		0022-538X	1098-5514		WOS:000167677800049	11264387

This study aimed to quantify the occurrence of natal-worker reproduction, worker drift and drifter reproduction within 14 wild colonies of Bombus terrestris in Central Scotland. Four unlinked microsatellites were used to identify patterns of relatedness of the colonies' adults and broods. In colonies with queens (queenright colonies), worker reproduction accounted for just 0.83 % of males, increasing to 12.11 % in queenless colonies. Four colonies contained a total of six workers which were not daughters of the queen, and were assumed to be drifters, and four male offspring of drifters. Drifting is clearly not common and results in few drifter offspring overall, although drifters produced approximately seven times more offspring per capita than workers that remained in their natal colony. Unexpectedly, two colonies contained clusters of sister workers and juvenile offspring that were not sisters to the rest of the adults or brood found in the colonies, demonstrating probable egg dumping by queens. A third colony contained a queen which was not a sister or daughter to the other bees in the colony. Although usurping of bumblebee colonies by queens in early season is well documented, this appears to be the first record of egg dumping, and it remains unclear whether it is being carried out by old queens or newly mated young queens.																		0340-5443	1432-0762		WOS:000316118400010

The recent switch in host from A. cerana to the western honeybee, Apis mellifera, offers an exceptional opportunity for studying preadaptation and host-parasite relations. The fact that this host shift appears to have happened on at least two separate occasions, with differing outcomes, must be unique. At another level, the rapacious spread of this mite throughout the world is testimony to the ineffectiveness of international quarantine laws.																		0169-5347			WOS:000081381400007	10407428	
J	Otterstatter, Michael C.; Thomson, James D.								Does Pathogen Spillover from Commercially Reared Bumble Bees Threaten Wild Pollinators?								PLOS ONE				3	7					e2771	10.1371/journal.pone.0002771				JUL 23 2008	2008	The conservation of insect pollinators is drawing attention because of reported declines in bee species and the 'ecosystem services' they provide. This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called, 'Colony Collapse Disorder'); yet, we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen 'spillover' from commercially reared bumble bees, which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops, is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and, using laboratory experiments and the literature, estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi, a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover, and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that, during the first three months of spillover, transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However, a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly, infecting up to 35-100% of wild Bombus, and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk. In the field, although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection, the prevalences of C. bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model. Indeed, we found that spillover has allowed C. bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses. Given the available evidence, it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild Bombus in North America. Improved management of domestic bees, for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners, could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover.																		1932-6203			WOS:000264302900041	18648661

Nosema bombi is a microsporidian parasite of bumblebees that is of potentially great ecological and economic importance. Nosema bombi has been shown to have detrimental fitness effects on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The present study investigates whether N. bombi also has negative fitness effects under natural conditions.2. A field experiment was conducted with B. terrestris spring queens caught from the wild. In the laboratory these queens were assigned to either infected or control treatment groups. On the emergence of workers, colonies were placed in the field and a number of fitness and life-history traits were measured.3. The size of colonies produced by infected queens was significantly smaller than those of control queens. None of the 14 infected colonies produced sexual offspring, whereas four of the 14 control colonies reached the male production stage. Results of the field experiment are in agreement with prior laboratory-based results, and even imply that such effects are amplified under natural conditions.4. The evidence suggests that, on entering the colony early, N. bombi has a highly detrimental effect on the fitness of its host. It would seem that this parasite reduces its opportunities to transmit into the next host generation.																		0307-6946	1365-2311		WOS:000259147700003		
J	Perlman, SJ; Jaenike, J								Infection success in novel hosts: An experimental and phylogenetic study of Drosophila-parasitic nematodes								EVOLUTION				57	3			544	557						MAR 2003	2003	Surprisingly little is known about what determines a parasite's host range, which is essential in enabling us to predict the fate of novel infections. In this study, we evaluate the importance of both host and parasite phylogeny in determining the ability of parasites to infect novel host species. Using experimental lab assays, we infected 24 taxonomically diverse species of Drosophila flies (Diptera: Drosophilidae) with five different nematode species (Tylenchida: Allantonematidae: Howardula, Parasitylenchus), and measured parasite infection success, growth, and effects on female host fecundity (i.e., virulence). These nematodes are obligate parasites of mushroom-feeding Drosophila, particularly quinaria and testacea group species, often with severe fitness consequences on their hosts. We show that the potential host ranges of the nematodes are much larger than their actual ranges, even for parasites with only one known host species in nature. Novel hosts that are distantly related from the native host are much less likely to be infected, but among more closely related hosts, there is much variation in susceptibility. Potential host ranges differ greatly between the related parasite species. All nematode species that successfully infected novel hosts produced infective juveniles in these hosts. Most novel infections did not result in significant reductions in the fecundity of female hosts, with one exception: the host specialist Parasitylenchus nearcticus sterilized all quinaria group hosts, only one of which is a host in nature. The large potential host ranges of these parasites, in combination with the high potential for host colonization due to shared mushroom breeding sites, explain the widespread host switching observed in comparisons of nematode and Drosophila phylogenies.																		0014-3820			WOS:000182193800010	12703944

B. terrestris has recently entered into the northwestern Patagonia region of Argentina from Chile. where it was introduced in 1998. Prevalence was 21.6% for C bombi and 3.6% for A. bombi (n = 111). The pathogens were not detected in 441 humble bees belonging to five of the eight known Argentine native species (Bombus atratus, Bombus morio, Bombus bellicosus, Bombus opifex, Bombus tucumanus) collected elsewhere in the Country. Although the absence of natural occurrence of C bombi and A. bombi in Argentine native humble bees cannot be ascertained at present due to the limited surveys performed, it is important to report their detection in invasive B. terrestris. The invasion event is relatively recent and the accompanying pathogens are not species specific within the genus Bombus. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Aquaculture radically alters the ecology of fish and their pathogens. Here we show an increase in the occurrence of the bacterial fish disease Flavobacterium columnare in salmon fingerlings at a fish farm in northern Finland over 23 years. We hypothesize that this emergence was owing to evolutionary changes in bacterial virulence. We base this argument on several observations. First, the emergence was associated with increased severity of symptoms. Second, F. columnare strains vary in virulence, with more lethal strains inducing more severe symptoms prior to death. Third, more virulent strains have greater infectivity, higher tissue-degrading capacity and higher growth rates. Fourth, pathogen strains co-occur, so that strains compete. Fifth, F. columnare can transmit efficiently from dead fish, and maintain infectivity in sterilized water for months, strongly reducing the fitness cost of host death likely experienced by the pathogen in nature. Moreover, this saprophytic infectiousness means that chemotherapy strongly select for strains that rapidly kill their hosts: dead fish remain infectious; treated fish do not. Finally, high stocking densities of homogeneous subsets of fish greatly enhance transmission opportunities. We suggest that fish farms provide an environment that promotes the circulation of more virulent strains of F. columnare. This effect is intensified by the recent increases in summer water temperature. More generally, we predict that intensive fish farming will lead to the evolution of more virulent pathogens.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000273459600011	19864284

The aim of this study was to assess the presence of infectious chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) in bee excreta and evaluate its possible role as an indirect route of infection. Samples of paralyzed bees were (i) produced by experimental inoculation with purified virus and (ii) collected from hives exhibiting chronic paralysis. CBPV in bee heads or feces (crude or absorbed onto paper) was detected by reverse transcription-PCR. CBPV infectivity was assessed by intrathoracic inoculation of bees with virus extracted from feces and by placement of naive bees in cages previously occupied by contaminated individuals. CBPV RNA was systematically detected in the feces of naturally and experimentally infected bees and on the paper sheets that had been used to cover the floors of units containing bees artificially infected with CBPV or the floor of one naturally infected colony. Both intrathoracic inoculation of bees with virus extracted from feces and placement of bees in contaminated cages provoked overt disease in naive bees, thereby proving that the excreted virus was infectious and that this indirect route of infection could lead to overt chronic paralysis. This is the first experimental confirmation that infectious CBPV particles excreted in the feces of infected bees can infect naive bees and provoke overt disease by mere confinement of naive bees in a soiled environment.																		0099-2240			WOS:000251474400027	17933946

While most studies of virulence have involved single-species host-parasite interactions, the majority of parasites are likely to use multiple concurrent host species. Our understanding of how this impacts on parasite epidemiology and virulence is limited. Using the bumble bee Bombus lucorum, which exists in sympatry with B. terrestris in multi-species assemblages, and their generalist micosporidian parasite Nosema bombi, we tested whether the apparent paradox of parasite maintenance due to parasite virulence in a single host, B. terrestris, could be resolved through understanding the parasite's virulence in this sympatric host species. Nosema bombi significantly impacted colony growth, individual longevity, and individual development in B. lucorum. However, these effects were different both qualitatively and quantitatively to the parasite's impact in B. terrestris. Infected colonies of B. lucorum successfully produced both male and female reproductives, and infected female reproductives were capable of successful mating. Variation in life-history across host species may explain differences in the virulence, or impact of the parasite in B. terrestris and B. lucorum, with species with shorter life-cycles being more likely to transfer the parasite from one annual generation to the next. These results suggest that to understand the virulence and epidemiology of multi-host parasites we need to examine their ecological interactions across their various host species.																		0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000266429600015

Various hypotheses have been suggested for the resulting range of breeding systems and social organizations, respectively; one set of hypotheses relating to both queen number and mate number at the same time is a need for genetic variation, especially in relation to disease resistance. We here carry out a comparative analysis using phylogenetic information and, contrary to one non-phylogenetic previous study, we find that polyandry and polygyny are not significantly associated. However, the level of relatedness within colonies, a quantity affected by both polyandry and polygyny, is significantly associated with parasite loads: species with colonies with low relatedness levels have lower parasite loads. Given that, under the variance-reduction principle, selection on queens for mating frequency ought to continue even in polygynous colonies, we suggest that while parasite loads indeed seem to correlate with intra-colony genetic variability, the relationship to polyandry and polygyny may be complex and requires considerably more experimental investigation.																		0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000078864100007

We here report on the results of sampling campaigns in 2004, and 2010-2012 showing that both species have established and massively expanded their range. Bombus terrestris, in particular, has spread by some 200kmyear-1 and had reached the Atlantic coast in Argentina by the end of 2011. Both species, and especially B.terrestris, are infected by protozoan parasites that seem to spread along with the imported hosts and spillover to native species. Genetic analyses by polymorphic microsatellite loci suggest that the host population of B.terrestris is genetically diverse, as expected from a large invading founder population, and structured through isolation by distance. Genetically, the populations of the trypanosomatid parasite, Crithidia bombi, sampled in 2004 are less diverse, and distinct from the ones sampled later. Current C.bombi populations are highly heterozygous and also structured through isolation by distance correlating with the genetic distances of B.terrestris, suggesting the latter's expansion to be a main structuring factor for the parasite. Remarkably, wherever B.terrestris spreads, the native Bombus dahlbomii disappears although the reasons remain unclear. Our ecological and genetic data suggest a major invasion event that is currently unfolding in southern South America with disastrous consequences for the native bumblebee species.																		0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000337618100009	24256429

A detailed field study showed that both conopid species use the host B. pascuorum to a similar degree, while the host B. terr-luc (a pooled category of B. terrestris and B. lucorum) is more frequently parasitised than expected by S. ferrugineus. The host B. lapidarius in turn is exclusively used by P. rufipes. Furthermore, hosts of B. terr-luc and B. pascuorum parasitised by S. ferrugineus were larger than hosts parasitised by P. rufipes, or than those not parasitised. The findings suggest that S. ferrugineus selects larger hosts and may displace P. rufipes. Pupal weight, a predictor of adult body size and parasitoid fecundity, is positively correlated with host size and larger pupae are more Likely to emerge, while host species had no effect on the probability of emergence in either conopid species. Host species affected pupal weight in S. ferrugineus, but not in P. rufipes, although P. rufipes grew larger in hosts of a given size. Daughters emerged from larger pupae than males, but this did not correlate with larger host sizes. These observations add to the scarce knowledge of dipteran parasitoids.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:A1996UV66100008	28307193

In behavioural experiments we show that the phoretic instars of P. fucorum can actively transfer between flowers and foraging bumblebees. We also show that they survive on flowers for at least 24 hours. We conclude that mites associated with bumblebees can use flowers for horizontal transfer between host lineages. However, one mite associate of bumblebees, Kuzinia laevis (Astigmata: Acaridae), did not occur on flowers. This mite is small and attaches with an anal suckerplate, which may make transfer between flowers and foraging bumblebees impossible. S. acarorum, a mite of similar size to K. laevis, compensates for its limited mobility by using the larger mite P. fucorum as a vector.																		0020-1812			WOS:000071288800001

The adaptive significance of polyandry by social insect queens remains an evolutionary puzzle. Using the honeybee (Apis mellifera), we tested the hypothesis that polyandry improves a colony's resistance to disease. We established colonies headed by queens that had been artificially inseminated by either one or 10 drones. Later, we inoculated these colonies with spores of Paenibacillus larvae, the bacterium that causes a highly virulent disease of honeybee larvae (American foulbrood). We found that, on average, colonies headed by multiple-drone inseminated queens had markedly lower disease intensity and higher colony strength at the end of the summer relative to colonies headed by single-drone inseminated queens. These findings support the hypothesis that polyandry by social insect queens is an adaptation to counter disease within their colonies.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000242765300009	17015336

To increase understanding of the relationship among viruses, mites and colony decline, the tripartite relationships among bees, viruses [Kashmir bee virus (KBV) and sacbrood virus (SBV)] and varroa mites have been investigated systematically. To develop an antibody-based test for KBV, two structural recombinant proteins were purified for polyclonal-antibody production. By using ELISA and RT-PCR, the presence of KBV and SBV was studied comparatively in different developmental stages and castes of bees. The results demonstrated that KBV may persist as a viral genome with extremely low levels of viral-capsid proteins and that KBV and SBV can co-infect honeybees. This study indicated the presence of KBV and SBV RNAs in both queens and eggs by RT-PCR, suggesting a route of transovarial transmission. Horizontal transmission is also very likely among adult bees and from adult workers to larvae through contaminated food resources, because both viruses have been detected in all developmental stages and food sources (brood food, honey, pollen and royal jelly). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that mites were another possible route of horizontal transmission, as both viruses were detected in mites and their saliva. This study, for the first time, detected co-occurrence of viruses in varroa, further underlining the importance of the mites in vectoring different bee viruses. Therefore, these results indicated that multiple infection routes exist for honeybee viral diseases.																		0022-1317	1465-2099		WOS:000231033300018	16033976

Parasites and pathogens have been proposed as selective agents maintaining genetic variability in populations and promoting polyandry in social insects. Using the natural system, bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, and their trypanosome parasites, Crithidia bombi, we find that hosts vary in susceptibility or parasites in infectiousness, and that parasite transmission in social groups correlates with genetic relatedness among hosts. Therefore parasite-mediated negative frequency-dependent selection could play an important role in structuring the genetic composition of social groups by counteracting kin selection for high relatedness.																		0962-8452			WOS:A1991EV88600008

Among honey bee pathogens, RNA viruses are emerging as a serious threat and are suspected as major contributors to CCD. Recent detection of these viral species in bumble bees suggests a possible wider environmental spread of these viruses with potential broader impact. It is therefore vital to study the ecology and epidemiology of these viruses in the hymenopteran pollinator community as a whole. We studied the viral distribution in honey bees, in their pollen loads, and in other non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected from flowering plants in Pennsylvania, New York, and Illinois in the United States. Viruses in the samples were detected using reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. For the first time, we report the molecular detection of picorna-like RNA viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus and black queen cell virus) in pollen pellets collected directly from forager bees. Pollen pellets from several uninfected forager bees were detected with virus, indicating that pollen itself may harbor viruses. The viruses in the pollen and honey stored in the hive were demonstrated to be infective, with the queen becoming infected and laying infected eggs after these virus-contaminated foods were given to virus-free colonies. These viruses were detected in eleven other non-Apis hymenopteran species, ranging from many solitary bees to bumble bees and wasps. This finding further expands the viral host range and implies a possible deeper impact on the health of our ecosystem. Phylogenetic analyses support that these viruses are disseminating freely among the pollinators via the flower pollen itself. Notably, in cases where honey bee apiaries affected by CCD harbored honey bees with Israeli Acute Paralysis virus (IAPV), nearby non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators also had IAPV, while those near apiaries without IAPV did not. In containment greenhouse experiments, IAPV moved from infected honey bees to bumble bees and from infected bumble bees to honey bees within a week, demonstrating that the viruses could be transmitted from one species to another. This study adds to our present understanding of virus epidemiology and may help explain bee disease patterns and pollinator population decline in general.																		1932-6203			WOS:000285578000004	21203504	
J	Sommaggio, D								Syrphidae: can they be used as environmental bioindicators?								AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT				74	1-3			343	356		10.1016/S0167-8809(99)00042-0				JUN 1999	1999	With nearly 6000 species. Syrphidae represents one of the largest families of Diptera. Their widespread distribution, availability of excellent taxonomic keys for species identification (particularly in Europe), and differences in environmental requirements of larvae are features that promote Syrphidae as potentially good bioindicators. This paper presents a brief description of Syrphid morphology, biology and collection methods, followed by examples of their application as monitors of environmental conditions. Given the high mobility of adults, Syrphidae are probably most suitable for environmental evaluation at a larger scale, e.g., for assessment of landscape diversity. Future research aimed at a better understanding the environmental requirements of both adults and larvae should promote the utilization of these insects as bioindicators.

Invasive organisms and emerging wildlife disease pose two of the greatest threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.2. Typically, when parasites are considered in invasion biology, it is in the context of the enemy release hypothesis, wherein a non-indigenous species has greater probability of invasion success by virtue of leaving its natural enemies, including parasites, behind.3. It is also possible that native parasites may prevent invasions, but it is clear that invasive organisms may bring infectious diseases with them that can infect native competitors (via spillover), or act as competent hosts for native diseases, increasing disease prevalence among native species (via spillback).4. If the shared disease (either via spillover or spillback) has higher virulence in the native host (which is particularly likely with introduced parasites), there is the potential that the disease can act as a biological weapon leading to a disease-mediated invasion (DMI).5. Here, we review cases where disease may have been an important factor mediating a wide range of invasions in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants.6. We then focus on the invasion of the grey squirrel into the UK as a case study of a DMI, and we discuss how mathematical models have helped us to understand the importance of this shared disease and its implications for the management of invasive species.7. We conclude that (i) DMIs are a widespread phenomenon, that (ii) spillover is more common in animal invasions and spillback more common among plant invasions and that (iii) spillover DMIs are particularly important in explaining the replacement of native animals with phylogenetically similar non-indigenous species.																		0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000311433600004		
J	Szabo, Nora D.; Colla, Sheila R.; Wagner, David L.; Gall, Lawrence F.; Kerr, Jeremy T.								Do pathogen spillover, pesticide use, or habitat loss explain recent North American bumblebee declines?								CONSERVATION LETTERS				5	3			232	239		10.1111/j.1755-263X.2012.00234.x				JUN 2012	2012	Several North American bumblebee species have recently undergone dramatic declines. The use of managed, pathogen-carrying bumblebees for pollination of greenhouse crops began shortly before these declines, and wild bumblebees near greenhouses now have high pathogen loads. This has led to speculation that pathogen spillover from commercial bumblebees caused declines of these species. We test this hypothesis using a large dataset of bumblebee occurrence records and agricultural census data. We find support for the pathogen spillover hypothesis for two species but no evidence that pathogen spillover caused the near disappearance of the previously widespread Bombus affinis. Furthermore, we show that pesticide use and habitat loss are unlikely to be major causes of decline for any of the Bombus species examined. Collectively, our analyses underscore that there remains an urgent need to identify causes of pollinator population losses.																		1755-263X			WOS:000305282500009

Here, we argue that multiple anthropogenic pressures - including land-use intensification, climate change, and the spread of alien species and diseases - are primarily responsible for insect-pollinator declines. We show that a complex interplay between pressures (eg lack of food sources, diseases, and pesticides) and biological processes (eg species dispersal and interactions) at a range of scales (from genes to ecosystems) underpins the general decline in insect-pollinator populations. Interdisciplinary research on the nature and impacts of these interactions will be needed if human food security and ecosystem function are to be preserved. We highlight key areas that require research focus and outline some practical steps to alleviate the pressures on pollinators and the pollination services they deliver to wild and crop plants.																		1540-9295	1540-9309		WOS:000319857700017

In the absence of a known cause, this syndrome was named Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) because the main trait was a rapid loss of adult worker bees. We initiated a descriptive epizootiological study in order to better characterize CCD and compare risk factor exposure between populations afflicted by and not afflicted by CCD.Methods and Principal Findings: Of 61 quantified variables (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single measure emerged as a most-likely cause of CCD. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with a greater number of pathogens than control populations, suggesting either an increased exposure to pathogens or a reduced resistance of bees toward pathogens. Levels of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos (used by beekeepers to control the parasitic mite Varroa destructor) were higher in control colonies than CCD-affected colonies.Conclusions/Significance: This is the first comprehensive survey of CCD-affected bee populations that suggests CCD involves an interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. We present evidence that this condition is contagious or the result of exposure to a common risk factor. Potentially important areas for future hypothesis-driven research, including the possible legacy effect of mite parasitism and the role of honey bee resistance to pesticides, are highlighted.																		1932-6203			WOS:000268637700007	19649264

Five species of bumblebees are currently used for crop pollination, the major ones being Bombus terrestris from Eurasia and Bombus impatiens from North America. As a result of their frequent use in foreign territories, there have been reports of B. terrestris becoming established, as well as interactions and/or competition with local (bumble-) bee fauna. Of the many vegetable, fruit and seed crops that bumblebees pollinate, greenhouse tomatoes are of predominant importance. In 2004, 40 000 ha of tomato crops were pollinated, with a crop value of e 12 000 million. The growers benefit from bumblebee pollination because of lower production costs, increased yields, and improved fruit quality. The interrelationship between commercial mechanisms and ecological risks is discussed.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000238973900002

This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant-pollinator coevolution and in the long-standing concept of ''pollination syndromes.'' But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest, To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera, We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in ''phenotype space,'' there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior acid morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the ''correct'' pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information-processing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with a net loss of diversity.																		0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:A1996UN89400009

Pollen was collected from bumblebees at three greenhouses between February and September 2001 and the plant species identity of pollen collected was determined with light microscopy. A significant amount of non-tomato pollen was collected by bumblebees during. one or more months from outside each of the three greenhouses studied. The bees brought black as little as an average of 5% non-tomato pollen between February and September at one greenhouse and as much as 73% during July at another. Therefore, greenhouse, tomato growers are probably not obtaining maximum pollination benefit from bumblebee colonies and should address methods to reduce their foraging outside the greenhouse.																		0008-4220	1918-1833		WOS:000222139300021

The mechanism of how varroa mites kill honey bees remains unclear. We have addressed the effects of the mites on bee immunity and the replication of a picorna-like virus, the deformed wing virus (DWV). The expression of genes encoding three antimicrobial peptides (abaecin, defensin, and hymenoptaecin) and four immunity-related enzymes (phenol oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase, glucose oxidase, and lysozyme) were used as markers to measure the difference in the immune response. We have demonstrated an example of an ectoparasite immunosuppressing its invertebrate host with the evidence that parasitization significantly suppressed expression of these immunity-related genes. Given that ticks immunosuppress their vertebrate hosts, our finding indicates that immunosuppression of hosts may be a common phenomenon in the interaction and coevolution between ectoparasites and their vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. DWV viral titers were significantly negatively correlated with the expression levels of the immunity-related enzymes. All bees had detectable DWV. Mite-infested pupae developed into adults with either normal or deformed wings. All of the deformed-wing bees were greatly infected by DWV (approximate to 10(6) times higher than varroa-infested but normal-winged bees). Injection with heat-killed bacteria dramatically promoted DWV titers (105 times in 10 h) in the mite-infested, normal-winged bees to levels similar to those found in mite-infested, deformed-wing bees. Varroa mites may cause the serious demise of honey bees by suppressing bee immunity and by boosting the amplification of DWV in bees exposed to microbes.																		0027-8424			WOS:000229417500015	15897457

Black queen cell virus (BQCV) and Deformed wing virus (DWV) are the two most common and prevalent viruses in European honey bees, Apis mellifera. Here we provide the evidence that BQCV and DWV infect wild species of honey bees, Apis florea and Apis dorsata. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that these viruses might have moved from A. mellifera to wild bee species and that genetic relatedness as well as the geographical proximity of host species likely play an important role in host range of the viruses. The information obtained from this present study can have important implication for understanding the population structure of bee virus as well as host-virus interactions.
