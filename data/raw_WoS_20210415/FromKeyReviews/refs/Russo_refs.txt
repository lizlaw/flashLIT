J	Abel, CA; Wilson, RL								The use of diverse plant species for increasing Osmia cornifrons (Hymenoptera : Megachilidae) in field cages								JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY				71	1			23	28						JAN 1998	1998	With the exception of rosaceous tree fruit species, few plant species have been identified as suitable forage for rearing the univoltine megachilid bee, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski). Alternative forage might be useful for supplementing the resources available to the bee during orchard crop pollination. At the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station, different plant species grown in field cages were investigated for their usefulness as Osmia cornifrons forage. Of the Brassicaceae spp. tested, Brassica napus L. was superior as forage for O. cornifrons. However, B. rapa L. and Sinapis alba L. also were suitable forage for the bee. Coriander sativum L., Cucumis sativus L., and Cucumis memo L. were unsuitable as forage for this bee.																		0022-8567			WOS:000078825000004

The increasing number of invasion events by alien species and the high cost and difficulty of eradicating invasive species once established require the development of new methods and tools for predicting the most susceptible areas to invasion. Invasive pollinators pose serious threats to biodiversity and human activity due to their close relationship with many plants (including crop species) and high potential competitiveness for resources with native pollinators. Although at an early stage of expansion, the bumblebee species Bombus terrestris is becoming a representative case of pollinator invasion at a global scale, particularly given its high velocity of invasive spread and the increasing number of reports of its impacts on native bees and crops in many countries. We present here a methodological framework of habitat suitability modeling that integrates new approaches for detecting habitats that are susceptible to Bombus terrestris invasion at a global scale. Our approach did not include reported invaded locations in the modeling procedure; instead, those locations were used exclusively to evaluate the accuracy of the models in predicting suitability over regions already invaded. Moreover, a new and more intuitive approach was developed to select the models and evaluate different algorithms based on their performance and predictive convergence. Finally, we present a comprehensive global map of susceptibility to Bombus terrestris invasion that highlights priority areas for monitoring.																		1932-6203			WOS:000371219000014	26882479

(Hymenoptera: Apidae) is documented from the northwestern-most extent of its natural distribution, as the species is a potentially important pollinator of leguminous and cucurbit crops in the region. Numerous nests around the village of Ismaila, Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan, were observed and sampled from Jun through Aug 2012. Nest details were recorded and foraging times on various floral species were documented, with bees preferentially nesting in wooden stalks of Ravenna grass (Saccharum ravennae L.; Poales: Poaceae), life cycles lasting 28 to 32 d, and conditions offering the potential for easy management. The importance of such studies on wild bees in Pakistan is stressed, as are the development of biotic surveys on bees and the training of regional melittologists, coupled with outreach activities.																		0015-4040	1938-5102		WOS:000372548900015

Two of the introduced bee species, Megachile apicalis Spinola and Megachile rotundata (F.), were frequent nest site occupants and accounted for 19.6 and 3.4% of all artificial nesting cavities (trap-nests) monitored during the 1st and 2nd yr of this study, respectively. These species were most active before and after the peak in native bee nesting activity and tended to occupy xeric habitats, despite significantly higher larval mortality associated with such environments. The ability to occupy a wide array of habitats may account for the invasion success of M. apicalis in California. Another invader, the European earwig, Forficula auricularia L., was a frequent occupant of nesting cavities in mesic habitats, accounting for 59 and 85% occupancy of trap-nests during the Ist and 2nd yr of the study, respectively. Exclusion experiments indicate earwig densities were sufficient to displace female bees at nest sites with 1/3 as much nesting activity occurring in sampling units that allowed entry by earwigs as those made inaccessible to them with sticky barriers. In comparison, all native species (including bees and wasps) never accounted for >25% of all occupied nesting cavities of either monitoring period of the study.																		0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000073520800009

Habitat fragmentation can limit connectivity between populations and gene flow between bumblebee populations can be limited by open water and human altered landscapes, however the influence of landscape features on gene flow has only been examined in non-declining species. The ruderal bumblebee, Bombus ruderatus, was successfully introduced to and is now relatively common in New Zealand, providing an opportunity to examine the biology of a species that is now rare in its native range in the UK. In this study, we examine the genetic structuring of B. ruderatus populations in the South Island of New Zealand and we demonstrate that a relatively simple classification of the landscape, into either good or poor foraging habitat at coarse resolution (800 m(2)), can predict levels of gene flow. We found populations of B. ruderatus as far apart as 160 km showing no significant genetic differentiation. However, this level of gene flow appears to be reliant upon continuous suitable habitat, as other populations < 100 km apart were found to be significantly differentiated. These results suggest that corridors of continuous habitat are required to facilitate gene flow over large distances for this species.																		1566-0621	1572-9737		WOS:000376087200016

This is the first record of this exotic species for Victoria. First introduced to Australia in south-east Queensland in 2000, the species has undergone a massive range expansion since this time. The introduction of this bee may result in the proliferation and spread of environmental weeds in Victoria, and ongoing monitoring is required to determine the extent of its distribution. Behavioural observations are required to determine the potential impacts it may have on native bee and weed populations.																		0042-5184			BCI:BCI201600350776

Adults of O. cornifrons were self-marked with chicken egg-white protein powder from a dispenser nest box placed at the center of the study orchard at early bloom. Flower samples were collected from randomly selected trees (n = 30) located at different distances from the nest box. Flowers were analyzed for the presence of immunomarker protein with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Foraging patterns were determined by measuring the distance and direction of marked flowers from the nest box. While marked flowers were found out to 55 m (maximum distance sampled), most marked flowers were found within 35 m from the nest and the percentage of marked flowers declined rapidly beyond that distance. Fruit density per limb cross-sectional area (cm(2)) in the study orchard was significantly higher than in the orchard without O. cornifrons, indicating the value of O. cornifrons as pollinators in increasing fruit yield in tart cherries.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000325615200012

(Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Japanese orchard bees, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). The pesticides were acetamiprid (Assail 30SG), lambda-cyhalothrin (Warrior II), dimethoate (Dimethoate 4EC), phosmet (Imidan 70W), and imidacloprid (Provado 1.6F). At least 5 doses of each chemical, diluted in distilled water, were applied to freshly-eclosed adult bees. Mortality was assessed after 48 hr. Dose-mortality regressions were analyzed by probit analysis to test the hypotheses of parallelism and equality by likelihood ratio tests. For A. mellifera, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was imidacloprid, lambda-cyhalothrin, dimethoate, phosmet, and acetamiprid. For O. cornifrons, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was dimethoate, lambda-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and phosmet. Interaction of imidacloprid or acetamiprid with the fungicide fenbuconazole (Indar 2F) was also tested in a 1:1 proportion for each species. Estimates of response parameters for each mixture component applied to each species were compared with dose-response data for each mixture in statistical tests of the hypothesis of independent joint action. For each mixture, the interaction of fenbuconazole (a material non-toxic to both species) was significant and positive along the entire line for the pesticide. Our results clearly show that responses of A. mellifera cannot be extrapolated to responses of O. cornifrons, and that synergism of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides occurs using formulated product in mixtures as they are commonly applied in apple orchards.																		1932-6203			WOS:000326405300014	24039783

Rates of parasitism were measured in both managed and wild trap-nested populations. Only two parasites, the drosophilid fly Cacoxenus sp., and the cleptoparasitic mite Chaetodactylus osmiae, were found in wild populations, but their rates of parasitism rarely exceeded 10%. Cacoxenus was never found in managed populations, but the torymid wasp Monodontomerus obsoletus caused serious damage in some populations when bee cocoons were made accessible by extricating them from nesting materials in the laboratory. Chaetodactylus osmiae was also present in managed populations but in low numbers. In 1991, a population of O. cornuta was released in an almond orchard. As opposed to other releases in which 'clean' populations were used, in this release some cells infested with C. osmiae, Cacoxenus sp., and M. obsoletus were intentionally introduced with the bee population. No cell was reparasitized by Cacoxenus sp., because by the time these drosophilids became adults the flying season of the O. cornuta population was almost over. On the other hand, the number of cells infested with C. osmiae mites increased to six times the number of infested cells originally introduced. Most M. obsoletus developed normally, and parasitism by this wasp increased slightly (from 20 to 30 cells). As O. cornuta flies very early in the season when few species of parasites or nest destroyers are active, the diversity of associated fauna is usually lower in O. cornuta nests than in nests of other, related, later-flying species such as O. rufa and O. tricornis.																		0021-8839			WOS:A1992KX72500004

Across a 240 km(2) watershed in Washington, the 24 most populous of 56 nest sites found were annually surveyed for nesting bees for 8 years. Alkali bees multiplied 9-fold to 17 million females, the largest reported metapopulation of non-social bees. Several sites have remained populous for an unprecedented 50 years. The most populous nesting bed (1.5 ha) grew to 5.3 million nesting females (median = 278 nests/m(2)), the largest bee nesting aggregation ever recorded. This first-ever exhaustive landscape-level survey for any non-social bee reveals that even amid intensive conventional agriculture, a native bee can sustainably multiply to vast numbers, its nesting aggregations persisting for decades.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000256154100004

Invasive flammable grasses, deforestation, historical fire suppression and human ignition are increasing fire frequency and intensifying its severity, as well as introducing fire to previously fireproof biomes. In many of these habitats, bees are key pollinators. Many, often most of the solitary bee species and individuals in these biomes nest underground (so-called "mining" bees). To evaluate their susceptibility to fire, we tested heat tolerances of bees' four life stages using an experimental design that mimicked heat conduction dynamics of natural soils. All life stages survived heating of up to 45 degrees C for 27 min, but none survived heating at 54 degrees C for 9 min; the pupal stage survived best. At near-lethal temperatures, more prolonged heating caused more mortality. These data were related to published studies of heat penetration depths in soil during fire and an exhaustive compilation of published nesting depths reported for mining bees. We conclude that a small fraction (9%) of the shallowest-nesting mining bee species is likely to die from soil heating by wildfire. Among these, ground-nesting megachilids (Osmia, Megachile) will be most vulnerable, owing to their shallow horizontal nests. Because mining bees prevail in most biomes of the temperate zone, any vegetation rehabilitation efforts should therefore expect that bee communities will largely survive the immediate effects of wildfire, and therefore will need pollen and nectar resources in the year(s) after fire.

These include the honey bee (Apis mellifera): alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata), alkali bee (Nomia melanderi), and several species each of mason bees (Osmia spp.) and Bumblebees (Bombus spp.). Among these managed pollinators, only the alkali bee nests in the ground, although ground-nesting bee taxa predominate outside of the lowland tropics. Despite their many desirable qualities for agricultural pollination, including fixed host fidelity (oligolecty), superior pollination efficiencies, reliable synchronization with bloom and gregarious nesting habits, ground-nesting bees have generally defied attempts at manipulative management.Progress in managing ground-nesting bees has been impeded by our limited insights into the sensory cues and behavioral mechanisms responsible for nest site philopatry and the recruitment of females into conspecific nesting aggregations. Candidate cues include olfactory attractants (mandibular, labial and Dufour's gland secretions), visual landmarks and soil quality. The olfactory cues are likely recognized instinctively or by imprinting, possibly at eclosion. In contrast, visual cues are probably learned during orientation flights, as is known for Apis and several sphecid wasps. Specific hypotheses are reviewed and possible experimental designs are proposed in the hope of encouraging resolution of these long-standing, fundamental facets of bee biology.					7th International Symposium on Pollination, Pollination - From Theory to Practise7th International Symposium on Pollination, Pollination - From Theory to Practise	JUN 23-28, 1996JUN 23-28, 1996	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	LETHBRIDGE, CANADALETHBRIDGE, CANADA										0567-7572		90-6605-978-8	WOS:000071737300038

Creating patches with high plant diversity within farmland is commonly suggested as a measure to benefit pollinators. However, farmers rarely adopt such practice, instead removing naturally occurring plants (weeds). By combining pollinator exclusion experiments with analysis of honeybee behaviour and flower-visitation webs, we found that the presence of weeds allowed pollinators to persist within sunflower fields, maximizing the benefits of the remaining patches of natural habitat to productivity of this large-scale crop. Weed diversity increased flower visitor diversity, hence ameliorating the measured negative effects of isolation from natural habitat. Although honeybees were the most abundant visitors, diversity of flower visitors enhanced honeybee movement, being the main factor influencing productivity. Conservation of natural patches combined with promoting flowering plants within crops can maximize productivity and, therefore, reduce the need for cropland expansion, contributing towards sustainable agriculture.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000287528600006	21244594

(Apidae) is a native of temperate Eurasia and has been moved around the world since the 1800s. Dispersal of B. terrestris gained momentum in the 1980s when bees were reared artificially in Europe and supplied commercially for greenhouse pollination services. Very early after its commercial introduction, it was recognized that this species is invasive, can island hop to new locations and may disturb local ecosystems. The invasive characteristics of B. terrestris are: high migration ability, early seasonal emergence, high adaptability under adverse climatic conditions in various habitats, generalist or polylectic foraging strategies, enabling it to work a wide variety of flowers for resources, foraging over wide distances, a thermoregulatory metabolism that enables it to withstand low temperatures, no natural enemies to check population growth in areas outside its natural range, and it may develop two reproductive cycles in a year (bivoltine) in a newly colonized area. In addition, commercial bees produce more gynes and are better competitors than the local conspecific populations and may replace them in the likely event of an escape. The documented evidence on invasive impact of B. terrestris on natural ecosystems includes: negative interactions with local bee fauna, competition for nest sites with, and genetic contamination of, local Bombus spp., spread of parasites and pathogens and negative interactions with plant reproductive capacity. We discuss the possible measures that must be taken to minimize the B. terrestris invasion on local as well as on global levels.																		0003-6862	1347-605X		WOS:000276579400013

J	Donovan, B. J.								Interactions between native and introduced bees in New Zealand.								New Zealand Journal of Ecology				3				104	116						1980	1980	There are about 40 species of native bees in New Zealand, 36 of which belong to the Colletidae family, and the rest to the Halictidae. Introduced species include Apis mellifera, 4 Bombus species, and Nomia melanderi and Megachile rotundata. Honeybees in commercial apiaries, and other introduced species, forage mainly on introduced plants, but some honeybees do compete with native bees on native plants. The peak of foraging by native bees occurs at the season of the main honey flow, when there is most food. It is thought that competition for nest sites does not occur. It is concluded that the introduced species do not have a deleterious effect on native species; much more information on the latter is needed. P.

J	Downing, Jason L.; Liu, Hong								Friend or foe? Impacts of the introduced tropical oil bee Centris nitida on a threatened and specialized native mutualism in Southern Florida								BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS				14	10			2175	2185		10.1007/s10530-012-0223-z				OCT 2012	2012	While we understand a great deal on the impacts of introduced generalist pollinators on the native ecosystems, very little is known about the impacts of naturalized specialist pollinators. The oil-collecting bee Centris nitida, which has recently naturalized in southern Florida, has been identified as a novel participant in an endemic specialized mutualism between Byrsonima lucida, a threatened native oil plant, and Centris errans, its sole native pollinator. In this study, we determined the impacts of this novel pollinator on B. lucida by assessing the degree of its pollen limitations in sites with and without the introduced oil bee, as well as in natural and garden settings. We also compared the key processes of pollination for both of the Centris bee species. The degrees of pollen limitation sustained by B. lucida were similar among sites with or without the introduced oil bee, and among natural or garden sites. The native oil bee's visitation rates (no. of visits/minute/flower) to B. lucida plants were not significantly reduced at sites where the introduced oil bees were present. The native oil bee had a lower foraging rate (no. of flowers visited/minute) and was a less efficient pollinator than the introduced oil bee. There has been no observed negative impact to either the native oil plant or bee, the introduced bee is absent in most natural areas, and it is also possible that the bee may arrive naturally given the trend in global warming. In light of these facts, we do not recommend any management action towards this introduced oil bee.																		1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000308037700017

Mitchell's key to eastern USA megachilid genera is revised to include Chelostoma. [Also included in the key are Heriades, Ashmeadiella, Prochelostoma, Hoplitis and Osmia.] They are distinguished from similar New York Megachilidae (Prochelostoma and Hoplitis) by the shape of metasomal tergum VII of the males and the clypeal apex of the females. Both species are oligolectin on bellflowers, Campanula, and construct nests in pre-existing cavities, primarily in old wood. Nine exotic species of megachilid bees are established in North America, of which 4 are known only from New York State [Hoplitis anthocopoides (Schenck), Anthidium manicatum (L.), C. fuliginosum and C. campanularum].																		0033-2615			BCI:BCI198273025463

The imported dwarf honey bee Apis florea exploited 11 of these. The main pollen flow in the study area occurred between early December and late March. This is reflected by the amount of pollen collected by colonies of A. mellifera sudanensis. In spite of observations conducted soon after the introduction of A. florea, which gave hints of competition between the two bee species, further studies showed that A. mellifera sudanensis and A. florea do seem to coexist. This coexistence is based on different daily rhythms of pollen collection. A. mellifera collected pollen of Acacia seyal, date palm, and onions early in the morning ( and partly in the late afternoon), while A. florea started pollen collection mostly later in the morning and ended it earlier in the afternoon. But in contrast to A. mellifera, A. florea was collecting pollen all day without interruption, even at very high air temperatures. Niche overlap ( concerning the times of visits to flowers) between the two bee species was very low in date palms, and of medium importance in Acacia seyal. But it is remarkable that in total, A. florea is always present in higher numbers than A. mellifera sudanensis, on flowers. The significance of the introduction of A. florea to Sudan for pollination is discussed.																		0931-2048			WOS:000179579600007

Il rilevamento dell'elemento piombo nell'ambiente mediante l'uso della cella peotrofica di Osmia cornuta (Hymenoptera, Megachilidae).				Annali della Facolta di Medicina Veterinaria di Pisa				59				263	274						2006	2006	This investigation has become part of the wider study of interaction between Apoidea and the environment where they live and reproduce, even in the light of the new interest for rearing and using Apoidea of the genus Osmia sp. for monitoring the biodiversity and recently as a bioindicator of pesticides and heavy metals. This study investigated the possibility of detecting environmental lead by using Osmia cornuta pedotrophic cell. Soil, pollen provisions, cocoons, the wole insect as imago and faeces were sampled within the pedotrophic cell. Analysis were made with inductive coupling plasma-optic emission spectroscopy technique (ICP-OES). In this investigation, the pedotrophic cell is considered as a closed system, where everything introduced with pollen by the nesting Osmia female is entirely consumed and metabolized by the new hatched larva. Therefore, lead that is in the pollen provision which is entirely consumed by the Osmia larva should be found in the new insect, in the cocoon, in the faeces or in all of them. Results show that the same amount of lead that was in the pollen provision is equally distributed throughout the three samples of the pedotrophic cell. This preliminary investigation allows us to propose the pedotrophic cell of Osmia cornuta as a potential suitable tool for the biomonitoring of environmental metals.																		0365-4729			CABI:20083144021

Cavity-nesting, solitary bee species were systematically monitored in wooden trap nests at 6 sites in northern central California from 1990 to 1992. Three sites were in the San Joaquin Valley in wildlife refuges or preserves; 3 were in coastal mountain or Sierran foothill parks or reserves. Differences in frequencies of nesting bees were observed and recorded among sites and habitats through time. A Poisson regression indicated that all explanatory variables and their Ist order interactions were highly significant. There were significant differences among bee taxa, sites and years, and their interactions (bee x site; bee x year; site x year). Megachile species were the predominant cavity nesters in the 3 valley sites; Osmia species were the common group in coastal mountain/foothill sites. In a computer simulation, using a variation of the Poisson regression, several significant differences were also observed between yearly frequency counts for certain bee species at the same site. Possible reasons for year to year changes included differential natural mortality, extreme annual weather patterns, use of marginal habitats, and negative impacts from exotic solitary bee species. Three exotic megachilids (Megachile rotundata (F.), M. apicalis Spinola, and M. concinna Smith) have successfully invaded and become established in California. Possibly, M. apicalis has affected other cavity nesting bee species, including the exotic M rotundata in our Central Valley sites.																		0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000076639500010

We re-examine the phylogeny of this genus, using an expanded set of taxa from Madagascar and Malawi and additional sequence data, in order to determine the number of dispersals and the timeframe over which they occurred.Location Africa, Madagascar, Malawi, Asia and Australia.Methods One nuclear (EF-1 alpha F2) and two mitochondrial (CO1 and Cyt b) gene regions were sequenced for 36 allodapine bee species (including members of the genera Braunsapis, Nasutapis, Allodape, Allodapula, and Macrogalea) and one ceratinine species (Ceratina japonica). We used Bayesian analyses to examine phylogenetic structure and a penalized likelihood approach to estimate approximate ages for key divergences in our phylogeny.Results Our analyses indicate a tropical African origin for Braunsapis in the early Miocene followed by very early dispersal into Asia and then a subsequent dispersal, following Asian diversification, into Australia during the late Miocene. There have also been two dispersals of Braunsapis from Africa to Madagascar and this result, when combined with phylogenetic and biogeographical data for other allodapines, suggests that these bees have the ability to cross moderately large ocean expanses. These dispersals may have been aided by the West Wind Drift, but rafting across the Mozambique Channel is also possible, and could be aided by the existence of developmental stages that require minimal or no feeding and by tolerance to sea water and spume. Accumulating evidence suggests that many biogeographical patterns in the southern hemisphere may be better explained by dispersal than by Gondwanan vicariance hypotheses. Our results add to this growing body of data and raise the possibility that some puzzling trans-Indian Ocean distributions may also be explained by historical dispersal events across oceanic barriers that now seem insuperable.																		0305-0270			WOS:000233408500008

Whether such declines reduce crop yields, or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey bees, is unclear. We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower visitation by wild insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast, fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation by honey bees in only 14% of the systems surveyed. Overall, wild insects pollinated crops more effectively; an increase in wild insect visitation enhanced fruit set by twice as much as an equivalent increase in honey bee visitation. Visitation by wild insects and honey bees promoted fruit set independently, so pollination by managed honey bees supplemented, rather than substituted for, pollination by wild insects. Our results suggest that new practices for integrated management of both honey bees and diverse wild insect assemblages will enhance global crop yields.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000316731600049	23449997	
J	Genaro, Julio A.								Origins, composition and distribution of the bees of Cuba (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila).								Insecta Mundi				0052				1	16						5 December 2008	2008	The origins of the Cuban bee fauna are reviewed. This fauna began to form 40 million years ago during the Proto Antilles period, through ancestors that arrived in successive invasions from adjacent continental areas. The composition of the Antillean fauna has evolved continuously over millions of years until the present time. The native bee fauna of Cuba is represented by 89 species, contained in 29 genera and 4 families. The number of genera represented per family is as follows: Colletidae (3), Halictidae (8), Megachilidae (4), and Apidae (14). The Cuban apifauna contains four principal groups with distinct biogeographic histories: endemic species of Cuba (43.8%); endemic species of the Antilles shared among multiple islands (33.1%); continental species whose distribution includes the Antilles (16.8%); and species introduced through human activity (6.3%). An analysis of the distributions of Cuban bee species reveals that areas of highest species endemism coincide with the main mountainous nuclei of the East, Center and West. These were: the Sierra Maestra mountain range (with 25 species), Nipe-Sagua-Baracoa (15), the Mountain range of Guaniguanico (14) and the Massif of Guamuaya (14). The distribution of the bees in the Cuban Archipelago was not uniform, possibly due to the ecological conditions of the respective habitats, the diversity and presence of specific food plants, and interspecific competition. The endemism of bees in Greater Antilles is considered high keeping in mind the mobility of the group, as observed not only in Cuba (43.8%) but also Jamaica (50%), Hispaniola (45.6%), and in Puerto Rico and adjacent islands (26.5 %).																		0749-6737			ZOOREC:ZOOR14502012168

In 2005, this species was reported from Nova Scotia, a rapid and wide increase in its distribution. In this paper, we document a similar rapid spread of A. manicatum into western North America, including British Columbia and Idaho, and discuss the potential risks of this species in eastern Canada. In addition, the potential of DNA barcoding as a rapid and reliable means of recognizing adventive bee species is advocated.																		0022-8567	1937-2353		WOS:000265226600002

The survey focused on bees, with more limited data gathered for other incidentally collected groups such as apoid and vespid wasps. Surveys in 2003 with nets and bowls recorded 144 bee species (26 genera), 22 vespid species (9 genera) and 23 crabronid species (12 genera). Noteworthy records are detailed. A preliminary checklist of the bee fauna of the BRF is presented and discussed in relation to that of New York State, selected sites within the state, and of the northeastern USA as a whole. The cleptoparasitic species Sphecodes fattigi Mitchell, Sphecodes johnsonii Lovell, and Lasioglossum (Dialictus) michiganense (Mitchell), and the oligolectic species Osmia (Melanosmia) inermis (Zetterstedt) are newly recorded from New York State. Ecological patterns pertaining to sociality, nest type, pollen specialization, parasitism, and phenology, are summarized and discussed, as are the efficacies of different collecting methods. The net collected sample was richer than the bowl trapped sample in total bee species (117 vs. 113) and in the number of unique species (29, 20.4% vs. 25, 17.6%).																		1070-9428	1314-2607		WOS:000244342800003

EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY				59	1-2			245	261		10.1007/s10493-012-9609-y				FEB 2013	2013	Japan's economy depends on the importation of natural resources, and as a result, Japan is subjected to a high risk of biological invasion. Although Japan has quarantine systems to protect ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and human health against alien species, economic globalization has resulted in an ever-increasing risk of invasion. Mite invasion is no exception. Alien species that impact natural ecosystems are regulated in Japan by the Invasive Alien Species Act. However, the law focuses only on visibly recognizable species, so that species too small to see, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mites, are beyond the scope of this law. The Plant Protection Law has limited the introduction of alien pests, including mites, that are harmful to agricultural crops. Recently, the liberalization of global trade policies have increased pressure to loosen regulations on various pests, including spider mites. Infectious diseases and their causative species are quarantined under the Rabies Prevention Law, the Domestic Animal Infectious Diseases Control Law, and the Human Infectious Diseases Control Law, but these laws do not cover wildlife diseases. The most serious problem is that wild reptiles, which can be carriers of ticks and tick-borne diseases, can be freely introduced to Japan. These loopholes in Japan's regulatory system have resulted in mite and tick invasions, which affect not only wildlife communities and human society but also endemism and biological diversity of natural mite populations.																		0168-8162			WOS:000313653200012	23001476

As a result several bee species have been introduced to countries far beyond their home range, including A. mellifera, bumblebees (Bombus sp.), the alfalfa leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata, and various other solitary species. Possible negative consequences of these introductions include: competition with native pollinators for floral resources; competition for nest sites; co-introduction of natural enemies, particularly pathogens that may infect native organisms; pollination of exotic weeds; and disruption of pollination of native plants. For most exotic bee species little or nothing is known of these possible effects. Research to date has focused mainly on A. mellifera, and has largely been concerned with detecting competition with native flower visitors. Considerable circumstantial evidence has accrued that competition does occur, but no experiment has clearly demonstrated long-term reductions in populations of native organisms. Most researchers agree that this probably reflects the difficulty of carrying out convincing studies of competition between such mobile organisms, rather than a genuine absence of competitive effects. Effects on seed set of exotic weeds are easier to demonstrate. Exotic bees often exhibit marked preferences for visiting flowers of exotic plants. For example, in Australia and New Zealand many weeds from Europe are now visited by European honeybees and bumblebees. Introduced bees are primary pollinators of a number of serious weeds. Negative impacts of exotic bees need to be carefully assessed before further introductions are carried out.																		1543-592X	1545-2069		WOS:000220102000001

The rotation of maize with another crop, principally soybeans, Glycine wax (L.), was the primary management strategy utilized by North American producers and remained highly effective until the mid-1990s. In 1995, widespread and severe root injure, occurred in east-central Illinois and northern Indiana maize fields that had been annually rotated with so beans on a regular basis for several decades. The failure of this cultural tactic from a pest management perspective was attributed to a behavioral adaptation by a variant western corn rootworm that had lost fidelity to maize for egg laying. In 1992, an infestation of western corn rootworm was found within a small maize field near the Belgrade Airport. B)72007, the presence of this insect pest had been confirmed in 20 European countries. More recent Molecular Studies have confirmed that at least three separate invasions (until 2004) of western corn rootworms have Occurred in Europe, increasing the risk that rotation-resistant western corn rootworms will be introduce(] into a new continent. Although biological control and use of conventional resistant maize hybrids have not achieved widespread Success in the management of western corn rootworms in North America, these tactics are being evaluated in Europe.																		0066-4170	1545-4487		WOS:000262482300017	19067634

Yet honey bees are not always the most efficient pollinators of all crops and are declining in various parts of the world. Crop pollination shortages are becoming increasingly common. We found that behavioral interactions between wild and honey bees increase the pollination efficiency of honey bees on hybrid sunflower up to 5-fold, effectively doubling honey bee pollination services on the average field. These indirect contributions caused by interspecific interactions between wild and honey bees were more than five times more important than the contributions wild bees make to sunflower pollination directly. Both proximity to natural habitat and crop planting practices were significantly correlated with pollination services provided directly and indirectly by wild bees. Our results suggest that conserving wild habitat at the landscape scale and altering selected farm management techniques could increase hybrid sunflower production. These findings also demonstrate the economic importance of interspecific interactions for ecosystem services and suggest that protecting wild bee populations can help buffer the human food supply from honey bee shortages.																		0027-8424			WOS:000240648300061	16940358

Multiple recent introductions of apid bees into Pacific archipelagos signify potentially large consequences for both agriculture and indigenous ecosystems								BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS				16	11			2293	2302		10.1007/s10530-014-0664-7				NOV 2014	2014	The islands of the south west Pacific (SWP) are highly biodiverse, yet records of their bee fauna suggest a region depauperate of a key pollinator suite. Studies of the bees of Fiji based on molecular data have revealed a recent origin with the majority of species having arrived since the last glacial maximum or introduced since human colonization. Here we use DNA barcodes to provide the first detailed account of Apidae bees from Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa. We show that most if not all species in these archipelagos have been recently introduced from Australia and south east Asia, with a further species introduced from the New World. Some of these species have become regionally abundant and we discuss the potential impact of introduced pollinators on endemic plant-pollinator associations. Given the wide-reaching role of native pollinators in island systems, yet lack of understanding of SWP pollinator suites, our study highlights the urgent need for more detailed pollinator research in the region.																		1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000342490100004

These introduced species have the potential to both disrupt native pollinator suites as well as augment crop pollination, but for most species the timings of introduction are unknown. We examined the distribution and nesting biology of the long-tongued bee Braunsapis puangensis that was first recorded from Fiji in 2007. This bee has now become widespread in Fiji and both its local abundance and geographical range are likely to increase dramatically. The impacts of this invasion are potentially enormous for agriculture and native ecosystems, but they also provide opportunities for understanding how social insect species adapt to new environments. We outline the major issues associated with this recent invasion and argue that a long-term monitoring study is needed.																		1672-9609	1744-7917		WOS:000358380600006	24799358

Recipe for disruption: multiple recent arrivals of megachilid bees in Pacific archipelagos								JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION				18	4			613	622		10.1007/s10841-014-9665-1				AUG 2014	2014	When examining how the ecosystems of remote islands have developed, it is important to know the timing of when various elements arrived and whether they then diversified. Our understanding of the histories behind the biodiverse south west Pacific (SWP) archipelagos is limited, and further impeded by the complex geological histories of this region. Previous studies of the SWP short-tongued halictine bee fauna suggest their presence is much younger than the geological ages of these archipelagos, which is surprising given their critical role as pollinators in other terrestrial ecosystems. The long-tongued megachilid bees represent a considerable proportion of the known bee species for the region, yet little is known of their origin. Here we use genetic diversity within mitochondrial DNA to infer the likely ages and origins of megachilid species from Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa. Our results indicate a very recent origin for megachilids in the SWP, with many species exhibiting small intraspecific genetic distances. Three species share almost identical haplotypes with specimens from Southeast Asia, suggesting multiple human-aided introductions. Combined with data from recent studies on other bee groups present in the region, our results have broad implications for how the Pacific island biota developed and how we should approach its management.																		1366-638X	1572-9753		WOS:000340450000009

This region is about 1500 km apart from its next occurrences in Sudan where it had been introduced and first detected in 1985 and about 2000 km apart from its next natural occurrences in Iran and Oman. These bees apparently have been imported by human transport, most likely by ship. This new location thus represents a major jump in the progression of the species still to fill a wide area of possible locations offering adequate living conditions. Here we attempt to track the possible origin of this new population by morphometric methods. This analysis indicated closest relation to A. florea from Oman, thus being the most likely source of this population.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000267832900009

As geographic ranges of bees or their host plants change as a result of human activities, we need to identify pathogens that could be transmitted among newly sympatric species to evaluate and anticipate their effects on bee communities. We used PCR screening and DNA sequencing to evaluate exposure to potentially disease-causing microorganisms in a pollinator of apple, the horned mason bee (Osmia cornifrons). We did not detect microsporidia, Wolbachia, or trypanosomes, which are common pathogens of bees, in any of the hundreds of mason bees screened. We did detect both pathogenic and apathogenic (saprophytic) fungal species in the genus Ascosphaera (chalkbrood), an unidentified species of Aspergillus fungus, and a strain of bacteria in the genus Paenibacillus that is probably apathogenic. We detected pathogenic fungal strains in asymptomatic adult bees that therefore may be carriers of disease. We demonstrate that fungi from the genus Ascosphaera have been transported to North America along with the bee from its native range in Japan, and that O. cornifrons is exposed to fungi previously only identified from nests of other related bee species. Further study will be required to quantify pathogenicity and health effects of these different microbial species on O. cornifrons and on closely-related native North American mason bees that may now be exposed to novel pathogens. A global perspective is required for pathogen research as geographic ranges of insects and microorganisms shift due to intentional or accidental introductions.																		1932-6203			WOS:000356901900051	26102072

The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) was introduced primarily for honey production but has become the most important insect pollinator of seed, vegetable, fruit crops and pastures. The remaining species (Born bus terrestris (L.), B. hortorum (L.), B. ruderatus (F.), B. subterraneus (L.), Megachile rotundata (F.), Nomia melanderi (Cockerell), Osmia coerulescens (L.) were introduced to pollinate either red clover (Trifolium pratense) or lucerne (Medicago sativa). The honey bee has almost exclusively been relied upon for crop pollination although species of Bombus and M rotundata are occasionally used commercially. The spread throughout New Zealand of the varroa mite (Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman), a parasite that exclusively kills honey bees, has increased the cost of managing honey bee hives. The use of alternative bee species for crop pollination may reduce the potential impact of factors influencing the availability and cost of honey bee pollination services. However, consideration must be given to the potential impact that expanding populations of introduced bees could have on native and exotic flora and fauna. This review examines the current and potential use of the eight deliberately introduced bee species in New Zealand, their distribution, and potential impact on New Zealand's biota.																		0077-9962	1179-3430		WOS:000283014400012

Carpenter bees (tribes Xylocopini and Ceratinini) have ecological associations with specific Sennertia spp. in all geographic regions of their distribution, thus it is worried that the introduced carpenter bee has brought non-indigenous mites into Japan. In their native ranges, X. a. circumvolans and X. tranquebarorum each has specific Sennertia mite faunas: the four Japanese Alloxylocopa bees including X. a. circumvolans have associations with S. alfkeni, while X. tranquebarorum has association with S. potanini in China (except Taiwan) and with S. horrida in South to East Asia including Taiwan. In the present study, we examined phoretic mite fauna on the introduced X. tranquebarorum, and determined whether the mites are indigenous or not based on morphological character and two gene sequences (mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer). It was found from the result of this study that the non-indigenous Sennertia mite has invaded Japan with the introduced X. tranquebarorum. We discuss geographic origin of the introduced X. tranquebarorum based on associated mite fauna and potential ecological risk caused by the introduced Xylocopa-Sennertia association.																		1343-8786			WOS:000282222400005

However, the need for active conservation of pollination interactions is only now being appreciated. Pollination systems are under increasing threat from anthropogenic sources, including fragmentation of habitat, changes in land use, modern agricultural practices, use of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, and invasions of non-native plants and animals. Honeybees, which themselves are non-native pollinators on most continents, and which may harm native bees and other pollinators, are nonetheless critically important for crop pollination. Recent declines in honeybee numbers in the United States and Europe bring home the importance of healthy pollination systems, and the need to further develop native bees and other animals as crop pollinators. The "pollination crisis" that is evident in declines of honeybees and native bees, and in damage to webs of plant-pollinator interaction, may be ameliorated not only by cultivation of a diversity of crop pollinators, but also by changes in habitat use and agricultural practices, species reintroductions and removals, and other means. In addition, ecologists must redouble efforts to study basic aspects of plant-pollinator interactions if optimal management decisions are to be made for conservation of these interactions in natural acid agricultural ecosystems.																		0066-4162			WOS:000077648200004

Since the 1980s, A. cerana has been introduced to areas outside its natural range (namely New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Australia), which sparked fears that it may become a pest species that could compete with, and negatively affect, native Australian fauna and flora, as well as commercially kept A. mellifera and commercial crops. This literature review is a response to these concerns and reviews what is known about the ecology and behaviour of A. cerana. Differences between temperate and tropical strains of A. cerana are reviewed, as are A. cerana pollination, competition between A. cerana and A. mellifera, and the impact and control strategies of introduced A. cerana, with a particular focus on gaps of current knowledge.																		2075-4450			CABI:20143043738	26462524

As of March 2009, isolated populations of emerald ash borer (EAB) have been detected in nine additional states and Quebec. EAB is a highly invasive forest pest that has the potential to spread and kill native ash trees (Fraxinus sp.) throughout the United States. We estimate the discounted cost of ash treatment, removal, and replacement on developed land within communities in a 25-state study area centered on Detroit using simulations of EAB spread and infestation over the next decade (2009-2019). An estimated 38 million ash trees occur on this land base. The simulations predict an expanding EAB infestation that will likely encompass most of the 25 states and warrant treatment. removal, and replacement of more than 17 million ash trees with mean discounted cost of $10.7 billion. Expanding the land base to include developed land outside, as well as inside, communities nearly double the estimates of the number of ash trees treated or removed and replaced, and the associated cost. The estimates of discounted cost suggest that a substantial investment might be efficiently spent to slow the expansion of isolated EAB infestations and postpone the ultimate costs of ash treatment, removal, and replacement.

Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000244883700006	17355569

The deduced amino acid sequence of the O.cornifrons vitellogenin cDNA showed a 66% identity with Megachile rotundata, 53% to Apis mellifera, 51% to Bombus ignitus and 42%-30% with other hymenopteran insect vitellogenins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that O.cornifrons vitellogenin clustered with vitellogenins from Megachilidae, Apidae, Vespidae and Formicidae species but not with those from Pteromalidae, Aphelinidae or Ichneumonidae species. The expression profile of O.cornifrons vitellogenin mRNA during development revealed that O.cornifrons vitellogenin was first detected in the pupal stage and was continuously detected during the adult stage. Interestingly, O.cornifrons vitellogenin mRNA expression was low in mid-diapause, then gradually increased beginning on day3 of the newly emerged adult stage, and subsequently declined. These results suggest that the expression level of O.cornifrons vitellogenin mRNA is stage-specific.																		1738-2297	1748-5967		WOS:000352020200006		
J	Liu, Hong; Pemberton, Robert								Pollination of an invasive orchid, Cyrtopodium polyphyllum (Orchidaceae), by an invasive oil-collecting bee, Centris nitida, in southern Florida								BOTANY				88	3			290	295		10.1139/B10-017				MAR 2010	2010	The lack of appropriate pollinators is believed to be an impediment to naturalization of orchids. We studied the self-compatibility and pollination of an invasive, showy, rewardless, terrestrial orchid (Cyrtopodium polyphyllum (Vell.) Pabst ex F. Barrios) in southern Florida. Pollination treatments indicated that the orchid is self-compatible but not autogamous. Visitor observations indicated that the orchid is pollinated by an invasive specialist oil-collecting bee (Centris nitida Smith). The presence of the invasive Centris nitida has probably contributed to the naturalization of this probable oil reward mimicking orchid in Florida. We contrasted our results in the orchid's native range. In the invasive range in Florida, the orchid experiences a lower inbreeding depression. In both areas, the orchid is pollinated by Centris species and the pollination of the orchid is apparently enhanced by the presence of oil-rewarding species of the Malpighiaceae.																		1916-2790	1916-2804		WOS:000275354100009		
J	Liu, Hong; Pemberton, Robert W.								Solitary invasive orchid bee outperforms co-occurring native bees to promote fruit set of an invasive Solanum								OECOLOGIA				159	3			515	525		10.1007/s00442-008-1232-6				MAR 2009	2009	Our understanding of the effects of introduced invasive pollinators on plants has been exclusively drawn from studies on introduced social bees. One might expect, however, that the impacts of introduced solitary bees, with much lower population densities and fewer foragers, would be small. Yet little is known about the potential effects of naturalized solitary bees on the environment. We took advantage of the recent naturalization of an orchid bee, Euglossa viridissima, in southern Florida to study the effects of this solitary bee on reproduction of Solanum torvum, an invasive shrub. Flowers of S. torvum require specialized buzz pollination. Through timed floral visitor watches and two pollination treatments (control and pollen supplementation) at three forest edge and three open area sites, we found that the fruit set of S. torvum was pollen limited at the open sites where the native bees dominate, but was not pollen limited at the forest sites where the invasive orchid bees dominate. The orchid bee's pollination efficiency was nearly double that of the native halictid bees, and was also slightly higher than that of the native carpenter bee. Experiments using small and large mesh cages (to deny or allow E. viridissima access, respectively) at one forest site indicated that when the orchid bee was excluded, the flowers set one-quarter as many fruit as when the bee was allowed access. The orchid bee was the most important pollinator of the weed at the forest sites, which could pose additional challenges to the management of this weed in the fragmented, endangered tropical hardwood forests in the region. This specialized invasive mutualism may promote populations of both the orchid bee and this noxious weed. Invasive solitary bees, particularly species that are specialized pollinators, appear to have more importance than has previously been recognized.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000263418800005	19066971

We restrict our focus to services provided by "wild" insects; we do riot include services from domesticated or mass-reared insect species. The four insect services for which we provide value estimates-dung burial, pest control, pollination, and wildlife nutrition-were chosen not because of their importance but because of the availability of data and an algorithm for their estimation. We base our estimations of the value of each service oil projections of losses that would accrue if insects were not functioning at their current level. We estimate the annual value of these ecological services provided in the United States to be at least $57 billion, all amount that justifies greater investment in the conservation of these services.																		0006-3568	1525-3244		WOS:000236750500011

Nonnative insects have accumulated in United States forests at a rate of similar to 2.5 per yr over the last 150 yr. Currently the two major pathways of introduction are importation of live plants and wood packing material such as pallets and crates. Introduced insects and diseases occur in forests and cities throughout the United States, and the problem is particularly severe in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. Nonnative forest pests are the only disturbance agent that has effectively eliminated entire tree species or genera from United States forests within decades. The resulting shift in forest structure and species composition alters ecosystem functions such as productivity, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat. In urban and suburban areas, loss of trees from streets, yards, and parks affects aesthetics, property values, shading, stormwater runoff, and human health. The economic damage from nonnative pests is not yet fully known, but is likely in the billions of dollars per year, with the majority of this economic burden borne by municipalities and residential property owners. Current policies for preventing introductions are having positive effects but are insufficient to reduce the influx of pests in the face of burgeoning global trade. Options are available to strengthen the defenses against pest arrival and establishment, including measures taken in the exporting country prior to shipment, measures to ensure clean shipments of plants and wood products, inspections at ports of entry, and post-entry measures such as quarantines, surveillance, and eradication programs. Improved data collection procedures for inspections, greater data accessibility, and better reporting would support better evaluation of policy effectiveness. Lack of additional action places the nation, local municipalities, and property owners at high risk of further damaging and costly invasions. Adopting stronger policies to reduce establishments of new forest insects and diseases would shift the major costs of control to the source and alleviate the economic burden now borne by homeowners and municipalities.																		1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000379603900012	27755760

The 16S rDNA sequencing of 79 selected isolates gave the final species-specific identification of strains. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that microbiota isolated from five different sources were represented with 29 species within three different phyla, Firmicutes with 25 species, Actinobacteria with only one species and Proteobacteria with three species of Enterobacteriaceae. Bacterial biodiversity presented with Shannon-Wiener index (H') was highest in the alimentary tract of adults and old bee bread (H' = 2.43 and H' = 2.53, respectively) and in the same time no dominance of any species was scored. On the contrary, results obtained for Simpson index (D) showed that in pollen samples the dominant species was Pantoea agglomerans (D = 0.42) while in fresh bee bread that was Staphylococcus sp. (D = 0.27). We assume that microbial diversity detected in the tested samples of solitary bee O. cornuta probably come from environment.																		0007-4853	1475-2670		WOS:000360286600012	25895542

Two of these, Bombus terrestris and B. hortorum, are common in Europe whilst two, B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus, have experienced declines, and the latter is now extinct in the UK. The presence of these species in New Zealand presents an opportunity to study their ecology in a contrasting environment. Forage visits made by bumblebees in New Zealand were recorded across a season. Ninety-six percent of visits were to six non-native forage plants (Cirsium vulgare, Echium vulgare, Hypericum perforatum, Lotus corniculatus, Lupinus polyphyllus and Trifolium pratense). All but L. polyphyllus are European plant species, and three are noxious weeds in New Zealand. Several of these plants have decreased in abundance in the UK, providing a potential explanation for the declines of B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus in Britain. In contrast to studies conducted elsewhere, B. ruderatus, B. terrestris and B. hortorum did not differ in diet breadth and overlap in forage use was high, probably due to the reduced diversity of bumblebee forage plants present in New Zealand. Diel partitioning of forage use between the species was observed, with foraging activity of B. hortorum greatest in the morning and evening, B. ruderatus greatest in the middle of the day and B. terrestris intermediate between the two. These patterns correspond to the climatic preferences of each species as evidenced by their geographic ranges. Implications for bumblebee conservation in the UK are discussed.																		1366-638X			WOS:000284073800003

(Hymenoptera: Apidae) and the mason bee Osmia cornuta (Latreille) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), as carriers of biocontrol agents (BCA) from flower to flower (secondary colonisation) was investigated on apple cv 'Golden Delicious'. The BCA tested was Bacillus subtilis, strain BD170 (BioproA (R)) developed for the control of the 'fire blight' caused by Erwinia amylovora (Burril) Winslow et al. The two insect species were studied as secondary BCA carriers on apple plants in pots under net screened tunnels. Their behaviour and capacity to deposit the BCA in the most receptive flower parts were compared both by washing, diluting and plating the flower organs on a recovery medium and by means of PCR analyses based on a molecular marker. O. cornuta showed better performances with respect to A. mellifera. For the field trials, pollinators were introduced in four apple orchards. During apple's flowering, the BD170 (100 g hl(-l)) was sprayed once in two fields, and twice in the others. The pollinators' efficacy in carrying the BCA from sprayed flowers to the stigmas of newly opened ones at different times after the spray treatment was evaluated. The detection of the BCA was performed by PCR analysis. The percentages of positive PCR flower samples were higher in the internal treated areas of the fields with respect to the external untreated ones, but the high colonisation level found in the latter and in the flowers opened in both areas several days after the treatment(s) demonstrated that pollinators can play an important role as secondary carriers.																		1386-6141	1573-8248		WOS:000262123000014

What is relatively unknown is how different landscapes influence foraging decisions, and whether habitat alteration, such as that resulting from urbanization, influences broad-scale foraging activities of bees. This study evaluates the type and diversity of pollen collected by two solitary bees that are common in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the native Osmia pumila and the exotic O. caerulescens, sampled in trap nests set up in urban parks and gardens. We found that the dominant pollen in every successful brood cell was either of one widespread, cosmopolitan lawn-invasive plant species (Trifolium repens) or one of two wind-pollinated tree genera (Quercus spp. and Betula spp.). In combination, these three represented more than 90 % of all pollen collected by each bee species. Despite considerable overlap in the dominant pollen types collected by each bee species, the exotic O. caerulescens was significantly more specialized than the native O. pumila. Brood cells with Betula as the dominant pollen type were more pollen species-rich than those cells having Trifolium or Quercus as dominant, perhaps a result of the comparatively low protein content in Betula pollen.																		1083-8155	1573-1642		WOS:000332698500009

The only previous assessment of the conservation status of the individual species was not based on recent collections. Here I report on conservation status of all known species, based on collections made from 1999 to 2002. Species are arranged into Six categories according to degree of threat, and species considered to be threatened are discussed individually. Five species have not been collected recently from one or more islands from which they are historically known, seven are restricted to endangered habitat, 10 are considered to be very rare and potentially endangered, and 10 have not been collected recently and could be extinct. With such a high proportion of rare species and the importance of Hylaeus species as pollinators, further work on their ecology is needed.																		0030-8870			WOS:000244434800001

Including the reports of others, the bee is in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, and Alabama. We also found it in southern Ontario, which is the first Canadian record. Its host plants include Koelreuteria paniculata, Sophora japonica, Ligustrum lucidum, Ligustrum vulgare, Oxydendrum arboreum, Catalpa speciosa, Lathyrus latlifolius, Lythrum salicaria, Buddleia spp., Vitex spp., and Asclepias spp. When foraging on L. latifolius and S. japonica, M. sculpturalis sometimes punctures the standard petal with its mandibles, leaving a distinctive mark that is useful for surveys. Over half of the host plants reported here originate from Asia, which is also the native range of M. sculpturalis. Perhaps this favorable foraging environment has, in part, aided the establishment and spread of M. sculpturalis in the United States.																		0022-8567	1937-2353		WOS:000220049300021

The objective of the study was to determine the species composition and relative abundance of the insects that visited yellow starthistle throughout the flowering season and to assess the pollen loads on their bodies in order to infer which species might be the most effective pollinators of this invasive plant species in north-eastern Oregon. A total of 1923 individual flower visitors were collected at the six sites over the 3 year study period, comprising four orders, 41 families, and 203 species of insects. The 20 most commonly collected species represented nearly 59% of the individuals and just ten of these species could be considered the key pollinators, judging by the combination of abundance and pollen carriage (the megachilids, Megachile apicalis (introduced) and Megachile perihirta, the apids, Apis mellifera (introduced), Bombus bifarius, Bombus centralis, Svastra obliqua, and Melissodes lutalenta, the halictids, Halictus tripartitus and Halictus ligatus, and the tachinid, Peleteria malleola. Over the 3 year study period, the six sites were consistently distinct in their flower visitor fauna, with the metropolitan Pendleton sites having a species composition distinct from the four mountain sites. Consistent patterns of interannual variation also were observed over the 3 year study. These patterns of flower visitation are interpreted in the context of the plant community within which yellow starthistle grows in north-eastern Oregon.																		1444-6162			WOS:000266074000006

This study was conducted to determine the effect of C. krombeini on mortality of male and female Osmia cornifrons, the Japanese hornfaced bee. A total of 107 O. cornifrons nests were examined to determine within-nest distribution of C. krombeini with regression analyses. A total of 30 mite-free O. cornifrons nests were observed and within-nest distribution of male and female O. cornifrons was determined with non-linear regression analyses. In addition, cocoons from 20 mite-infested O. cornifrons cells were examined to determine whether C. krombeini could be found inside cocoons of O. cornifrons. The results of this study showed that female O. cornifrons and C. krombeini were found more frequently in the inner part of the nest, and male O. cornifrons were found mostly in the center of the nest. No C. krombeini were found inside O. cornifrons cocoons. These results indicate that C. krombeini have a greater negative impact on mortality in the egg and larval stages of female O. cornifrons than in male O. cornifrons. Implications for management of C. krombeini and O. cornifrons populations for orchard pollination are discussed in this article.																		0168-8162	1572-9702		WOS:000318497000003	23100109

Evaluation of Native Bees as Pollinators of Cucurbit Crops Under Floating Row Covers								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				43	5			1354	1363		10.1603/EN13076				OCT 2014	2014	Production of cucurbit crops presents growers with numerous challenges. Several severe pests and diseases can be managed through the use of rotation, trap cropping, mechanical barriers, such as row covers, and chemical applications. However, considerations must also be made for pollinating insects, as adequate pollination affects the quantity and quality of fruit. Insecticides may negatively affect pollinators; a concern enhanced in recent years due to losses in managed Apis melifera L. colonies. Row covers can be used in place of chemical control before pollination, but when removed, pests have access to fields along with the pollinators. If pollination services of native bees could be harnessed for use under continuous row covers, both concerns could be balanced for growers. The potential of two bee species which specialize on cucurbit flowers, Peponapis pruinosa Say and Xenoglossa strenua Cresson, were assessed under continuous row covers, employed over acorn squash. Experimental treatments included plots with either naturally or artificially introduced bees under row covers and control plots with row covers either permanently removed at crop flowering, or employed continuously with no added pollinating insects. Pests in plots with permanently removed row covers were managed using standard practices used in certified organic production. Marketable yields from plots inoculated with bees were indistinguishable from those produced under standard practices, indicating this system would provide adequate yields to growers without time and monetary inputs of insecticide applications. Additionally, application of this technique was investigated for muskmelon production and discussed along with considerations for farm management.																		0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000343216400024	25199100

We found a significant non-random plant association among non-native bumble bee species and non-native plant species. Because of the distributional overlap between B. dahlbomii with the two non-native bee species, it is likely that B. dahlbomii interacts with these non-native bees.																		0021-8839	2078-6913		WOS:000287335500002

Bombus ruderatus and Bombus terrestris were sequentially introduced into Chile and later entered Argentina's Patagonian region. A large-scale survey in Patagonia reveals that, in 5 years post-arrival, the highly invasive B terrestris has become the most abundant and widespread Bombus species, and its southward spread is concurrent with the geographic retraction of the only native species, Bombus dahlbomii. Furthermore, a 20-year survey of pollinators of the endemic herb Alstroemeria aurea in northern Patagonia indicates that B ruderatus and B terrestris have replaced B dahlbomii, formerly the most abundant pollinator. Although the decline's underlying mechanisms remain unknown, the potential roles of exploitative competition and pathogen co-introduction cannot be ruled out. Given that invasive bumble bees can rapidly extirpate native congeners, further introductions should be discouraged.																		1540-9295	1540-9309		WOS:000327420800007

Concern has been expressed that it might act as an invasive species with large impact on biodiversity. However, although the honeybee has spread into the wild and has established feral populations in Australia and the Americas, the extent to which introduced honeybees alter biodiversity remains controversial. Here we focus on the best documented cases of A. mellifera invasions and discuss the effects on biodiversity under three different conditions: 1) regions where other subspecies of A. mellifera are endemic (Europe, Africa, and western Asia), 2) regions where A. mellifera is not endemic, but other species of Apis naturally occur (central and eastern Asia), 3) regions where Apis species are not endemic (America, Australia). Although some studies show an impact on native bee survival, fecundity, or population density in response to large A. mellifera aggregations (e.g., on apiaries), there are no reports that feral honeybees caused the extinction of native bee pollinators, which are the most likely competing group of organisms. Honeybee introductions have had or still may have negative effects only within the genus Apis, primarily interfering with beekeeping activities. Although honeybee invasions seem to have had little if any effect on biodiversity of native pollinators so far, we nevertheless caution against transporting honeybees around the globe, and we particularly advise against importing foreign Apis species into tropical ecosystems.																		1195-6860	2376-7626		WOS:000232582200002

In the past decades it has been accidentally introduced by man to East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where the species established sustainable and expanding populations. Recently it has also been introduced to Aqaba and Eilat, where it has also established expanding populations. We here study the genetic structure of this invasive population with nine microsatellite DNA markers to reconstruct the invasion history. The population shows indications of an extreme bottleneck suggesting that it established itself very recently and may have originated from a single introduced colony only.

Features across landscapes that are important for pollination delivery include: nesting habitats, floral resource availability at foraging distance, and climate. The conditions for presence/absence of pollinators are therefore complex and rely upon a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. To date there has been no easily available method for landowners to determine the potential of pollination delivery across the land effectively and rapidly. In this paper we develop a method that uses freely available datasets to remotely estimate the relative provision of pollination service delivery provided by bees across Europe at a 300 m-pixel resolution. We then identify the potential pollination delivery and efficiency across Europe at country and regional level. This study illustrates an approach that obtains a first approximation for land managers to identify potential areas across landscapes to protect in order to enhance pollination service delivery.

Xylocopa tranquebarorum, a large species of carpenter bee that nests in bamboo shoots, was introduced into Japan approximately 5 years ago and, along with its specifically associated mite, has established populations in Toyota and Nagoya in Aichi Prefecture and Anpachi in Gifu Prefecture. Because X. tranquebarorum only nests in dead bamboo shoots and because its associated mite differs from the mite species associated with X. tranquebarorum in Taiwan but is morphologically similar to the species described in India, Indonesia, and China, we suspect that X. tranquebarorum and its mite were introduced via processed bamboo shoots from continental Asia. Because the most probable pathway of associated microorganisms is host introduction, biological and ecological information, such as an inventory of symbionts, is crucial to avoid the risk of invasive symbiotic microorganisms. Although X tranquebarorum may become a pest in the bamboo industry if its distribution is expanded by human transport, its associated mite is suspected to be of low risk as house dust but to have a high contamination risk for the Japanese endemic mite, Sennertia alfkeni, associated with native Japanese carpenter bees.																		0003-6862			WOS:000280168600014

Because of their more restricted range of host plants, it maybe expected that specialists exist in smaller, more isolated populations, with lower effective population sizes than generalists. Consequently, we hypothesized that oligolectic bees have reduced levels of genetic variation relative to related polylectic species. To test this hypothesis, we used five phylogenetically independent pairs of species in which one member was oligolectic and the other was polylectic. We assayed genetic variation in our species pairs at an average of 32 allozyme loci. Within each species pair, the oligolectic member had fewer polymorphic loci, lower average allelic richness, and lower average expected heterozygosity than its polylectic relative. Averaged over all species pairs, this corresponds to a 21% reduction in allelic richness, a 72% reduction in the proportion of polymorphic loci, and an 83% reduction in expected heterozygosity in specialists compared with generalists. Our data support the hypothesis of reduced effective population size in oligolectic bees and suggest that they may be more prone to extinction as a result. We suggest that in instances in which bee specialists are involved in mutually codependent relationships with their floral hosts, these mutualisms may be endangered for genetic and ecological reasons.																		0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000226438600025

The introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) is an example of a species that can compete with native bees for floral resources. Often, research into honey bee/native bee competition has focused on floral resource overlap, visitation rates or resource harvesting, and any negative interaction has been interpreted as a negative impact. Although this research can be valuable in indicating the potential for competition between honey bees and native bees, to determine if the long-term survival of a native bee species is threatened, fecundity, survival or population density needs to be assessed. The present review evaluates research that has investigated all these measurements of honey bee/native bee competition and finds that many studies have problems with sample size, confounding factors or data interpretation. Guidelines for future research include increasing replication and using long-term studies to investigate the impact of both commercial and feral honey bees.																		1442-9985	1442-9993		WOS:000223057500005

A comparison was made by field-cage studies of American and Spanish populations of M. pacifica (Panzer) and an American population of M. concinna Smith. Significant differences included the following. Spanish M. pacifica showed the lowest mortality in immature stages (9%). M. concinna built about 4 times as many cells as the other bees, and was the most successful in rearing F2 adults; seed production was also highest in the M. concinna cages. It is important on economic grounds that the possibilities of rearing other alfalfa pollinators than M. pacifica should be explored further.																		0021-8839			BCI:BCI197764001665

Here we examine nest site selection in the solitary, resource defense polygynous bee, Anthidium manicatum. Using a wood-framed screen enclosure outfitted with food sources, nesting materials, and bamboo trap nests, we show that female bees prefer to initiate nests in sites located high above the ground. We also show that nest sites located at higher levels are less likely to contain spiderwebs, suggesting an adaptive explanation for nest site height preferences. We report size differences between this study's source populations in Boston, Massachusetts and Brooklyn, New York; male bees collected in Boston have smaller mean head widths than males collected in Brooklyn. Finally, we argue that methods for studying captive populations of A. manicatum hold great promise for research into sexual selection, alternative phenotypes, recognition systems, and the evolution of nesting behavior.																		0044-8435			WOS:000291362700007

We examined the potential pollination of this orchid by the recently naturalized orchid bee (Euglossa viridissima), recorded as a pollinator of the orchid in tropical America, and found that this orchid bee is not a pollinator of the plant. We sought to learn what is responsible for relatively heavy fruit set in a Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden population of C. punctatum, and determined that the native oil-collecting bee, Centris errans, is the most important pollinator. C. punctatum flowers at Fairchild have 18 times the fruit set of flowers in Everglades National Park. The difference is probably due to the many species and individuals of oil-reward plants in the Malpighiaceae in the garden, compared to one uncommon native species in the park. Female C. errans visit these oil-reward flowers to obtain edible oils to provision their brood. Cyrtopodium flowers appear to mimic the oil-reward flowers of the Malpighiaceae to attract Centris bee pollinators, much as many Oncidium orchids do in tropical America. We recommend that Brysonima lucida, a rare native mal-pighiaceous shrub, and C. punctatum be planted together in Everglades National Park and other natural areas to attempt to increase C. errans pollination, to restore and enhance the long-term survival of the orchid. Planting model malpighiaceous plants to enhance Centris bee pollination may be a useful restoration tactic for other rare orchid mimics in the American tropics, including Atlantic Forest in Brazil.

Orchid bees don't need orchids: Evidence from the naturalization of an orchid bee in Florida								ECOLOGY				87	8			1995	2001		10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1995:OBDNOE]2.0.CO;2				AUG 2006	2006	Almost 200 species of orchid bees are the exclusive pollinators of nearly 700 specialized orchids in the neotropics. This well-known mutualism involves orchids, called perfume orchids, which produce species-specific blends of. oral fragrances, and male orchid bees, which collect and use these fragrance compounds during their courtship. We report here the naturalization of an orchid bee, Euglossa viridissima, in southern Florida, USA, where perfume orchids are absent. Chemical analysis of the contents of the fragrance storage organs in the hind tibias of 59 male bees collected in Florida identified 55 fragrance compounds, including 27 known from the perfumes of nine species of E. viridissima's orchid mutualists in Mesoamerica. Aromatic leaves, such as basil, were found to be important surrogate sources of needed fragrance compounds in Florida. The bee's ability to live and become abundant in the absence of its orchid mutualists suggests that the orchid bee-perfume orchid mutualism may be facultative for the bees, even though it is obligatory for the orchids. This invasive bee visits and potentially pollinates the flowers of many plants in Florida, behavior that could promote the abundance of selected exotic and native species.																		0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000239833400017	16937639

Non-native prey should have a neutral to positive effect on native predators by supplementing the prey base. However, if non-native prey displace native prey, then an invader's net influence should depend on both its abundance and value relative to native prey. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the effect of non-native prey on native predator populations. Relative to native prey, non-native prey similarly or negatively affect native predators, but only when studies employed a substitutive design that examined the effects of each prey species in isolation from other prey. When native predators had access to non-native and native prey simultaneously, predator abundance increased significantly relative to pre-invasion abundance. Although non-native prey may have a lower per capita value than native prey, they seem to benefit native predators by serving as a supplemental prey resource.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000362915600004	26303824

(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), was examined with microscopy to determine the structure and arrangement of the gland in the sting apparatus. The appearance and relative size of the Dufour's gland of these two bee species are similar. Unlike the termination of the Dufour's gland at the base of the sting in the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (Apidae), the posterior portion of the Dufour's gland in these megachilids enters into the sting bulb along with the venom duct. Within the sting bulb, the Dufour's gland is ventral to and longer than the venom duct. The following evidential findings presented here and elsewhere are in support of the hypothesis that the Dufour's gland is the source of an individual nest recognition cue in these two bee species: 1) the presence of a duct and exit pore at the posterior end of the Dufour's gland that may release glandular secretions, 2) the location of thick, brushy metasomal setae and the setosa membrane that could be used to apply a secretion to a substrate, and 3) the observed dragging of the tip of the abdomen during nest-marking.																		0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000299020500014

Nest management of this Eurasian nonsocial pollinator transformed the alfalfa seed industry in North America, tripling seed production. The most common ALCB management practice is the loose cell system, in which cocooned bees are removed from nesting cavities for cleaning and storage. Traits of ALCBs that favored their commercialization include gregarious nesting; use of leaves for lining nests; ready acceptance of affordable, mass-produced nesting materials; alfalfa pollination efficacy; and emergence synchrony with alfalfa bloom. The ALCB became a commercial success because much of its natural history was understood, targeted research was pursued, and producer ingenuity was encouraged. The ALCB presents a model system for commercializing other solitary bees and for advancing new testable hypotheses in diverse biological disciplines.																		0066-4170	1545-4487	978-0-8243-0156-9	WOS:000286841900012	20809804

ECOLOGY				89	3			795	804		10.1890/07-0751.1				MAR 2008	2008	Bees require large amounts of pollen for their own reproduction. While several morphological flower traits are known to have evolved to protect plants against excessive pollen harvesting by bees, little is known on how selection to minimize pollen loss acts on the chemical composition of pollen. In this study, we traced the larval development of four solitary bee species, each specialized on a different pollen source, when reared on non-host pollen by transferring unhatched eggs of one species onto the pollen provisions of another species. Pollen diets of Asteraceae and Ranunculus ( Ranunculaceae) proved to be inadequate for all bee species tested except those specialized on these plants. Further, pollen of Sinapis ( Brassicaceae) and Echium ( Boraginaceae) failed to support larval development in one bee species specialized on Campanula ( Campanulaceae). Our results strongly suggest that pollen of these four taxonomic groups possess protective properties that hamper digestion and thus challenge the general view of pollen as an easy-to-use protein source for flower visitors.																		0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000254678200020	18459342

Early nesting biology of the wood-nesting adventive bee, Lithurgus chrysurus Fonscolombe (Apoidea: Megachilidae: Lithurginae)								AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES					3804			1	12						MAY 22 2014	2014	This, the second study of the nesting biology of Lithurgus chrysurus Fonscolombe found at Palmerton, Carbon Co., Pennsylvania, describes its nest construction, provisioning, egg deposition, and larval development. The first study (Rozen, 2013) was based on observations on the late-stage nesting biology in early fall, when these activities were no longer being performed. Comparisons are made with activities of the native Lithurgopsis apicalis (Cresson); in general, the two species have similar, but not identical, nesting biologies. Because Lithurgus chrysurus is an adventive bee native to the Mediterranean regions and is capable of constructing nests in both soft wood as well as firmer wood, it is unclear why it has not expanded its range to any great extent in the New World.																		0003-0082	1937-352X		WOS:000336419200001

Lithurgus chrysurus is univoltine and over-winter as prepupae inside cocoons. The females excavate their own burrows in various dead woods and they do not reuse burrows. The cells are separated by partitions composed of cut wood pieces. To assess the diet breadth of L. chrysurus, pollen analyses were conducted on 8 samples of provisions from 3 nests and 2 feces samples from one nest. The provisions averaged 30,600 pollen grains per mg of dry matter. The proportion of broken pollen grains averaged 3.3% and was consistent among nests and for provisions and feces. Centaurea (Asteraceae, tribe Cynareae) was the dominant pollen type found in all provisions and feces, accounting for 98.0 to 99.9% of the pollen based on the number of grains. This proportion was similar among nests for both provisions and feces. These results indicate that, at the study site, L. chrysurus was strictly oligolectic on Centaurea pollen while nectar was probably collected on other plant species as well.																		0022-8567			WOS:000223187300011

The nectar-rewarding orchid Brachystele unilateralis and the nectarless and deceit-pollinated Chloraea virescens are restricted to the Southern Andes, where a single native and endemic bumblebee (Bombus dahlbomii) occured until the introduction of honeybees and highly invasive European bumblebees. Here, we describe the floral features, breeding system, pollinator activity and fruiting success of these orchid species. Both are self-compatible but pollinator-dependent, i.e., unable to set fruit and seed in the absence of pollinators. Field observations revealed that most of their current reproductive success is due to the introduced Bombus terrestris, Bombus ruderatus and Apis mellifera bees. The only native pollinator recorded was B. dahlbomii, but this bee was rarely observed due to its steady decline since the introduction of the alien Bombus species. The observed natural fruiting success per inflorescence in both studied species proved to be remarkably high by orchid standards: 83% and 66%, respectively. These results suggest that sexual reproduction in these orchids is not necessarily threatened by the decline of their native pollinator since pollination is successfully achieved by introduced bees. This provides a plausible better outlook for these and other regional, bumblebee-pollinated orchids and raises caution on eventual conservation policies involving the management of these introduced bee species. To our knowledge, this is the first report of native orchid pollinators being effectively replaced by invasive bumblebees and, furthermore, the first description of the pollination biology of a species of Bra chystele.

In some cases, however, they can also provide conservation benefits. We examined the ways in which non-native species currently contribute to conservation objectives. These include, for example, providing habitat or food resources to rare species, serving as functional substitutes for extinct taxa, and providing desirable ecosystem functions. We speculate that non-native species might contribute to achieving conservation goals in the future because they may be more likely than native species to persist and provide ecosystem services in areas where climate and land use are changing rapidly and because they may evolve into new and endemic taxa. The management of non-native species and their potential integration into conservation plans depends on how conservation goals are set in the future. A fraction of non-native species will continue to cause biological and economic damage, and substantial uncertainty surrounds the potential future effects of all non-native species. Nevertheless, we predict the proportion of non-native species that are viewed as benign or even desirable will slowly increase over time as their potential contributions to society and to achieving conservation objectives become well recognized and realized.																		0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000290491700005	21342267

A novel mutualism between an ant-plant and its resident pollinator								NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN				95	1			61	65		10.1007/s00114-007-0289-0				JAN 2008	2008	Pollination systems in which the host plant provides breeding sites for pollinators, invariably within flowers, are usually highly specialized mutualisms. We found that the pollinating bee Braunsapis puangensis breeds within the caulinary domatia of the semi-myrmecophyte Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae), an unusual ant-plant that is polymorphic for the presence of domatia and harbours a diverse invertebrate fauna including protective and non-protective ants in its domatia. B. puangensis is the most common flower visitor that carries the highest proportion of H. brunonis pollen. This myrmecophyte is pollen limited and cross-pollinated by bees in the daytime. Hence, the symbiotic pollinator could provide a benefit to trees bearing domatia by alleviating this limitation. We therefore report for the first time an unspecialised mutualism in which a pollinator is housed in a plant structure other than flowers. Here, the cost to the plant is lower than for conventional brood-site pollination mutualisms where the pollinator develops at the expense of plant reproductive structures. Myrmecophytes housing resident pollinators are unusual, as ants are known to be enemies of pollinators, and housing them together may decrease the benefits that these residents could individually provide to the host plant.																		0028-1042	1432-1904		WOS:000251321600007	17657468

This solitary bee is the only representative in the Western Hemisphere of the Old World genus Lithurgus, and likely a conspecific with the Indo-Australian species Lithurgus atratus. L. huberi appears to have reached the continent at least 100 years ago, when it was discovered and described. Because this species seems to be oligolectic on pollen of Convolvulaceae flowers in South America, we attempted to integrate this biotic interaction (plant-bee relationships) to our species distribution model (SDM) procedures to predict its potential distribution in South America. The modeled distribution of seven L. huberi's host plant species did not improve the algorithms' ability to predict its distribution, but it produced constrained ranges. These results suggest that our biotic variables are not independent of the abiotic variables used (mostly related to climate). We employed five modeling algorithms, Envelope Score, GARP, Mahalanobis Distance, Support Vector Machines, and MaxEnt, but only the former two showed a good performance when predicting the occurrence of both, the host plant species and L. huberi. Our results indicate that this exotic pollinator is mainly distributed in eastern, northeastern, central, and southwestern South America, with few suitable areas in the Amazon region. We also highlight suitable areas for future surveys and present new occurrence records. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																		0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:000331673800019

Pollination is a critical ecosystem function with high ecological and economic value. Conservation initiatives aimed at protecting diverse pollinator communities in natural and agricultural habitats are essential, but the implementation and success of such initiatives often depends on public support.2. Mass media play an important role in building public awareness around environmental issues, and biased coverage can have damaging effects. Here, we present the first analysis of how Australian mainstream media present the 'pollinator' paradigm. We gathered insect pollinator and pollination related articles from major Australian online newspapers published over a period of 9 years, and performed a qualitative content analysis using deductive coding to record information on the pollinator species or groups discussed in the story.3. We found 151 stories, and demonstrate that within these, there was a disproportionate focus on introduced European honey bees as the most important, or only, pollinator insect relevant to Australia. Only 15% of stories mentioned native bees as pollinators and 17% mentioned non-bee pollinators.4. There is potential that the trend we report here for pollinators may be indicative of a larger overall simplification and neglect of biodiversity concepts in mainstream media, both in Australia and globally. As public awareness of science and environmental issues partly depend on disseminating accurate information beyond the scholar network, it is imperative that the broader effects of inaccurate science communication are fully understood.																		1752-458X	1752-4598		WOS:000382494700002

We assess whether establishment of this wool-carder bee presents potential risks to native flora and fauna by recording its current distribution, which plant species it visits, which insects co-occur at these plants, and identifying which species this territorial bee attacks. Anthidium manicatum is now widespread in urban New Zealand. More than 80% of the plants visited by A. manicatum were exotic species (predominantly Lamiaceae and Plantaginaceae), although it also visited native species of Veronica (Plantaginaceae) and Lobelia (Campanulaceae). Anthidium manicatum primarily interacted with other introduced bees. Native Lasioglossum bees were seldom attacked and only for short durations. Further research is required, particularly on weeds, but we suggest that A. manicatum does not present a major direct threat to New Zealand's native flora and fauna.																		0028-825X			WOS:000323274300007

Quantitative reference samples totalling more than 4000 items were collected from flowers at the same site over a period of four years. These data give a uniquely detailed view of the way in which a generalist predator exploits a diverse prey community. Most species show striking year-to-year variation in relative abundance, in both the prey and reference collections, but the overall abundances of species tend to be similar in the two collections, as do their sex ratios. This shows: (i) that P. sanbornii takes virtually every bee and wasp species found at flowers during its flight season (except for the relatively small number of species too large to handle); (ii) that prey are taken at rates roughly proportional to their local abundances (with a few exceptions); and (iii) that the local bee and wasp communities have lively dynamics (at least on spatial scales equivalent to the flight ranges of P. sanbornii females). Prey species are non-randomly distributed among nests of individual females within years, and among cells within nests, in a pattern suggesting that females often return repeatedly to hunting sites at which they have had success; the pattern does not suggest that individual females develop preferences for particular prey taxa. The size-abundance distributions of female bees appear to be trimodal at both the individual and species levels, most strongly so when cleptoparasitic species are removed from the sample. Such patterns are seen weakly or not at all in the size-abundance distributions of male bees, male wasps, and female wasps. Bees and wasps of both sexes visit flowers for nectar, but only non-parasitic female bees harvest pollen; this suggests that the multimodality may be caused by aspects of pollen collection that tend to scale with size. The seven Philanthus species of eastern North America vary greatly in size, but they share a common set of relatively small prey species. As in other parts of North America, larger species of Philanthus tend to have relatively broad diets because they also take larger prey that are not available to their smaller congeners. However, long-tongued bees appear to be under-represented in the diets of most North American Philanthus outside the zebratus species group.																		0962-8436			WOS:A1993KW42000003	8098871

We studied their biology and behavior in relation to weather and the availability of alternate forage plants to determine if they have potential as pollinators of lowbush blueberry, Vaccinium spp. In 1991 O. ribifloris foraged at temperatures ranging from 10-23-degrees-C, in winds up to 24.1 km/hr, and light intensities lower than 4 watts/m2. Pollen provisions were exclusively Vaccinium, adult activity period was well synchronized with bloom, and it overwintered in the field and laboratory successfully. In 1992 M. rotundata foraged at 13.5-23-degrees-C, in winds up to 25.7 km/hr, and light intensities down to 163 watts/m2. The percentage of Vaccinium in provisions varied depending on the availability of alternate forage plants. Adult activity extended beyond blueberry bloom. It overwintered successfully in the laboratory. Both species expressed potential as lowbush blueberry pollinators. Given its fidelity to Vaccinium, O. ribifloris appears suitable in all fields, including those with abundant and diverse alternate forage plants. Megachile rotundata appears more suitable for fields relatively devoid of other food resources during blueberry bloom.																		0022-8567			WOS:A1994PQ49500004

Ecosistemas				23	3			58	66		10.7818/ECOS.2014.23-3.08				2014	2014	Each spring, the introduction of up to 3000 beehives is permitted in the Teide National Park (Tenerife, Canary Islands). This introduction implies that around 100 million Apis mellifera (Apidae) bees compete with the native fauna (insects, but also birds and lizards) for floral resources (nectar/pollen). Since A. mellifera is not considered an effective pollinator (qualitatively), its massive presence can also reduce fruit and seed production, and the viability and vigour of seeds and seedlings by inbreeding depression. We document the ecological consequences of massive honeybee introduction on the native pollination network of this protected area (with a high frequency of Canarian endemic species) and we also review examples worldwide about their impact on insular flora and fauna. Our results indicate that both the structure and functionality of the pollination network were negatively, and significantly affected under the massive presence of A. mellifera. When beehives were installed into the Park, the diversity of native flower visitors decreased. Besides, the reproductive performance of highly visited plant species by honeybees (Echium wildpretii and Spartocytisus supranubius) was significantly reduced. According to these results, we recommend the complete suppression of introduced beehives in Teide National Park in order to protect its endemic flora and fauna.																		1697-2473			CABI:20153184965

We used perturbation analysis of stage-structured projection matrices to evaluate the efficacy of seasonally operated barriers and fishways for controlling non-native sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in the Laurentian Great Lakes while minimizing effects on non-target fishes. For non-jumping fishes migrating in spring, seasonally operated barriers without a fishway will not balance the management objectives satisfactorily. Migration phenologies of the seven common non-target fishes considered in our analyses overlapped considerably with the migration phenology of sea lamprey, with peaks in migration typically being 7-43 days (median 12) from the peak in the sea lamprey migration. Consequently, across species, years, and tributaries, 44-100% of the migratory runs of non-target fishes would be blocked under the 75-day operation period required to block 99% of the sea lamprey spawning run, on average. Reductions in the production of nontarget fishes due to blocking were also projected to be similar in magnitude to reductions projected in the production of sea lamprey, unless density-dependent compensation was strong or overlap in migration phenologies between a non-target species and sea lamprey was low. Even under density-dependent compensation, providing a fishway is advisable and passage of non-target fishes may have to be highly effective to avoid population declines in non-jumping species that migrate between a Great Lake and its tributaries.

Yields after one single visit were more than five times higher in flowers visited by O. cornuta than in those visited by A. mellifera nectar gatherers. This is attributed to the lower rate of stigma contact in A. mellifera visits, rather than to insufficient deposition of compatible pollen when the stigmas are contacted. A. mellifera pollen collectors had very high rates of stigma contact, but they were very scarce (3%) on 'Delicious' flowers despite the presence of abundant brood in their hives. One single visit per newer by O. cornuta produced commercial fruit set (27.4%) and fruit size (>70 mm diameter). Based on cell production, average number of trips required to provision a male and a female cell, and flower visiting rates, it is estimated that a mean of 22,252 apple newer visits per female O. cornuta were made during the 15-d flowering period. This result indicates that 530 nesting O. cornuta females per hectare are enough to provide adequate apple pollination.																		0046-225X			WOS:000089623200014		
J	Wilson, RL; Abel, CA								Storage conditions for maintaining Osmia cornifrons (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) for use in germplasm pollination								JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY				69	3			270	272						JUL 1996	1996	In 1997, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) was introduced from Japan into the United States as an orchard pollinator. The bet is of interest to the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station because it is a highly efficient, cool season pollinator. We have need for early spring pollinators to possibly replace honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) for pollination of Brassica spp, in field cages. We tested four overwintering storage treatments (outdoors, in an unheated machine shed, in a 4-5 degrees C seed storage room, and in a 1-2 degrees C growth chamber) to determine the optimal winter storage conditions for diapausing adults. Storage in the 1-2 degrees C growth chamber resulted in the highest emergence of bees for three test dates (April, June, and August).																		0022-8567			WOS:A1996VW87900007		
J	Winfree, Rachael; Williams, Neal M.; Dushoff, Jonathan; Kremen, Claire								Native bees provide insurance against ongoing honey bee losses								ECOLOGY LETTERS				10	11			1105	1113		10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01110.x				NOV 2007	2007	One of the values of biodiversity is that it may provide 'biological insurance' for services currently rendered by domesticated species or technology. We used crop pollination as a model system, and investigated whether the loss of a domesticated pollinator (the honey bee) could be compensated for by native, wild bee species. We measured pollination provided to watermelon crops at 23 farms in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA, and used a simulation model to separate the pollen provided by honey bees and native bees. Simulation results predict that native bees alone provide sufficient pollination at > 90% of the farms studied. Furthermore, empirical total pollen deposition at flowers was strongly, significantly correlated with native bee visitation but not with honey bee visitation. The honey bee is currently undergoing extensive die-offs because of Colony Collapse Disorder. We predict that in our region native bees will buffer potential declines in agricultural production because of honey bee losses.																		1461-023X			WOS:000249882700010	17877737	
J	Woodward, DR								Monitoring for impact of the introduced leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (F) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), near release sites in South Australia								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY				35				187	191		10.1111/j.1440-6055.1996.tb01385.x				MAY 31 1996	1996	Native plants from remnant strip vegetation at roadside sites near Keith, South Australia were monitored during the period when leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata, were managed on nearby lucerne crops. The predominant native plants flowering at sampling sites during the November to March period included Melaleuca uncinata, Melaleuca lanceolata, Baeckia behrii and Bursaria spinosa. No M. rotundata were found on native vegetation. No M. rotundata prepupae were found in 12 microdomiciles placed in a nearby Conservation Park. The results of the monitoring program suggested feral leafcutting bee populations were unlikely to have established in significant numbers and the impact on the local plants and animals was negligible.																		1326-6756			WOS:A1996WC34600014
