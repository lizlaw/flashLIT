J	Aigner, PA								Ecological and genetic effects on demographic processes: pollination, clonality and seed production in Dithyrea maritima								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				116	1			27	34		10.1016/S0006-3207(03)00170-8				MAR 2004	2004	The relative importance of ecological and genetic factors in regulating the demographic processes of small populations is unknown for most rare plants. Dithyrea maritima (beach spectacle pod; Brassicaceae) is a rare, rhizomatously spreading, and self-incompatible herbaceous perennial endemic to coastal sand dunes of southern California. Low seed production in this species may be caused by insufficient pollinator visits, which may be exacerbated by competition for pollinator visits from non-native plants that have invaded the coastal dunes. I tested this 'ecological' hypothesis by removing flowers of Cakile maritima and Carpobrotus spp. from three experimental plots on San Nicolas Island. A second possible limitation on seed set is low diversity of genets within subpopulations, which could lead to scarcity of compatible mates. I tested this 'genetic' hypothesis by assigning ramets to clones using isozymes, and by relating clonal diversity within populations to seed set. Removal of non-native plants had no detectable effect on pollination service to D. maritima or on seed set, and seed set was unrelated to natural variation in pollination service among populations within a single year. In contrast, clonal diversity within a 10 m(2) patch was a strong predictor of seed set. Hence a genetic factor explains spatial variation in seed set on San Nicolas Island. On larger spatial and temporal scales, however, pollination service also affects patterns of seed set: a shift in pollination from flies in 1998 to bees in 1999 probably caused a corresponding increase in seed set across San Nicolas Island, while extremely low seed set at another site (San Miguel Island) is probably caused by a virtual absence of pollinators there.

Each of four study sites contained a tract of continuous forest, one large (> 2.2 ha) forest fragment, and one small (< 1 ha) fragment, with fragments isolated for 5-20 yr preceding the study. During its respective flowering peak each tree species examined, Prosopis nigra (Mimosoideae) and Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), dominated the sites' entomophilous flora.Results indicate that flower-visitor assemblages respond to landscape features on the scale of hectares; specifically, forest fragmentation in the Chaco Serrano leads to an insect flower-visitor fauna increasingly dominated by the exotic honey bee (Apis mellifera). Bees as a group made >90% of observed flower visits to both plant species. The honey bee alone made 82% of all visits to the early-flowering tree species P. nigra and 44% to the later flowering C australe. Frequency and taxon richness of native flower-visitors at both plant species declined with decreasing forest-fragment size, but frequency of honey bee visits tended to increase in complementary fashion, such that the total frequency of insect visits to flowers of either plant species varied little with fragment size. Frequencies of visits by honey bees and those by native insects were also negatively correlated across individual trees. In both plants, visits by native insects were most consistent (varied the least among plants or over time) in large forest tracts, whereas honey bee visits to C australe were most consistent in small fragments. In pan trap samples the relative frequency of honey bees increased with decreasing fragment size. Native flower-visitors sampled by pan traps increased in numbers and taxon richness both with increasing patch size and as spring progressed. Thus, fragmentation of the Chaco Serrano appears to (a) affect native flower-visitors adversely and to (b) facilitate honey bees' access to floral resources. It is not clear that these two effects are directly related to each other, however.																		1051-0761			WOS:A1994NH00100018

If invasive species integrate into mutualistic webs, they may alter web structure, with consequences for species persistence. However, the effect of alien mutualists on the architecture of plant - pollinator webs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the extent of mutual dependency between interacting species, as a measure of mutualism strength, and the connectivity of 10 paired plant - pollinator webs, eight from forests of the southern Andes and two from oceanic islands, with different incidences of alien species. Highly invaded webs exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded webs. This potential increase in network stability was the result of a disproportionate increase in the importance and participation of alien species in the most asymmetric interactions. The integration of alien mutualists did not alter overall network connectivity, but links were transferred from generalist native species to super-generalist alien species during invasion. Therefore, connectivity among native species declined in highly invaded webs. These modifications in the structure of pollination webs, due to dominance of alien mutualists, can leave many native species subject to novel ecological and evolutionary dynamics.																		1544-9173	1545-7885		WOS:000254928400025	18271628

Ant and pollinator exclusion experiments elucidated both positive and negative effects of ant attendance on plant reproductive success, including pollination, fruit set, fruit loss, and fruit removal. Ants did not pollinate flowers but did contribute to higher pollination success, probably by increasing the relocation frequency of winged pollinators and thus the rate of flower visitation. Ants also prevented fruit loss to herbivorous insects which were common during the early stages of fruit development. Thus, ant attendance strongly improved both pollination and fruit set whereby plants with ants set more fruit per flower and also lost fewer fruits during fruit maturation. In contrast? ants had a negative effect on the removal of ripe fruits by avian frugivores. Thus, ant attendance has a non-trivial influence on plant reproduction, this interaction being beneficial at some stages of the plant reproductive cycle and carrying costs at another stage. A tight ecological or co-evolved relationship between these Ectatomma spp. and P. limonensis is unlikely given that ant attendance of plants is detrimental to fruit removal.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000081128300017	28307720

Evaluation of both sides of the mutualistic interaction will yield insights into the mechanisms behind species' responses to habitat fragmentation.																		0022-0477	1365-2745		WOS:000222869400015		
J	Barthell, JF; Randall, JM; Thorp, RW; Wenner, AM								Promotion of seed set in yellow star-thistle by honey bees: Evidence of an invasive mutualism								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				11	6			1870	1883		10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[1870:POSSIY]2.0.CO;2				DEC 2001	2001	We examined the role of nonnative honey bees (Apis mellifera) as pollinators of the invasive, nonnative plant species yellow star-thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), both introduced to the western United States in the early to middle 1800s. Using four different treatments (three exclosure types) at flower heads, we observed visitation rates of different pollinators. Honey bees were the most common visitors at each of three transects established at three study locales in California: University of California at Davis, Cosumnes River Preserve. and Santa Cruz Island. A significant correlation existed between honey bee visitation levels monitored in all these transects and the average number of viable seeds per seed head for the same transects. Selective exclusion of honey bees at flower heads using a 3 mm diameter mesh significantly reduced seed set per seed head at all locales. Seed set depression was less dramatic at the island locale because of high visitation rates by generalist halictid bees Augochlorella pomoniella and Agapostemon texanus that penetrated the 3-mm mesh. The introduced megachilid bee Megachile apicalis occurred at all three locales as well (though in much lower numbers) and may contribute to pollination. In an ancillary study, seed set of plants with bagged heads was compared with that of plants without any bagged heads to test for resource shunting effects. These results showed that seed set differences observed between treatments within a single plant were not exaggerated due to resource shunting induced by the bagging technique. Yellow star-thistle may have low or variable levels of self-compatibility (as reflected by low seed set levels in small-mesh bags), increasing the importance of pollination in its breeding system. These results suggest that honey bees and yellow star-thistle may act as invasive mutualists, an association that may extend to other normative plant and pollinator species from Eurasia.																		1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000172456700024

Two of the introduced bee species, Megachile apicalis Spinola and Megachile rotundata (F.), were frequent nest site occupants and accounted for 19.6 and 3.4% of all artificial nesting cavities (trap-nests) monitored during the 1st and 2nd yr of this study, respectively. These species were most active before and after the peak in native bee nesting activity and tended to occupy xeric habitats, despite significantly higher larval mortality associated with such environments. The ability to occupy a wide array of habitats may account for the invasion success of M. apicalis in California. Another invader, the European earwig, Forficula auricularia L., was a frequent occupant of nesting cavities in mesic habitats, accounting for 59 and 85% occupancy of trap-nests during the Ist and 2nd yr of the study, respectively. Exclusion experiments indicate earwig densities were sufficient to displace female bees at nest sites with 1/3 as much nesting activity occurring in sampling units that allowed entry by earwigs as those made inaccessible to them with sticky barriers. In comparison, all native species (including bees and wasps) never accounted for >25% of all occupied nesting cavities of either monitoring period of the study.																		0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000073520800009

They may affect pollinator visitation rates to native plants and modify the plant-pollinator interaction network. However, there is little information about the extent to which invasive pollen is incorporated into the pollination network and about the rates of invasive pollen deposition on the stigmas of native plants.Methods The degree of pollinator sharing between the invasive plant Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and the main co-flowering native plants was tested in a Mediterranean coastal shrubland. Pollen loads were identified from the bodies of the ten most common pollinator species and stigmatic pollen deposition in the five most common native plant species.Key Results It was found that pollinators visited Carpobrotus extensively. Seventy-three per cent of pollinator specimens collected on native plants carried Carpobrotus pollen. On average 23 % of the pollen on the bodies of pollinators visiting native plants was Carpobrotus. However, most of the pollen found on the body of pollinators belonged to the species on which they were collected. Similarly, most pollen on native plant stigmas was conspecific. Invasive pollen was present on native plant stigmas, but in low quantity.Conclusions Carpobrotus is highly integrated in the pollen transport network. However, the plant-pollination network in the invaded community seems to be sufficiently robust to withstand the impacts of the presence of alien pollen on native plant pollination, as shown by the low levels of heterospecific pollen deposition on native stigmas. Several mechanisms are discussed for the low invasive pollen deposition on native stigmas.																		0305-7364	1095-8290		WOS:000258471100013	18593688

However, there is little information available about the effect of introduced species on the structure of such networks. We compared uninvaded and invaded ecological communities, to examine how two species of invasive plants with large and showy flowers (Carpobrotus affine acinaciformis and Opuntia stricta) affect the structure of Mediterranean plant-pollinator networks. To attribute differences in pollination to the direct presence of the invasive species, areas were surveyed that contained similar native plant species cover, diversity and floral composition, with or without the invaders. Both invasive plant species received significantly more pollinator visits than any native species and invaders interacted strongly with pollinators. Overall, the pollinator community richness was similar in invaded and uninvaded plots, and only a few generalist pollinators visited invasive species exclusively. Invasive plants acted as pollination super generalists. The two species studied were visited by 43% and 31% of the total insect taxa in the community, respectively, suggesting they play a central role in the plant-pollinator networks. Carpobrotus and Opuntia had contrasting effects on pollinator visitation rates to native plants: Carpobrotus facilitated the visit of pollinators to native species, whereas Opuntia competed for pollinators with native species, increasing the nestedness of the plant-pollinator network. These results indicate that the introduction of a new species to a community can have important consequences for the structure of the plant-pollinator network.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000254238700010	18188603

Waggle dances of honey-bees (Apis mellifera L.) were decoded to determine where and how far the bees foraged during the blooming of heather (Calluna vulgaris L.) in August 1996 using a hive located in Sheffield, UK, east of the heather moors. The median distance foraged was 6.1 km, and the mean 5.5 km. Only 10% of the bees foraged within 0.5 km of the hive whereas 50% went more than 6 km, 25% more than 7.5 km and 10% more than 9.5 km from the hive.2. These results are in sharp contrast with previous studies in which foraging distances were much closer to the hive. In May 1997 the mean foraging distance was 1 km, showing that long-range dancing is not the rule in Sheffield.3. The observed foraging distances described in this study may not be exceptional in a patchy environment where differences in patch size and patch quality are large. When travel distances to patches are large, distant patches can probably be utilized only by individuals that live in groups and recruit foragers to the patches found. Only then are the benefits of scouting for distant patches high enough to enable the exploitation of these patches.																		0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000089054800011

By studying bee and hoverfly assemblages in Britain and the Netherlands, we found evidence of declines (pre- versus post-1980) in local bee diversity in both countries; however, divergent trends were observed in hoverflies. Depending on the assemblage and location, pollinator declines were most frequent in habitat and flower specialists, in univoltine species, and/or in nonmigrants. In conjunction with this evidence, outcrossing plant species that are reliant on the declining pollinators have themselves declined relative to other plant species. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a causal connection between local extinctions of functionally linked plant and pollinator species.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000239154300044	16857940

BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				138	1-2			1	12		10.1016/j.biocon.2007.04.015				AUG 2007	2007	A growing number of studies on naturally occurring plant species have shown that plantplant interactions for pollination vary from competitive to facilitative. In reviewing the seven published studies on how alien species can affect the pollination success in natives, we found that all authors suggest competitive effects to dominate, either through reduced pollinator visitation rates or through increased heterospecific pollination of native flowers. Although certain pollinator interactions were competitive, the reproductive output in the native species was not always reduced. This implies that natives are not pollen limited, and/or that they compensate for the loss of pollinators by other animals. However, the few studies on pollination interactions between alien and native plant species show differing results. We therefore discuss other properties that can cause aliens to be strong interactors for pollination, and can modify how alien species affect the reproductive success in natives. We also emphasize the spatial scales addressed in the reviewed studies, as alien plant species may represent valuable food resources for many pollinators. Such plant species tend to be interpreted as competitive plants for pollination, whereas we stress their facilitative ability that may occur on a landscape scale by increasing pollinator densities. Additionally, while most studies tend to work within a shorter temporal scale, the impacts of the alien plant introductionsmay differ depending on the year or seasonal time leading to the differing results reported.

Despite ongoing concerns and controversy over a putative 'global pollination crisis' there is little information on the response of bees, the most important group of pollinators, to land-use change. In particular, there are no published studies of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire bee communities.2. We examined bee community responses to forest fragment size, shape, isolation and landscape context (forest variables) by sampling foraging bees at ground level using aerial netting within, and in pastures adjacent to, 22 forest fragments ranging in area from c. 0.25 ha to 230 ha, in southern Costa Rica. We sampled each site 13 times in total, in both wet and dry seasons.3. Although there were no effects of forest variables on bee diversity and abundance, we did find strong changes in bee community composition. In particular, tree-nesting meliponines (social stingless bees) were associated with larger fragments, smaller edge:area ratios and greater proportions of forest surrounding sample points, while introduced Apis showed opposite patterns.4. Community composition was also strikingly different between forests and pastures, despite their spatial proximity. In forests, even in the smallest patches, meliponines comprised a much larger proportion of the apifauna, and orchid bees (euglossines) were common. In pastures, Apis was much more abundant and no euglossine bees were found.5. These results agree broadly with other studies that have found contrasting responses to habitat fragmentation from different bee groups. Conserving meliponine bees, important for pollination of coffee and other crops, and euglossine bees, critical in long-distance pollen transport, will require forest.6. Synthesis and applications. In the first study of the effects of tropical forest fragmentation on entire understorey bee assemblages, we found bee community resilience to land-use change, as deforested sites and small forest fragments can have a diverse component of bees. While bees as a whole show some degree of resilience to land-use change, there are taxon-specific responses and, in our study area, there is clear value to conserving native forest, particularly for the ecologically and economically important meliponine and euglossine bees.																		0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000255464600005

We hypothesized that, when the showy invasive species Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) was present, pollinator visitation and seed set would be reduced in a native congener, L. alatum (winged loosestrife). To test this hypothesis, we constructed mixed and monospecific plots of the two species. Over two years of study, we found that L. salicaria significantly reduced both pollinator visitation and seed set in L. alatum. Furthermore, pollinators moved frequently between the two plant species, which may cause heterospecific pollen transfer. Thus, reductions in both pollen quantity and pollen quality may reduce L. alatum seed set. If similar patterns occur in the field, invasive plants may be an even greater threat to natives than previously thought.																		0012-9658			WOS:000177434200026

Parasites can have dramatic effects on the ecology of their hosts. Such strong host-parasite interactions are the result of either parasites with generally high virulence, or generally benign parasites that nevertheless express context-dependent virulence. Theoretically, one indication that an apparently benign parasite nevertheless has a large impact on its host should be the existence of strong genotypic interactions between host and parasite.2. Crithidia bombi (Trypanosomatidae) is a highly prevalent but generally benign gut parasite of the bumble-bee Bombus terrestris. The demonstration of strong genotypic interactions between C. bombi and B. terrestris, however, suggests that context-dependent virulence may have a large impact on the host population. We thus investigated the effects of C. bombi across the entire life cycle of its host, including the stressful times of hibernation and colony-founding. Owing to the high prevalence and rates of transmission of the parasite in field populations, we used a large-scale laboratory experiment.3. Under stressful hibernation, infected queens lost more mass. Infection also significantly reduced colony-founding success, colony size, male production and overall fitness, by up to 40%. These findings show that strong genotypic host-parasite interactions may indeed be a reliable indicator that apparently benign and highly prevalent parasites are nevertheless exerting a dramatic impact on their host populations.																		0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000186432900009

If hours can compensate for parasitism, then parasites may exhibit condition dependent virulence, with high virulence being seen only a hen the host is under conditions of stress. Despite their usually low level of virulence, theory suggests that such parasites may still affect host population dynamics. We tested whether a trypanosome intestinal parasite of bumblebees, Crithidia bombi, expresses condition-dependent virulence. Hosts were infected with the parasite and then kept under either favourable or starvation (stressed) conditions. Under favourable conditions the infection caused no mortality, while when hosts were starved the infection increased the host mortality rate by 50%. In addition, we found a parasite-related change in host resource allocation patterns. Infected bees invested relatively more resources into their fat body and less into their reproductive system than did non-infected bees. Whether this reallocation is parasite-driven, to enhance transmission, or a host-response to parasitism, remains unknown.																		0030-1299			WOS:000166777500002

Intuition suggests that parasites should evolve to be benign whenever the host is needed for transmission: Yet a growing theoretical literature offers several models to explain why natural selection may favor virulent parasites over avirulent ones. This perspective first organizes these models into a simple framework and then evaluates the empirical evidence for and against the models. There is relatively scant evidence to support any of the models rigorously, and indeed, there are only a few unequivocal observations of virulence actually evolving in parasite populations. These shortcomings are surmountable, however, and empirical models of host-parasite interactions have been developed for many kinds of pathogens so that the relevant data could be acquired in the near future. Aside from academic interest, the evolution of virulence has potential medical and agricultural ramifications that may provide evolutionary biology with opportunities for contributions to human welfare. For example, understanding the evolution of parasite virulence may help us design better vaccines, prevent the emergence of highly virulent strains in the future, and diminish the virulence of present pathogens. These potential applications notwithstanding, the usefulness of an evolutionary theory of virulence to social problems has not been demonstrated and is even doubtful in some cases. One promising area for contributions from evolutionary theory is in designing live, attenuated vaccines.																		0014-3820	1558-5646		WOS:A1994QQ65900001	28568406

Horticulturists in Tasmania are hoping to use local, commercially raised colonies for use as pollinators in glasshouses. In this experiment 100 field-captured queens were confined under conditions suitable for colony establishment to check for the prevalence of diploid male production, an indication of inbreeding. The ratio of males to workers at the beginning of colony development was used as an indicator. Results of this experiment show that the Tasmanian bumble bee population is presently very inbred. About 50% of the adult-producing colonies produced initial sex ratios consistent with male diploidy, which suggests that the entire Tasmanian population may be descended from one inseminated queen. The importation of new genetic material may be necessary to sustain commercial breeding of B. terrestris in Tasmania.																		0021-8839			WOS:000074656300004

Many are outstanding "ecological engineers", or providers of "ecosystem services", or potential bioindicator species. Few social insects are currently formally classified as Threatened, but this is almost certainly due to a lack of information on population sizes and trends in scarce species. The main influence that sociality has on threats faced by social insects is in reducing effective population sizes, increasing population genetic subdivision and possibly reducing levels of genetic variation relative to solitary species. The main influence that sociality has on threats from social insects is via its role in the ecological success of invasive species, which frequently pose a major hazard to native biotas. In some cases, social features underpinning ecological success in the original range almost certainly contribute to the success of invasive social insects. However, recent studies show or strongly suggest that, in some of the most notoriously invasive populations of ants, bees and wasps, novel social traits have arisen that greatly enhance the rate of spread and ecological competitiveness of these populations. Sociality can therefore represent either a liability or an asset in its contribution to the persistence of social insect populations.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000172341500018

Commercially-produced bumble bees used in greenhouse pollination often have higher levels of various pathogens than wild bumble bees. These pathogens may spread to wild bees when commercial bees escape from greenhouses and interact with their wild counterparts at nearby flowers. We examined the prevalence of four pathogens in wild bumble bee populations at locations near and distant to commercial greenhouses in southern Ontario, Canada. Bumble bees collected near commercial greenhouses were more frequently infected by those pathogens capable of being transmitted at flowers (Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi) than bees collected at sites away from greenhouses. We argue that the spillover of pathogens from commercial to wild bees is the most likely cause of this pattern and we discuss the implications of such spillover for bumble bee conservation.

Although pollen is a vital nutritional resource for honey bees, Apis mellifera, the influence of pollen quality on their foraging behaviour is little understood.2. In choice-test experiments, bees showed no innate pollen-foraging preferences, but preferred oilseed rape Brassica napus pollen over field bean Vicia faba pollen after previous foraging experience of oilseed rape.3. The free amino acid content of oilseed rape and field bean pollen was compared using high-performance liquid chromatography. Oilseed rape pollen contained a greater proportion of the most essential amino acids required by honey bees ( valine, leucine, and isoleucine) than field bean, suggesting that oilseed rape pollen is of greater nutritional quality for honey bees than is field bean pollen.4. Honey bee foraging preferences appeared to reflect pollen quality. The hypothesis that pollen amino acid composition affects the foraging behaviour of honey bees is discussed.																		0307-6946			WOS:000185445900014

Evaluating plants for pollinator-friendly gardens								ANNALS OF BOTANY				87	2			219	232		10.1006/anbo.2000.1322				FEB 2001	2001	In a series of dawn-to-dusk studies, we examined the nature and accessibility of nectar rewards for pollinating insects by monitoring insect visits and the secretion rate and standing crop of nectar in the British native plant species Salvia pratensis, Stachys palustris, S. officinalis, Lythrum salicaria, Linaria vulgaris, the non-native Calendula officinalis, Petunia x hybrida, Salvia splendens, and the possibly introduced Saponaria officinalis. We also compared single with double variants of Lotus corniculatus, Saponaria officinalis, Petunia x hybrida and Calendula officinalis. All the British species studied are nectar-rich and are recommended for pollinator-friendly gardens. They showed maximal secretion rates of about 10-90 mug sugar per flower h(-1), and most had mean standing crops of about 5-60 mug sugar per flower. In all British species studied, the corolla was deep enough for the relatively long-tongued bumblebee Bombus pascuorum, but the shallower flowers of Lythrum salicaria were also much visited by shorter-tongued bees and hoverflies, as well as by butterflies. The exotic Salvia splendens, presumably coevolved with hummingbirds in the Neotropics, has such deep flowers that British bees cannot reach the nectar except by crawling down the corolla. With a secretion rate approaching 300 mug sugar per flower h(-1) and little depletion by insects; S. splendens accumulated high standing crops of nectar. S. splendens, and single and double flowers of the two probably moth-pollinated species Petunia x hybrida and Saponaria officinalis, received few daytime visits despite abundant nectar but Calendula was well visited by hoverflies and bees. We compared single and double variants of Lotus corniculatus, Petunia x hybrida and Calendula officinalis, and also Saponaria officinalis, the last being probably introduced in Britain (Stace, 1997 New flora of the British Isles. 2nd edn. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). In Petunia, Saponaria and Lotus, double flowers secreted little or no nectar. In Calendula, where doubling involved a change in the proportion of disc and ray florets rather than modification of individual flower structure, double and single capitula had similar standing crops of nectar. Except in Calendula, exotic or double flowers were little exploited by insect visitors. In the exotics, this was probably due to the absence or scarcity of coevolved pollinators, coupled, in double flowers, with the absence of nectar.

A model is described that evaluates the maximum economic foraging range in central place foragers by using optimality criteria to discriminate between foraging sites at different distances from the forager's central place.2. The basic model can be varied to suit foragers that optimise either their rate of net energy uptake or their foraging efficiency.3. The model requires specification of the time and energy budgets of travel and foraging, and of the rewards obtainable at potential foraging sites.4. The specific case of bumblebees, whose foraging ranges are poorly known, is considered.5. Numerical solutions of the model for parameter values that represent bumblebees and their forage predict economic foraging ranges exceeding several kilometres. The model demonstrates that economics alone can explain extensive flight ranges in bees.																		0307-6946	1365-2311		WOS:000089193900001

Strategies for their conservation require knowledge of their foraging range and nesting density, both of which are poorly understood. Previous studies have mainly focussed on the cosmopolitan bumblebee species Bombus terrestris, and implicitly assume this to be representative of other species. Here we use a landscape-scale microsatellite study to estimate the foraging range and nesting density of two ecologically dissimilar species, B. terrestris and R pascuorum. Workers were sampled along a 10 kin linear transect and 8-9 polymorphic microsatellite markers used to identify putative sisters. We provide the first published estimates of the number of colonies using a circle of radius 50 in in an agricultural landscape: 20.4 for R terrestris and 54.7 for R pascuorum. Estimates of nest density differed significantly between the two species: 13 km(-2) for B. terrestris and 193 km(-2) for B. pascuorum. Foraging ranges also differed substantially, with R pascuorum foraging over distances less than 312 in and R terrestris less than 625 m. Clearly bumblebee species differ greatly in fundamental aspects of their ecology. This has significant implications for the development of conservation strategies for rare bumblebees and isolated plant populations, for the management of bumblebees as pollinators, and for predicting patterns of gene flow from genetically modified plants.																		0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000225266600003

Seventy-nine colonies were analysed from thirteen apiaries in six populations that have been kept from recent queen introduction. The length and restriction pattern of the PCR amplified products of the intergenic region identified four mitochondrial haplotypes. One of these haplotypes shows the same restriction pattern and composition of the intergenic region carried by honeybees belonging to the African lineage. Two haplotypes are characterised by a particular intergenic region found with high frequency in the Canarian populations. The haplotype representative of the East European honeybee lineage shows a frequency of 35%, thus indicating introduction of queen honeybees. The finding of this haplotype in Canarian honeybees suggests that hybridisation between the endemic Apis mellifera populations and imported bees is occurring in Tenerife.																		0960-3115	1572-9710		WOS:000173702400004

Yet the distribution of these subspecies is nowadays also much influenced by beekeeping activities. Large scale migratory beekeeping and trade in queens, coupled with the promiscuous mating system of honeybees, have exposed native European honeybees to increasing introgressive hybridization with managed non-native subspecies, which may lead to the loss of valuable combinations of traits shaped by natural selection. Other threats to European honeybees are factors that have caused a progressive decline in A. mellifera throughout the world in recent years, leading to large economic losses and jeopardizing ecosystem functioning. We review the biodiversity of European honeybees and summarize the management and conservation strategies employed by different countries. A comprehensive picture of the beekeeping industry in Europe is also provided. Finally we evaluate the potential threats affecting the biodiversity of European honeybee populations and provide some perspectives for future research.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000267832600005

Here, a case is reported in which floral visitation by the introduced honeybee affects male fitness and probably fruit and seed production of a tropical tree without affecting the resource sought by the native pollinator. Clusia arrudae is a dioecious species and is pollinated by individuals of Eufriesea nigrohirta that visit its flowers to collect resin. Male flowers, however, are also visited by individuals of A. mellifera, which remove ca 99 percent of their pollen grains. When E. nigrobirta leaves flowers previously visited by A. mellifera, they carry on their bodies less than 0.1 percent of the pollen grains carried by bees leaving flowers not visited by the honeybee. This may explain why the frequency of A. mellifera at male flowers is negatively correlated with the number of seeds produced by female flowers. This novel situation may affect other plants offering alternative rewards for pollinators, such as resins, oils, and aromatic compounds.																		0006-3606	1744-7429		WOS:000223742800010		
J	Donovan, B. J.								Interactions between native and introduced bees in New Zealand.								New Zealand Journal of Ecology				3				104	116						1980	1980	There are about 40 species of native bees in New Zealand, 36 of which belong to the Colletidae family, and the rest to the Halictidae. Introduced species include Apis mellifera, 4 Bombus species, and Nomia melanderi and Megachile rotundata. Honeybees in commercial apiaries, and other introduced species, forage mainly on introduced plants, but some honeybees do compete with native bees on native plants. The peak of foraging by native bees occurs at the season of the main honey flow, when there is most food. It is thought that competition for nest sites does not occur. It is concluded that the introduced species do not have a deleterious effect on native species; much more information on the latter is needed. P.

Here we investigate the mechanisms by which this happens. Successful Bombus terrestris foragers perform irregular runs in their nest, often lasting for several minutes. Run duration is at its maximum when food has just been discovered. Running likely serves to distribute a pheromone, since the information flow between "runners" and "recruits" can be disrupted by eliminating air exchange, while leaving other potential means of communication intact. In addition, nectar stores in the nest may be monitored continuously. A sudden influx of nectar into the nest also causes measurable increases in forager activity. The implications of bumblebee recruitment behavior for the evolution of communication in bees are discussed.																		0340-5443	1432-0762		WOS:000172390300011

We selected two study populations, one dominated by honey bees, while the other was visited by many native insects. During peak activity period of insects, nectar was nearly completely depleted in flowers of the first, but not the latter population. Thus, a high abundance of honey bees may have suppressed visitation by native animals due to exploitative competition. Honey bees stayed longer and visited more flowers on the same inflorescence than native bees, thus potentially promoting self-pollination of the plants. Level of seed set and viability was similar in the two study populations. However, we cannot rule out long-term changes in genetic population structure due to changes in gene-flow patterns caused by foraging behaviour of honey bees vs. native flower-visitors.

But aside from providing rewards, flowers can be risky places to visit, for example if a predator ambushes during the feeding/pollination process. Here, we show that pollination may also involve the transmission of pathogens for the pollinators. Experimental evidence is given that a trypanosome parasite, Crithidia bombi, can be horizontally transmitted within populations of its hosts, the bumblebees Bombus spp., through the shared use of flowers. Important floral characteristics such as nectar availability or inflorescence architecture may also affect transmission rate. Therefore, in addition to energetic considerations, pollinator strategies could also be governed by the risk of contracting pathogens.																		0962-8452			WOS:A1994QB14000013

Recent studies on British bumblebees proposed alternative theories to explain declines. One study suggested that greater dietary specialization among the rarer bumblebee species makes them more susceptible to decline. A second study disputed this theory and found that declines in British bumblebees were correlated with the size of species' European ranges, leading to the suggestion that climate and habitat specialization may be better indicators of the risk of decline. Here we use a new and independent dataset based on Irish bumblebees to test the generality of these theories. We found that most of the same bumblebee species are declining across the British Isles, but that, within Ireland, a simple food-plant specialization model is inadequate to explain these declines. Furthermore, we found no evidence of a relationship between declines in Irish bumblebees and the size of species' European ranges. However, we demonstrate that the late emerging species have declined in Ireland (and in Britain), and that these species show a statistically significant westward shift to the extremity of their range, probably as a result of changing land use. Irish data support the finding that rare and declining bumblebees are later nesting species, associated with open grassy habitats. We suggest that the widespread replacement of hay with silage in the agricultural landscape, which results in earlier and more frequent mowing and a reduction in late summer wildflowers, has played a major role in bumblebee declines.

Using specific RT-PCR protocols for the detection of DWV followed by sequencing of the PCR products we could demonstrate that the bumble bees were indeed infected with DWV. Since such deformed bumble bees are not viable DWV infection may pose a serious threat to bumble bee populations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Pollinator activity at D. obtusifolius trees and subsequent seed production were recorded in three forest areas subject to differing intensities of S. siamensis extraction. The pollinator and plant understory communities in these areas were also noted. Forest areas subject to high S. siamensis extraction intensities had very high understory flowering plant cover, dominated by the exotic invader Chromolaena odorata. Activity of butterfly pollinators at D. obtusifolius trees decreased in these disturbed areas, although their abundance remained comparable to other forest areas subject to only moderate or no extraction. For sphingid moth pollinators, there was no difference across differentially disturbed forest areas in either abundance or in the proportion bearing pollen. Pollinator activity by birds increased at highly disturbed locations but was not sufficient to offset a decline in overall pollinator activity at D. obtusifolius canopies in areas of heavy S. siamensis extraction. Thus, extraction of S. siamensis indirectly affected the pollination of D. obtusifolius, primarily by causing changes in the foraging behavior of butterfly pollinators rather than their abundance. A shift in the relative abundance of floral nectar resources from the canopy to the understory a consequence of S. siamensis extraction and invasion by C odorata, led to a parallel shift in foraging location of the principal diurnal pollinators, the butterflies, toward the understory. Despite reduced pollination at disturbed sites, behavioral changes did not translate into a D. obtusifolius seed set effect, possibly because pollination by birds (or moths) at the disturbed site compensated for reduced butterfly pollination.																		0006-3606	1744-7429		WOS:000222092900005

This has led to demands for a response by land managers, conservationists and political decision makers to the impending 'global pollinator crisis'. In questioning this crisis, it becomes apparent that perceptions of a pollinator crisis are driven mainly by reported declines of crop-pollinating honeybees in North America, and bumblebees and butterflies in Europe, whereas native pollinator communities elsewhere show mixed responses to environmental change. Additionally, few staple food crops depend on pollinator services, and most crops that do are grown at small scales in diversified agro-ecosystems that are likely to support healthy pollinator communities, or in highly managed systems that are largely independent of wild pollinators. Consequently, justifying conservation action on the basis of deteriorating pollinator services might be misplaced. Nevertheless, existing initiatives to monitor pollinators are well founded, given the uncertainty about the dynamics of pollinator populations.																		0169-5347			WOS:000230504500007	16701398

We also investigated mite infestation in commercial colonies of a Japanese native species, B. ignitus, which are mass-produced in the Netherlands and reimported into Japan. We detected the mite in both natural and commercial colonies of the Japanese species. Comparison of 555 bp sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I (CO1) gene from the mite showed that there were seven haplotypes, on the basis of combinations of substitutions at eight sites in the gene. The haplotypes of the mites in the Japanese native bumblebees and the haplotypes of the mites in B. terrestris did not overlap; however, mtDNA of mites detected in the commercial colonies of B. ignitus possessed the same sequence as a European haplotype. These results indicate that transportation of bumblebee colonies will cause overseas migration of parasitic mites of different origins.																		0962-1083			WOS:000170667500023	11555253

We also investigated mite infestation in commercial colonies of the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, imported from the Netherlands and Belgium, and the Japanese native species, B. ignitus, imported from the Netherlands, between 1997 and 2001. We detected mites in natural populations of the two B. hypocrita subspecies and in the commercial colonies. Analysis of variations in 535 bp sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene showed that the mite haplotypes in the native populations and in the imported colonies did not overlap in 1997-1999, but in 2000-2001 some mites possessing European CO1 haplotypes were detected in the natural populations of Japanese native bumblebees. In addition, many mites possessing Japanese haplotypes were detected in the imported commercial colonies from Europe. Considering the fact that the Japanese native bumblebees, B. hypocrita, were once exported to Europe for commercialization, these results suggest that bumblebee commercialization has caused overseas migration and cross-infestation of parasitic mites among natural and commercial colonies. However, because the Japanese and European CO1 haplotypes were closely related, there was a possibility that the European haplotypes found in the mites in the Hokkaido Island revealed native variation. To clarify the status of mite invasion, further detailed analysis of genetic variation of the mite, using other genetic markers on additional samples, need to be performed.					22nd Symposium of the Society-of-Population-Ecology22nd Symposium of the Society-of-Population-Ecology	OCT 28-30, 2005OCT 28-30, 2005	Soc Populat EcolSoc Populat Ecol	Ishikawa, JAPANIshikawa, JAPAN										1438-3896			WOS:000241451500005

As a result several bee species have been introduced to countries far beyond their home range, including A. mellifera, bumblebees (Bombus sp.), the alfalfa leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata, and various other solitary species. Possible negative consequences of these introductions include: competition with native pollinators for floral resources; competition for nest sites; co-introduction of natural enemies, particularly pathogens that may infect native organisms; pollination of exotic weeds; and disruption of pollination of native plants. For most exotic bee species little or nothing is known of these possible effects. Research to date has focused mainly on A. mellifera, and has largely been concerned with detecting competition with native flower visitors. Considerable circumstantial evidence has accrued that competition does occur, but no experiment has clearly demonstrated long-term reductions in populations of native organisms. Most researchers agree that this probably reflects the difficulty of carrying out convincing studies of competition between such mobile organisms, rather than a genuine absence of competitive effects. Effects on seed set of exotic weeds are easier to demonstrate. Exotic bees often exhibit marked preferences for visiting flowers of exotic plants. For example, in Australia and New Zealand many weeds from Europe are now visited by European honeybees and bumblebees. Introduced bees are primary pollinators of a number of serious weeds. Negative impacts of exotic bees need to be carefully assessed before further introductions are carried out.																		1543-592X	1545-2069		WOS:000220102000001

Impacts of habitat degradation and fragmentation are likely to be compounded by the social nature of humble bees and their largely monogamous breeding system, which renders their effective population size low. Hence, populations are susceptible to stochastic extinction events and inbreeding. In North America, catastrophic declines of some bumble bee species since the 1990s are probably attributable to the accidental introduction of a normative parasite from Europe, a result of global trade in domesticated bumble bee colonies used for pollination of greenhouse crops. Given the importance of bumble bees as pollinators of crops and wildflowers, steps must be taken to prevent further declines. Suggested measures include fight regulation of commercial bumble bee use and targeted use of environmentally comparable schemes to enhance floristic diversity in agricultural landscapes.																		0066-4170	1545-4487		WOS:000252684300012	17803456

Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers were marked with numbered tags and displaced up to 15 km from their nest. Bees returned from distances of up to 9.8 km, with the proportion of bees returning declining with distance of the release site from the nest. Bees were slow to return to their nests, often taking several days when even the most distant sites were all within 1 h direct flight time. These findings concur with those of earlier studies on various Hymenoptera, and they are consistent with previous suggestions that the most probable homing mechanism is a systematic search until familiar landmarks are encountered. Our results also suggest that the natural foraging range of B. terrestris may span several km.																		0044-8435			WOS:000166737700009

JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION				6	3			179	189		10.1023/A:1023239221447				SEP 2002	2002	Honeybees, Apis mellifera, have been introduced by man throughout the globe. More recently, other bee species including various bumblebees (Bombus spp.) have been introduced to several new regions. Here we examine the impacts of honeybees and the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, on native flower-visiting insects in Tasmania. To assess whether native insects have lower abundance or are excluded in areas that have been colonised by exotic bees, we quantified the abundance, diversity and floral preferences of flower-visiting insects at sites where bumblebees and honeybees were present, and compared them to sites where they were absent. This was achieved by hand searches at 67 sites, and by deploying sticky traps at 122 sites. Honeybees were by far the most abundant bee species overall, and dominated the bee fauna at most sites. There was considerable niche overlap between honeybees, bumblebees and native bees in terms of the flowers that they visited. Sites where bumblebees were established had similar species richness, diversity and abundance of native flower-visiting insects compared to sites where bumblebees were absent. In contrast, native bees were more than three times more abundant at the few sites where honeybees were absent, compared to those where they were present. Our results are suggestive of competition between honeybees and native bees, but exclusion experiments are needed to provide a definitive test.																		1366-638X	1572-9753		WOS:000208370600005

Pollinator visits, heterospecific and conspecific stigmatic pollen loads, fruit and seed set were measured and compared among experimental plots of low, medium, and high densities of Lythrum salicaria. Honey bees accounted for over 90% of the visits to Lythrum salicaria. In medium-density plots, in one of the two study sites. there was 19% reduction in seed production in Eupatorium perfoliatum and more than 58% increase in the amount of Lythrum salicaria pollen on Eupatorium maculatum stigmas. In high-density plots at one site, 30% fewer fruit set in Impatiens capensis. These data indicate that Lythrum salicaria can have a negative impact on wetland plant communities.																		1195-6860			WOS:000084000900012

The species obligatorily relies on pollinators to effect fruit-set and in this study the effect of fragmentation and the presence of the introduced honeybee on fruit-set was examined at two locations. Over two seasons Dillwynia juniperina was not pollen-limited indicating that flowers were saturated with pollen and that adequate bee servicing was occurring. Two native bee species (Leioproctus sp. 1 and Lasioglossum sp.) and the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera L., were the. most common visitors to flowers. Bee abundance varied between sites with honeybees being more common than native bees at one site. Native bees were never the most dominant pollinator. Visitation data show that native bees spend more time at flowers than introduced bees, although on average honeybees visit slightly more flowers on a bush than do native bees. Visitation data also revealed that native bee presence at bushes is negatively correlated with the presence of honeybees at the same bushes. At one of the study sites, honeybees were very abundant, but very few native bees were ever recorded over the 3 years. Results show that flowers can be pollinated from a single visit by a honeybee or native bee. Extrapolation of visitation data showed that native bees could on their own adequately service flowers in some years at some sites while at other times introduced honeybees may be necessary to augment pollination services.

The effects, if any, of honeybee-foraging on native plants and their native-bee pollinators is poorly understood as most studies to date have concentrated on bird-pollinated systems. Furthermore, such studies have been undertaken in temperate Australia where feral and managed hives have been present for more than 150 years. In tropical Australia the impact of honeybees on the native biota is not known-yet the information is needed to assist with planning for the management of the large areas now under control of conservation authorities. We undertook a comparative study of honeybee and native bee pollination of the pioneer species Melastoma affine in tropical north Queensland, Australia, at a site where honeybees were recently introduced as managed hives. Melastoma affine is utilised by many animals in this ecosystem and its pollination mechanism is representative of several other pioneer species of the rainforest margin. Melastoma affine obligately relies on bee pollination to effect seed-set. Native bees were the most abundant floral visitors to M. affine although significantly more honeybees than native bees were sometimes present at flowers at the end of the morning. Honeybees were poor pollinators of M. affine compared with native bees. Honeybees deposited significantly less pollen on stigmas than native bees and honeybees actively removed pollen from stigmas. Consequently, fruit-set was less likely and seed-set was significantly lower in flowers to which honeybees were the last visitor, compared with cases where native bees were the last visitor-and the last visitor to M. affine flowers was most often A. mellifera. In 91% of interactions between honeybees and native bees, native bees were disturbed from foraging at flowers by honeybees. Honeybees reduced fitness in M. affine in this study and we thus conclude that honeybees are an undesirable introduction in montane tropical-rainforest systems in Australia and based on our findings we strongly recommend that honeybees not be agisted in or adjacent to conservation areas in the wet tropics of Australia.

Here, we combined detailed field observations, molecular approaches and GIS-based quantification of landscape structure (measured by proportions of seminatural habitats and proportions of mass flowering crops) to get new insights into driving forces of population dynamics of the bumblebee species Bombus pascuorum. Comparing 13 agriculturally dominated landscape sectors, we found the proportion of mass flowering crops to positively influence bumblebee abundance whereas the proportion of seminatural habitats was of minor importance. We used microsatellites to quantify landscape-related colony densities, inbreeding and population substructure. Detected colony densities did not correlate with landscape parameters or with local worker abundance, measured by field observations. These results indicate that increased worker abundances within landscapes are rather due to greater colony sizes than due to an increased number of nests. We found significant population substructure, measured by F-ST and seven landscape sectors to bear significantly increased inbreeding values (F-IS). F-IS was strongly varying between sectors but did not correlate with landscape structure. Moreover, F-IS had a significantly negative effect on colony size, demonstrating the importance of genetic diversity on population fitness at a landscape scale. We suggest that inbreeding levels might be related to the temporal variation of food resources and population sizes in agricultural landscapes.																		0962-1083			WOS:000244602500005	17391404

This study related differences in three functional traits of pollinating bees ( flower height preference, daily time of flower visitation and within-flower behaviour) to the seed set of the obligate cross-pollinated pumpkin Cucurbita moschata Duch. ex Poir. across a land-use intensity gradient from tropical rainforest and agroforests to grassland in Indonesia. Bee richness and abundance changed with habitat variables and we used this natural variation to test whether complementary resource use by the diverse pollinator community enhanced final yield. We found that pollinator diversity, but not abundance, was positively related to seed set of pumpkins. Bees showed species-specific spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation traits and within-flower behaviour, allowing for classification into functional guilds. Diversity of functional groups explained even more of the variance in seed set (r(2)=45%) than did species richness (r(2)=32%) highlighting the role of functional complementarity. Even though we do not provide experimental, but rather correlative evidence, we can link spatial and temporal complementarity in highly diverse pollinator communities to pollination success in the field, leading to enhanced crop yield without any managed honeybees.																		0962-8452			WOS:000258440500014	18595841

We investigated small hive beetle host choice, bumblebee colony defence as well as individual defensive behaviour of honeybee and bumblebee workers. Our findings show that in its new range in North America, bumblebees are potential alternate hosts for the small hive beetle. We found that small hive beetles do invade bumblebee colonies and readily oviposit there. Honeybee colonies are not preferred over bumblebee colonies. But even though bumblebees lack a co-evolutionary history with the small hive beetle, they are able to defend their colonies against this nest intruder by removal of beetle eggs and larvae and stinging of the latter. Hence, the observed behavioural mechanisms must be part of a generalistic defence system suitable for defence against multiple attackers. Nevertheless, there are quantitative (worker force) and qualitative differences (hygienic behaviour) between A. mellifera and B. impatiens.																		0020-1812			WOS:000256317500008

Agri-environment schemes promote organic farming in an attempt to reduce the negative effects of agricultural intensification on farmland biodiversity and ecosystem services such as pollination. Farming system, landscape context and regional differences may all influence biodiversity, but their relative impact and possible interactions have been little explored.2. The study was performed in three regions (150 km apart, 400-500 km(2) per region) differing in land use intensity. Within each region, seven pairs of conventionally and organically cultivated wheat fields (mean size 4 ha, 42 study fields) were selected to encompass a gradient from heterogeneous to homogeneous landscapes within a 1-km radius around each field.3. Farming system had the greatest influence on biodiversity. Higher bee diversity, flower cover and diversity of flowering plants were recorded in organic compared with conventional fields. Bee diversity was related both to flower cover and diversity of flowering plants, suggesting plant-mediated effects of the farming system.4. Differences in bee diversity between organic and conventional fields increased with the proportion of arable crops in the surrounding landscape, indicating that processes at the landscape level modified the effectiveness of organic farming in promoting biodiversity. Similar patterns for flower cover and diversity of flowering plants suggested that landscape effects on bee diversity were mainly resource-mediated. After statistically removing the variance explained by flower parameters, residual bee diversity increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity.5. Bee diversity differed between the three regions, but the effects of farming systems and landscape context were independent of regional differences.6. Synthesis and applications. Bee diversity in wheat fields was mainly influenced by farming system, but an understanding of local bee diversity needs to incorporate both landscape and regional perspectives. The consistency of the results in three regions provides a reliable basis for management decisions. Agri-environment schemes that promote organic farming in homogeneous landscapes where there are few remaining flower-rich habitats could have the highest relative impact. However, while organic farming could help to sustain pollination services by generalist bees in agricultural landscapes, other measures are required to conserve more specialized bee species in semi-natural habitats.																		0021-8901			WOS:000243023600006		
J	Horskins, K; Turner, VB								Resource use and foraging patterns of honeybees, Apis mellifera, and native insects on flowers of Eucalyptus costata								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				24	3			221	227		10.1046/j.1442-9993.1999.00965.x				JUN 1999	1999	Introduced honeybees have become well established throughout Australia and concerns have been raised about their impact on the native flora and fauna. Such concerns include the possible depletion of nectar resources by honeybees to the detriment of native animals and the ability of honeybees to pollinate Australian plants. The foraging patterns and resource utilization of honeybees (Apis mellifera) and native insects on flowers of yellow Mallee (Eucalyptus costata) (Behr & F. Muell, ex E Muell.) were studied in Wyperfeld National Park during spring 1994. Seventy-four insect species visited the flowers with the most prevalent being honeybees, native bees (Lasioglossum and Hylaeus) and ants (Iridiomyrmex). Honeybees began foraging at lower temperatures than native bees and hence had initial access to the nectar supply that was primarily produced overnight by E. costata. However, the majority (90%) of early morning visits to flowers by honeybees involved the collection of pollen. Honeybees did not forage for nectar in substantial numbers until after native insects were active. Despite both consumption and evaporation, nectar supplies remained available at midday and at one site remained available for consumption at dusk. Honeybees regularly made contact with the receptive stigmata while foraging for pollen and hence had pollen loads consisting of numerous E. costata grains present on their body. These activities are indicative of the behaviour required by insects to facilitate pollination. Given the unique morphology of many native flowers and the contrasting findings from studies to date, it is critical that generalisations about the effect of honeybees in the Australian environment are not made from studies on a limited number of native plant species.																		0307-692X			WOS:000080977800004

We obtained a spore isolate from worker ventriculi of A. mellifera colonies kept on the campus of National Taiwan University and sequenced the ribosomal genes. The entire length of the ribosomal DNA is about 3828 bp and the organization is similar to that of Nosema apis. However, the SSUrRNA, ITS, and LSUrRNA sequences have comparatively low identities with those of N. apis (92, 52, and 89%, respectively) and the SSUrRNA has a 99% identity with Nosema ceranae. These results indicate that this isolate is not N. apis, but N. ceranae. Moreover, the morphological characteristics are identical to those of N. ceranae. These results show that nosema disease of the honeybee, A. mellifera, may not be caused solely by the infection of N. apis.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000244209600004		
J	Huryn, VMB; Moller, H								An assessment of the contribution of honey bees (Apis mellifera) to weed reproduction in New Zealand protected natural areas								NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				19	2			111	122						1995	1995	Recent concern that honey bees may threaten natural areas by increasing weed abundances through increased pollination was investigated by reviewing the literature to determine which weed taxa surveyed from New Zealand Protected Natural Areas (PNAs) are visited by honey bees. The contribution made by honey bees to weed reproduction was assessed by checking reproductive strategies and pollination mechanisms of a subset of problem weeds. A substantial proportion of surveyed weeds in PNAs are probably visited by honey bees (43%) including half of the problem weeds. However, reproduction of the majority of problem weeds is characterised by plastic reproductive mechanisms and/or simple pollination mechanisms where honey bee influence is low or unimportant. Although honey bees may be important pollinators of some weeds, they probably do not contribute substantially to weed problems.																		0110-6465			WOS:A1995TP36900003		
J	Huryn, VMB								Ecological impacts of introduced honey bees								QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY				72	3			275	297		10.1086/419860				SEP 1997	1997	Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), native to Eurasia and Africa, have been introduced to most of the rest of the world. Many plant species are used by introduced honey bees, which suggests a high potential for disturbance of native plant/pollinator relationships. Few species are used intensively, however, thus decreasing the opportunity for disturbance. Pollination studies show that honey bees are effective pollinators of some native plants and less effective pollinators of others; they also reduce floral resources in some species with little or no pollination. Data are insufficient to show whether honey bee foraging on native plants significantly alters pollen and gene flow, but unusual foraging behavior by honey bees is not evident compared to many other pollinators. Honey bees do not physically damage plants; they are also unlikely to increase hybridization of native flora. Pollination by honey bees probably contributes little to the success of most weeds.Experiments have not shown competition for nesting sites between honey bees and native fauna. The presence of honey bees, however, alters the foraging behavior and abundance of some native fauna on flowers, but not studies have shown detrimental impacts of honey bees on population abundance of any native animals or plants. Anecdotal and quantitative reports of increased honey bee abundances on flowers compared with native fauna are often confounded with habitat changes induced by men.																		0033-5770	1539-7718		WOS:A1997XT77700002

Since then wild colonies have developed and spread in some regions. In the present study, we measured the spatial distribution and temporal change in abundance of B. terrestris in the Chitose River Basin, Hokkaido, Japan to elucidate the relation of greenhouses to the bee's distribution and to evaluate its potential effects on native bumblebees. Bumblebees were collected with window traps in windbreak forests roughly 1, 2, 4, and 6 km NNW and SSE of a large greenhouse. The peak catch of B. terrestris queens occurred in early June, suggesting that they had successfully hibernated in the field. The distributions of B. terrestris and the native B. ardens were mutually exclusive, while the native B. hypocrita appeared at all sites. Catches of B. terrestris were restricted to within 4 km of the nearest greenhouse, suggesting that the invasion was still in the initial phase in this area. The reduction in abundance of the native bumblebees in the sites of high B. terrestris abundance suggests the presence of interspecies competition between B. terrestris and the native bumblebees during the early part of the colony activity, although such reduction in B. ardens can be explained by habitat suitability.																		1438-3896			WOS:000229109900010

Although invasive species are major topics of research, little consideration has been given to the implications of introducing non-native subspecies or beneficial organisms such as pollinators. However, the extensive trade in bumble bees as pollinators of glasshouse crops involves both. Within regions in Europe, the importation of non-native commercially reared subspecies of Bombus terrestris could endanger native bumble bees through competitive displacement and/or hybridization.2. This study made a direct ecological comparison between commercially imported and native B. terrestris colonies growing in the wild in the UK. In particular, using a paired design, we compared the nectar-foraging performance and reproductive outputs of commercial and native colonies growing under identical field conditions.3. Commercial colonies performed well in the field, with substantially higher nectar-foraging rates than native colonies in four out of five locations. Nectar-foraging performance was positively correlated with forager size, with commercial bees being consistently larger than native bees.4. All seven commercial colonies studied produced gynes (new queens), with two colonies each producing in excess of 50. In contrast, only two out of seven native colonies produced gynes, and those only produced small numbers (five in total). Males were produced by all colonies but there were no significant differences in numbers between commercial and native subspecies.5. Synthesis and applications. The high reproductive success of commercial colonies indicates that there is an appreciable risk that they will become established and spread within the UK. Furthermore, their superior foraging ability and large colony size could lead them to out-compete native bumble bees. Clearly the invasive potential of non-native subspecies and/or beneficial organisms should not be overlooked. With respect to the current importation of commercial bumble bees, we strongly recommend a precautionary approach: native species and subspecies should be locally reared and the use/disposal of bees should be strictly regulated.																		0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000239987700011

Although previous studies have shown that these subspecies will interbreed, none have assessed mating preference of the different populations. This study examines the mating preferences between two geographically isolated populations of B terrestris which have unnaturally been brought together through the commercial trade in bumblebees. Under controlled choice conditions, mating between commercially imported B t dalmatinus (from South Eastern Europe) and native British B t audax was non-random. Commercially imported gynes (unfertilised queens) preferred to mate with males from the same population (71% of matings). In light of the continued escape of imported gynes and males, these results indicate that there is a possibility of establishment of South Eastern European B t dalmatinus in Britain, and that hybrids will also occur. The ecological risks of such an establishment are discussed.																		0171-8177			WOS:000235561200008

A population comparison of foraging performance in Bombus terrestris								OECOLOGIA				144	3			508	516		10.1007/s00442-005-0081-9				JUL 2005	2005	Worldwide trade in non-native bumblebees remains largely unrestricted despite well-documented cases where introductions of non-native bees have gone dramatically wrong. Within Europe, indiscriminate importation of non-native populations of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) for the pollination of glasshouse crops continues on a massive scale. However, no risk assessment has been conducted for these introductions, perhaps because B. terrestris is considered a native species, so shipping populations from one region to another has been implicitly assumed to present no risk. This view is clearly unjustified because Bombus terrestris populations differ significantly in their genetic makeup as demonstrated by strong differences in coat colour and behavioural traits. Therefore, for the first time we compare an important competitive trait, namely foraging performance, between commercially available B. terrestris populations in contrasting environments. We test whether commercially reared populations differ in their nectar foraging performance and whether this is influenced by both their source environment and the one they are introduced into. We do this by means of a reciprocal transplant experiment. Strong, consistent interpopulation differences in performance occurred irrespective of test location: Canary Island bees (B.t. canariensis) were superior to Sardinian bees (B.t. sassaricus), which were generally superior to mainland European bees (B.t. terrestris). These inter-population differences in performance were largely explained by inter-population variation in forager size, with larger bees being superior foragers. However, even when body size was accounted for, "native" bees were not superior to transplanted non-native bees in all but one case. We conclude that non-native populations, especially those with large foragers, can be highly competitive foragers. This could lead to their establishment and displacement of native bees. Therefore, we recommend that unregulated movements of non-native B. terrestris populations within Europe should not be carried out without a full risk assessment.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000231247800019	15891827	
J	Jakobsson, Anna; Padron, Benigno; Traveset, Anna				Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011				Pollen transfer from invasive Carpobrotus spp. to natives - A study of pollinator behaviour and reproduction success								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				141	1			136	145		10.1016/j.biocon.2007.09.005				JAN 2008	2008	The influence of invasive plant species on native community composition is well-documented, but less is known about underlying mechanisms. Especially scarce is knowledge about effects on biotic interactions such as relationships between native plants and their pollinators. In this study we investigate if pollen transfer from the invasive and highly pollen productive Carpobrotus spp. affects seed production and/or seed quality in three native species. We monitored pollinator movements and pollen loads on pollinators and native stigmas, and in a field pollination experiment we investigated the effect of invasive pollen on reproduction. Invasive pollen adhered to pollinators, pollinators switched from Carpobrotus spp. to natives, invasive pollen was transferred to native stigmas, and it affected seed production in one species. Although all possible steps for interference with seed production were found to be qualitatively taken, invasive pollen has probably little impact on the native community because the frequency of invasive pollen transfer to natives was low. However, pollination interactions may change with plant abundance and our study provides evidence that pollen transfer from Carpobrotus spp. to natives does occur and have the potential to affect seed production. We found the species identity of shared pollinators to be of importance, higher flower constancy and lower capacity of pollen adherence are likely to result in less invasive pollen transfer.

Non-native subspecies of honeybees have been introduced and propagated, so that native black honeybee (Apis mellifera mellifera) populations lost their identity by gene-flow or went extinct. After previous studies investigated the remaining gene-pools of native honeybees in France and Spain, we here assess the genetic composition of eight northwest European populations of the black honeybee, using both mitochondrial (restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the intergenic transfer RNAleu-COII region) and nuclear (11 microsatellite loci) markers. Both data sets show that A. m. mellifera populations still exist in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, England, Scotland and Ireland, but that they are threatened by gene flow from commercial honeybees. Both Bayesian admixture analysis of the microsatellite data and DraI-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis of the intergenic region indicated that gene-flow had hardly occurred in some populations, whereas almost 10% introgression was observed in other populations. The most introgressed population was found on the Danish Island of Laeso, which is the last remaining native Danish population of A. m. mellifera and the only one of the eight investigated populations that is protected by law. We discuss how individual admixture analysis can be used to monitor the restoration of honeybee populations that suffer from unwanted hybridization with non-native subspecies.																		0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000226421000009	15643954

Insect pollination is an example of a mutualism that is required for seed-set in the invasive species, Rosa multiflora Thunb. (Rosaceae), an obligate outcrosser. To determine the insect pollinators visiting R. multiflora flowers in Iowa, USA, we collected insects on yellow sticky traps placed on plants during the period of blooming and visually observed insects visiting the flowers. The common insect orders that were collected on the sticky traps included Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Mecoptera, and Thysanoptera. Many of the insects found on the sticky cards were known to feed on pollen. However, we did not collect Apidae (bumble bees and honey bees) on the sticky cards. We observed Bombus spp. and Apis mellifera foraging on the flowers. Syrphid flies were the most commonly observed taxa visiting the flowers. Our results indicate that R. multiflora is utilizing common generalist insect pollinators in Iowa and that pollination is not a limiting factor for this invasive species.																		1444-6162	1445-6664		WOS:000241407000008

Recently, nearly 30% of queens of the Japanese native species Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis and B. hypocrita hypocrita were estimated to copulate with B. terrestris males in the field, suggesting that indigenous bumblebees could be genetically deteriorated through hybrid production with the introduced species. In this study, we evaluated hybrid production between the introduced B. terrestris and the indigenous B. hypocrita sapporoensis under laboratory conditions. The hatching rate of eggs derived from interspecific matings was 0% and 8.6% depending on the direction of the cross, which was significantly lower than that from intraspecific matings of B. terrestris (76.9%) and B. hypocrita sapporoensis (78.9%). Genetic studies using microsatellite markers revealed that both haploid and diploid individuals were present in the egg stage, whereas all hatched larvae were haploid. In addition, histological studies revealed that eggs derived from interspecific matings terminated development 2 days after oviposition. These results strongly suggested that eggs derived from interspecific matings are inviable due to post-mating isolation mechanisms. Mass release of exotic pollinators could cause serious population declines of native bumblebee species.																		0028-1042			WOS:000259737600016	18594790	
J	Kato, M; Shibata, A; Yasui, T; Nagamasu, H								Impact of introduced honeybees, Apis mellifera, upon native bee communities in the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands								RESEARCHES ON POPULATION ECOLOGY				41	2			217	228						1999	1999	The Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands are oceanic islands located in the northwest Pacific, and have ten native (nine endemic) bee species, all of which are nonsocial. The European honeybee (Apis mellifera), which was introduced to the islands for apiculture in the 1880s, became naturalized in a few islands shortly after introduction. To detect the impact of the honeybees upon native bee diversity, we analyzed pollen harvest by honeybees and surveyed the relative abundance of honeybees and native bees on flowers on several islands. Both hived and feral honeybee colonies were active throughout the year, harvesting pollen of both native and alien flowers and from both entomophilous and anemophilous flowers. Honeybees strongly depended on the alien plants, especially during winter to spring when native melittophilous flowers were rare. From June to November, honeybees exhaustively utilized native flowers, which had originally been utilized and pollinated by native bees. On Chichi and Haha Islands, where human disturbance of forests has been severe, both native and alien flowers were dominated by honeybees, and native bees were rare or extinct even in well-conserved forests. In contrast, on Ani Island and Haha's satellite islands where primary forests were well conserved and honeybees were still uncommon or absent, native bees remained dominant. These results suggest that competition for nectar and pollen of the native flowers between honeybees and native bees favors honeybees on the disturbed islands, which are thoroughly invaded by alien nectariferous, sometimes aggressive, weedy plants.																		0034-5466			WOS:000083085600012

However, the need for active conservation of pollination interactions is only now being appreciated. Pollination systems are under increasing threat from anthropogenic sources, including fragmentation of habitat, changes in land use, modern agricultural practices, use of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, and invasions of non-native plants and animals. Honeybees, which themselves are non-native pollinators on most continents, and which may harm native bees and other pollinators, are nonetheless critically important for crop pollination. Recent declines in honeybee numbers in the United States and Europe bring home the importance of healthy pollination systems, and the need to further develop native bees and other animals as crop pollinators. The "pollination crisis" that is evident in declines of honeybees and native bees, and in damage to webs of plant-pollinator interaction, may be ameliorated not only by cultivation of a diversity of crop pollinators, but also by changes in habitat use and agricultural practices, species reintroductions and removals, and other means. In addition, ecologists must redouble efforts to study basic aspects of plant-pollinator interactions if optimal management decisions are to be made for conservation of these interactions in natural acid agricultural ecosystems.																		0066-4162			WOS:000077648200004

The majority of these studies were published in the last 8 years and nearly two-thirds were carried out in North America. These publications concerned 72 invasive insect species, of which two ant species, Solenopsis invicta and Linepithema humile, accounted for 18% and 14% of the studies, respectively. Most publications investigated effects on native biodiversity at population or community level. Genetic effects and, to a lesser extent, effects on ecosystem services and processes were rarely explored. We review the effects caused by different insect invaders according to: their ecosystem roles, i.e. herbivores, predators, parasites, parasitoids and pollinators; the level of biological organisation at which they occur; and the direct and indirect mechanisms underlying these effects. The best documented effects occur in invasive ants, Eurasian forest herbivores invasive in North America, and honeybees. Impacts may occur through simple trophic interactions such as herbivory, predation or parasitism. Alien species may also affect native species and communities through more complex mechanisms such as competition for resources, disease transmission, apparent competition, or pollination disruption, among others. Finally, some invasive insects, particularly forest herbivores and ants, are known to affect ecosystem processes through cascading effects. We identify biases and gaps in our knowledge of ecological effects of invasive insects and suggest further opportunities for research.																		1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000261329100003

Evaluation of the ecological risk of alien pollinators is necessary because they could have a large impact on native ecosystems through disturbing native plant-pollinator interactions. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine the impact of the non-native commercialized European bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, on the pollination success of seven Japanese bumblebee-pollinated plant species. Plants were exposed to three groups of bumblebees: native bumblebee(s) only (NATIVE treatment); the alien bee only (ALIEN) and a mix of the two (MIX). ALIEN treatment had negative effects on fruitset and/or fruit quality of five plants, including self-incompatible and compatible, herb and woody, and queen- and worker-pollinated species. The negative effects were caused by a decrease in legitimate flower visitation due to (1) physical inaccessibility to nectary in deep-corolla flowers by the alien bee with insufficient tongue length and, (2) biased flower preference between short-corolla flowers. Fruitset tended to decrease drastically for the self-incompatible species while fruit quality decreased moderately for the self-compatible species. Effects of MIX were not intermediate between NATIVE and ALIEN in most plant species, and caused pollination success to vary in an unpredictable manner amongst plant species, probably due to interaction between native and alien bees. This non-linear relationship between plants' pollination success and the relative density of the alien suggests that the alien bee can disturb pollination of a plant species even when only representing a small fraction of the total pollinator community.

In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5% are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, wind-pollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000243354100001	17164193

Knowledge of their ecology is vital for the design of effective management and conservation strategies but key aspects remain poorly understood. Here we employed microsatellite markers to estimate and compare foraging range and nest density among four UK species: Bombus terrestris, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus lapidarius, and Bombus pratorum. Workers were sampled along a 1.5-km linear transect across arable farmland. Eight or nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were then used to identify putative sisters. In accordance with previous studies, minimum estimated maximum foraging range was greatest for B. terrestris (758 m) and least for B. pascuorum (449 m). The estimate for B. lapidarius was similar to B. pascuorum (450 m), while that of B. pratorum was intermediate (674 m). Since the area of forage available to bees increases as the square of foraging range, these differences correspond to a threefold variation in the area used by bumblebee nests of different species. Possible explanations for these differences are discussed. Estimates for nest density at the times of sampling were 29, 68, 117, and 26/km(2) for B. terrestris, B. pascuorum, B. lapidarius and B. pratorum, respectively. These data suggest that even among the most common British bumblebee species, significant differences in fundamental aspects of their ecology exist, a finding that should be reflected in management and conservation strategies.																		0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000228395900017	15836652

The best-known of these intoxications involves the eating of 'mad honey (deli bal in Turkish)' contaminated by Rhododendron nectar grayanotoxins. Accounts of mad honey intoxication date back to 401 BC. It is still one of the common food intoxications encountered for humans and livestock in Turkey. Mad honey intoxication's symptoms are dose-related. In mild form, dizziness, weakness, excessive perspiration, hypersalivation, nausea, vomiting and paresthesias are present and close follow-up is enough. However, severe intoxication may lead to life threatening cardiac complications such as complete atrioventricular block that can be treated intravenously. In this review, properties and sources of grayanotoxins, their detection methods and mad honey intoxication are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kremen, C; Williams, NM; Thorp, RW								Crop pollination from native bees at risk from agricultural intensification								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				99	26			16812	16816		10.1073/pnas.262413599				DEC 24 2002	2002	Ecosystem services are critical to human survival; in selected cases, maintaining these services provides a powerful argument for conserving biodiversity. Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however, because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown. Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon, Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for sustaining the service, because of year-to-year variation in community composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will destroy this "free" service, but conservation and restoration of bee habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees.																		0027-8424			WOS:000180101600056	12486221	
J	Lach, Lori				Lach, Lori/B-3145-2011	Lach, Lori/0000-0001-5137-5185			Argentine ants displace floral arthropods in a biodiversity hotspot								DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS				14	2			281	290		10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00410.x				MAR 2008	2008	Argentine ant (Linepithema humile (Mayr)) invasions are often associated with the displacement of ground-dwelling arthropods. Argentine ant invasions can also exert other effects on the community through interactions with plants and their associated arthropods. For example, carbohydrate resources (e.g. floral or extrafloral nectar) may influence foraging behaviour and interactions among ants and other arthropods. In South Africa's Cape Floristic Region, Argentine ants and some native ant species are attracted to the floral nectar of Leucospermum conocarpodendron Rourke (Proteaceae), a native tree that also has extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). Despite having relatively low abundance in pitfall traps, Argentine ants visited inflorescences more frequently and in higher abundance than the most frequently observed native ants, Camponotus spp., though neither native nor Argentine ant floral foraging was influenced by the EFNs. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed significant dissimilarity in arthropod communities on inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to inflorescences with native or no ants, with Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Arachnida, Orthoptera, and Blattaria all being underrepresented in inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to ant-excluded inflorescences. Native honeybees (Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz) spent 75% less time foraging on inflorescences with Argentine ants than on inflorescences without ants. Neither Argentine ant nor native ant visits to inflorescences had a detectable effect on seed set of Le. conocarpodendron. However, a pollen supplementation experiment revealed that like many other proteas, Le. conocarpodendron is not pollen-limited. Flower predation was negatively associated with increased ant visit frequency to the inflorescences, but did not differ among inflorescences visited by native and Argentine ants. Displacement of arthropods appears to be a consistent consequence of Argentine ant invasions. The displacement of floral arthropods by Argentine ants may have far-reaching consequences for this biodiversity hotspot and other regions that are rich in insect-pollinated plants.																		1366-9516	1472-4642		WOS:000252966500014

The plant section of the DAISIE database is based on national checklists from 48 European countries/regions and Israel; for many of them the data were compiled during the project and for some countries DAISIE collected the first comprehensive checklists of alien species, based on primary data (e.g., Cyprus, Greece, R Y. R. O. Macedonia, Slovenia, Ukraine). In total, the database contains records of 5789 alien plant species in Europe (including those native to a part of Europe but alien to another part), of which 2843 are alien to Europe (of extra-European origin). The research focus was on naturalized species; there are in total 3749 naturalized aliens in Europe, of which 1780 are alien to Europe. This represents a marked increase compared to 1568 alien species reported by a previous analysis of data in Flora Europaea (1964-1980). Casual aliens were marginally considered and are represented by 1507 species with European origins and 872 species whose native range falls outside Europe. The highest diversity of alien species is concentrated in industrialized countries with a tradition of good botanical recording or intensive recent research. The highest number of all alien species, regardless of status, is reported from Belgium (1969), the United Kingdom (1779) and Czech Republic (1378). The United Kingdom (857), Germany (450), Belgium (447) and Italy (440) are countries with the most naturalized neophytes. The number of naturalized neophytes in European countries is determined mainly by the interaction of temperature and precipitation; it increases with increasing precipitation but only in climatically warm and moderately warm regions. Of the nowadays naturalized neophytes alien to Europe, 50% arrived after 1899, 25% after 1962 and 10% after 1989. At present, approximately 6.2 new species, that are capable of naturalization, are arriving each year. Most alien species have relatively restricted European distributions; half of all naturalized species occur in four or fewer countries/regions, whereas 70% of non-naturalized species occur in only one region. Alien species are drawn from 213 families, dominated by large global plant families which have a weedy tendency and have undergone major radiations in temperate regions (Asteraceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae, Fabaceae, Brassicaceae). There are 1567 genera, which have alien members in European countries, the commonest being globally-diverse genera comprising mainly urban and agricultural weeds (e.g., Amaranthus, Chenopodium and Solanum) or cultivated for ornamental purposes (Cotoneaster, the genus richest in alien species). Only a few large genera which have successfully invaded (e.g., Oenothera, Oxalis, Panicum, Helianthus) are predominantly of non-European origin. Conyza canadensis, Helianthus tuberosus and Robinia pseudoacacia are most widely distributed alien species. Of all naturalized aliens present in Europe, 64.1% occur in industrial habitats and 58.5% on arable land and in parks and gardens. Grasslands and woodlands are also highly invaded, with 37.4 and 31.5%, respectively, of all naturalized aliens in Europe present in these habitats.Mires, bogs and fens are least invaded; only approximately 10% of aliens in Euope occur there. Intentional introductions to Europe (62.8% of the total number of naturalized aliens) prevail over unintentional (37.2%). Ornamental and horticultural introductions escaped from cultivation account for the highest number of species, 52.2% of the total. Among unintentional introductions, contaminants of seed, mineral materials and other commodities are responsible for 1091 alien species introductions to Europe (76.6% of all species introduced unintentionally) and 363 species are assumed to have arrived as stowaways (directly associated with human transport but arriving independently of commodity). Most aliens in Europe have a native range in the same continent (28.6% of all donor region records are from another part of Europe where the plant is native); in terms of species numbers the contribution of Europe as a region of origin is 53.2%. Considering aliens to Europe separately, 45.8% of species have their native distribution in North and South America, 45.9% in Asia, 20.7% in Africa and 5.3% in Australasia. Based on species composition, European alien flora can be classified into five major groups: (1) north-western, comprising Scandinavia and the UK; (2) west-central, extending from Belgium and the Netherlands to Germany and Switzerland; (3) Baltic, including only the former Soviet Baltic states; (4) east-central, comprizing the remainder of central and eastern Europe; (5) southern, covering the entire Mediterranean region. The clustering patterns cut across some European bioclimatic zones; cultural factors such as regional trade links and traditional local preferences for crop, forestry and ornamental species are also important by influencing the introduced species pool. Finally, the paper evaluates a state of the art in the field of plant invasions in Europe, points to research gaps and outlines avenues of further research towards documenting alien plant invasions in Europe. The data are of varying quality and need to be further assessed with respect to the invasion status and residence time of the species included. This concerns especially the naturalized/casual status; so far, this information is available comprehensively for only 19 countries/regions of the 49 considered. Collating an integrated database on the alien flora of Europe can form a principal contribution to developing a European-wide management strategy of alien species.																		0032-7786			WOS:000258002600001

Specifically, we ask if infestation influences (1) visitation rates and taxonomic composition of visitors to native flowers, and (2) the amount of conspecific pollen, number of pollen species, and proportion of heterospecific pollen on stigmas of native plants. We observed visits to selected native species during May and June 2000 and 2001. Stigmas were collected from a subsample of the flowers within these plots, squashed, and the pollen identified and counted under a light microscope. Visitation varied between years and among species of native plants: infestation had mixed effects in 2000 but visitation, especially by halictids was always lower within infestations in 2001. Despite differences in visitation between years, we found significantly less conspecific pollen on stigmas from infested plots in six of eight cases; we never found significantly more conspecific pollen on stigmas from within infestations. Our results emphasize the temporal variability in plant-pollinator relations and the added complexity imposed by an invasive species that will always make prediction of effects difficult. Nonetheless, the consistently lower conspecific pollen counts on native stigmas within infestations, regardless of visitation, suggest the likelihood of negative effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We then coupled these relationships with published trade forecasts to predict future invasion rates for insects, plant pathogens, and mollusks. Relationships between the accumulation of non-native species and merchandise imports were reasonably described by log-log and log-linear species-area models and Michaelis-Menten accumulation functions. However, the latter two models produced markedly better fits. When coupled with projected trade forecasts, the log-linear species-area model predicted 16-24% taxon-specific increases in the number of nonindigenous species established in the United States from 2000 to 2020. The Michaelis-Menten model predicted much lower 3-6% increases, but even this meant 115 new insect species and 5 new plant pathogens. These results suggest that the ecological and economic costs associated with human-caused biological invasions may continue to rise substantially over the coming decades.																		0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000180846200037

Better exploration of these processes is essential to understanding why exotic plants impact only certain systems, and why only some invaders have large impacts. Here, we review over 150 studies to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the impacts of exotic plant invasions on plant and animal community structure, nutrient cycling, hydrology and fire regimes. We find that, while numerous studies have examined the impacts of invasions on plant diversity and composition, less than 5% test whether these effects arise through competition, allelopathy, alteration of ecosystem variables or other processes. Nonetheless, competition was often hypothesized, and nearly all studies competing native and alien plants against each other found strong competitive effects of exotic species. In contrast to studies of the impacts on plant community structure and higher trophic, levels, research examining impacts on nitrogen cycling, hydrology and fire regimes is generally highly mechanistic, often motivated by specific invader traits. We encourage future studies that link impacts on community structure to ecosystem processes, and relate the controls over invasibility to the controls over impact.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000182400300001	12737654	
J	Liu, Hong; Pemberton, Robert W.								Solitary invasive orchid bee outperforms co-occurring native bees to promote fruit set of an invasive Solanum								OECOLOGIA				159	3			515	525		10.1007/s00442-008-1232-6				MAR 2009	2009	Our understanding of the effects of introduced invasive pollinators on plants has been exclusively drawn from studies on introduced social bees. One might expect, however, that the impacts of introduced solitary bees, with much lower population densities and fewer foragers, would be small. Yet little is known about the potential effects of naturalized solitary bees on the environment. We took advantage of the recent naturalization of an orchid bee, Euglossa viridissima, in southern Florida to study the effects of this solitary bee on reproduction of Solanum torvum, an invasive shrub. Flowers of S. torvum require specialized buzz pollination. Through timed floral visitor watches and two pollination treatments (control and pollen supplementation) at three forest edge and three open area sites, we found that the fruit set of S. torvum was pollen limited at the open sites where the native bees dominate, but was not pollen limited at the forest sites where the invasive orchid bees dominate. The orchid bee's pollination efficiency was nearly double that of the native halictid bees, and was also slightly higher than that of the native carpenter bee. Experiments using small and large mesh cages (to deny or allow E. viridissima access, respectively) at one forest site indicated that when the orchid bee was excluded, the flowers set one-quarter as many fruit as when the bee was allowed access. The orchid bee was the most important pollinator of the weed at the forest sites, which could pose additional challenges to the management of this weed in the fragmented, endangered tropical hardwood forests in the region. This specialized invasive mutualism may promote populations of both the orchid bee and this noxious weed. Invasive solitary bees, particularly species that are specialized pollinators, appear to have more importance than has previously been recognized.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000263418800005	19066971

Progress in invasion studies hinges on the following research trends: realization that species' ranges are naturally dynamic; recognition that colonist species and target communities cannot be studied independently, but that species-community interactions determine invasion success; increasingly quantitative tests of how species and habitat characteristics relate to invasibility and impact; recognition from paleobiological, experimental and modeling studies that history, chance and determinism together shape community invasibility.																		0169-5347			WOS:A1993KU68100006	21236129

Visitation and pollen transport networks were constructed to compare replicated I. glandulifera invaded and I. glandulifera removal plots. Invaded plots had significantly higher visitor species richness, visitor abundance and flower visitation. However, the pollen transport networks were dominated by alien pollen grains in the invaded plots and consequently higher visitation may not translate in facilitation for pollination. The more generalized insects were more likely to visit the alien plant, and Hymenoptera and Hemiptera were more likely to visit the alien than Coleoptera. Our data indicate that generalized native pollinators can provide a pathway of integration for alien plants into native visitation systems.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000247123900001	17542933

We restrict our focus to services provided by "wild" insects; we do riot include services from domesticated or mass-reared insect species. The four insect services for which we provide value estimates-dung burial, pest control, pollination, and wildlife nutrition-were chosen not because of their importance but because of the availability of data and an algorithm for their estimation. We base our estimations of the value of each service oil projections of losses that would accrue if insects were not functioning at their current level. We estimate the annual value of these ecological services provided in the United States to be at least $57 billion, all amount that justifies greater investment in the conservation of these services.																		0006-3568	1525-3244		WOS:000236750500011

We explored probable patterns of extinction in two large networks of plants and flower visitors by simulating the removal of pollinators and consequent loss of the plants that depend upon them for reproduction. For each network, we removed pollinators at random, systematically from least-linked (most specialized) to most-linked (most generalized), and systematically from most- to least-linked. Plant species diversity declined most rapidly with preferential removal of the most-linked pollinators, but declines were no worse than linear. This relative tolerance to extinction derives from redundancy in pollinators per plant and from nested topology of the networks. Tolerance in pollination networks contrasts with catastrophic declines reported from standard food webs. The discrepancy may be a result of the method used: previous studies removed species from multiple trophic levels based only on their linkage, whereas our preferential removal of pollinators reflects their greater risk of extinction relative to that of plants. In both pollination networks, the most-linked pollinators were bumble-bees and some solitary bees. These animals should receive special attention in efforts to conserve temperate pollination systems.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000226419100011	15615687

We extend the scope of recent 'single species' studies by analysing how alien plant species integrate themselves into a native flower visitation web. Historical records for a community in central USA show that 456 plant species received visits from 1429 insect and 1 hummingbird species, yielding 15 265 unique interactions. Aliens comprised 12.3% of all plant species, whereas only a few insects were alien. On average, the flowers of alien plants were visited by significantly fewer animal species than those of native plants. Most of these visitors were generalists, visiting many other plant species. The web of interactions between flowers and visitors was less richly connected for alien plants than for natives; nonetheless, aliens were well integrated into the native web. Because most visitors appear to be pollinators, this integration implies possible competitive and facilitative interactions between native and alien plants, mediated through animal visitors to flowers.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000180108400002	12495480

We created a database of the alien plants in seminatural habitats in Ireland that included data on taxonomy, invasive status, invasion history, distribution, and biological and ecological plant characteristics. We used information from this database to determine the importance of these factors in increasing the ability of species to become naturalized and invasive. More specifically, we used two multiple logistic regressions toy factors that distinguish naturalized from casual alien plant species and invasive from noninvasive, identify naturalized alien species. Clonal growth, moisture-indicator value, nitrogen-indicator value, native range, and date of first record affected (in order of decreasing importance) the probability of naturalization. Factors that distinguished invasive from noninvasive species were ornamental introduction, hermaphrodite flowers, pollination mode, being invasive elsewhere, onset of flowering season, moisture-indicator value, native range, and date of first record. Incorporation of phylogenetic information had little influence on the results, suggesting that the capacity of alien species to naturalize and become invasive evolved largely independently in several phylogenetic lineages. Whereas some of the variables were important for both transitions, others were only important for naturalization or for invasion. This emphasizes the importance of studying different stages of the invasion process when looking for mechanisms of becoming a successful invasive plant, instead of simply comparing invasive with noninvasive alien species. Our results also suggest that a combination of species traits and other variables is likely to produce the most accurate prediction of invasions.																		0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000254796800014	18261149	
J	Moller, H								Lessons for invasion theory from social insects								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				78	1-2			125	142		10.1016/0006-3207(96)00022-5				OCT-NOV 1996	1996	Reproductive and dispersal modes of social insects mean that fundamentally different models may be required for predicting determinants of their invasions from those for sexually reproducing non-social animals or non-insects. This suggests that it is unrealistic to expect the same predictors of invasiveness will apply to all biota. Many species of social wasps, bees and ants are extraordinarily invasive. The main general advantage promoting invasiveness of social insects may be the flexibilities arising from having both individual and colony responses that enable them to withstand biotic resistance and to better match conditions in the receiving community. Social insect invasion case studies have revealed strong evidence for biotic resistance to invasions in some instances. Intercorrelated species characters and ecological variations in different disturbance regimes, regions, habitats and community histories hamper further advances in the understanding of invasion biology from comparing invasive and non-invasive species. Mole incorporation of models of conservation biology, community ecology and genetics may assist invasion biology. Experimentally designed release programmes and detailed follow-up studies of biological control agents could greatly assist the quest for better invasion models. More prolonged invasion case studies, where the underlying mechanisms of invasion are researched, and experimental manipulations are the best way that a more robust and predictive theory oof invasions can be generated. Social insects provide splendid opportunities for such research. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited																		0006-3207	1873-2917		WOS:A1996VP46800011

We explore the nature of these recent biotic exchanges and their consequences on evolutionary processes. The direct evidence of evolutionary consequences of the biotic rearrangements is of variable quality, but the results of trajectories are becoming clear as the number of studies increases. There are examples of invasive species altering the evolutionary pathway of native species by competitive exclusion, niche displacement, hybridization, introgression, predation, and ultimately extinction. Invaders themselves evolve in response to their interactions with natives, as well as in response to the new abiotic environment. Flexibility in behavior, and mutualistic interactions, can aid in the success of invaders in their new environment.

In the present study, we hypothesized that the showy flowers of the highly invasive Carpobrotu spp. can compete with native species (Cistus monspeliensis, Cistus salviifolius, Anthyllis cytisoides and Lotus cytisoides) with which it shares habitat and flowering time, influencing pollinator visitation. To test this, we censused insects visiting the flowers of native species in the field and recorded the number of flowers visited in adjacent areas with and without the presence of Carpobrotus. We also assessed the presence of exotic pollen on stigmas of native species and evaluated its effect on reproduction. We detected potential competition for pollinators only in one native species (L. cytisoides), a facilitative effect in two other species (C. salviifolius and A. cytisoides), and a neutral effect in a fourth one (C. monspeliensis). Moreover, such effects appear not to be consistent in time. The presence of Carpobrotus pollen on native stigmas was almost negligible, and hand-pollination experiments showed that such exotic pollen does not interfere significantly with native pollen, not affecting seed set. Our results indicate that the role of the invasive Carpobrotus in promoting or constraining the natural pollination dynamics is likely to have species specific effects on the native flora.

J	Morales, Carolina L.								Introduction of no native bumblebees (Bombus): causes, ecological consequences and perspectives				Introduccion de abejorros (Bombus) no nativos: causas, consecuencias ecologicas y perspectivas				Ecologia Austral				17	1			51	65						JAN-JUN 2007	2007	The invasion of non native pollinators might have considerable impacts on native pollinators, native and introduced plants. In this article I analyze the causes of introduction of bumblebees (Bombus), the factors favoring the invasion and the distribution of introduced species. I also review the studies about their ecological impact, discussing the limitations of those studies, and the main gaps in knowledge. Five bumblebee species are established outside their native ranges, as a consequence of intentional releases and the trade of colonies. Introduced bumblebees are highly polylecthic and could acquire high abundances in invaded areas, dominating in some cases the anthophyllous communities. In general, they gather resources more efficiently than natives, and despite a substantial overlap in the use of floral resources, in general both groups mutually exclude in time and space, suggesting the potential for competition; nevertheless no study has experimentally tested this hypothesis. The introduction of bumblebees could favor the introduction and transmission of pathogens. Non native bumblebees are less efficient pollinators of some native plants than natives and, in general, they prefer non native plant species, contributing to the pollination of important weeds, although their influence on weed invasion process has not been tested. Under experimental conditions some species of non native bumblebees can mate with native congeners; nevertheless no hybridization has been reported in the wild. The evidence of the impact of non native bumblebees on native ecosystems is scarce, fragmented and preliminary. In spite of them, considering the overall available evidence I strongly recommend the application of the precautionary principle to analyze potential future introductions.																		1667-782X	1667-782X		BCI:BCI200900473299

Using multivariate techniques, we examined the structure of a plant-pollinator web comprising both alien and native plants and flower visitors in the temperate forests of north-west Patagonia, Argentina. Our main objective was to assess whether plant species origin (alien or native) influences the composition of flower visitor assemblages. We also examined the influence of other potential confounding intrinsic factors such as flower symmetry and colour, and extrinsic factors such as flowering time, site and habitat disturbance.2 Flowers of alien and native plant species were visited by a similar number of species and proportion of insects from different orders, but the composition of the assemblages of flower-visiting species differed between alien and native plants.3 The influence of plant species origin on the composition of flower visitor assemblages persisted after accounting for other significant factors such as flowering time, bearing red corollas, and habitat disturbance. This influence was at least in part determined by the fact that alien flower visitors were more closely associated with alien plants than with native plants. The main native flower visitors were, on average, equally associated with native and alien plant species.4 In spite of representing a minor fraction of total species richness (3.6% of all species), alien flower visitors accounted for > 20% of all individuals recorded on flowers. Thus, their high abundance could have a significant impact in terms of pollination.5 The mutualistic web of alien plants and flower-visiting insects is well integrated into the overall community-wide pollination web. However, in addition to their use of the native biota, invasive plants and flower visitors may benefit from differential interactions with their alien partners. The existence of these invader complexes could contribute to the spread of aliens into novel environments.																		0022-0477	1365-2745		WOS:000234028800016

Concern has been expressed that it might act as an invasive species with large impact on biodiversity. However, although the honeybee has spread into the wild and has established feral populations in Australia and the Americas, the extent to which introduced honeybees alter biodiversity remains controversial. Here we focus on the best documented cases of A. mellifera invasions and discuss the effects on biodiversity under three different conditions: 1) regions where other subspecies of A. mellifera are endemic (Europe, Africa, and western Asia), 2) regions where A. mellifera is not endemic, but other species of Apis naturally occur (central and eastern Asia), 3) regions where Apis species are not endemic (America, Australia). Although some studies show an impact on native bee survival, fecundity, or population density in response to large A. mellifera aggregations (e.g., on apiaries), there are no reports that feral honeybees caused the extinction of native bee pollinators, which are the most likely competing group of organisms. Honeybee introductions have had or still may have negative effects only within the genus Apis, primarily interfering with beekeeping activities. Although honeybee invasions seem to have had little if any effect on biodiversity of native pollinators so far, we nevertheless caution against transporting honeybees around the globe, and we particularly advise against importing foreign Apis species into tropical ecosystems.																		1195-6860	2376-7626		WOS:000232582200002

Alien invasive plants possessing attractive flowers can affect the interactions between native plants and their pollinators. The few studies conducted so far have reported positive, negative and neutral effects of the presence of an invasive species on the pollinator visitation rates and seed output of native species. However, the role played by the density of the alien species has been seldom explored.2. While high densities of the invasive species can negatively effect the pollinator visitation rates and seed output of the native species, due to sequestration of pollinators by the invasive species, at lower densities the invasive can attract pollinators that otherwise would not visit patches of native species, positively affecting their reproduction.3. Using observations and pollinator exclusions at a site at 2800 m altitude in the central Chilean Andes, we show that the alien herb Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae), possessing showy floral capitula, shares pollinators to a high degree (> 90%) with two co-occurring native Asteraceae: Hypochaeris thrincioides and Perezia carthamoides. Pollinator exclusion indicated that both natives are highly dependent on insect visitation to produce seeds.4. Using manipulative supplemental hand-pollination and experiments, where we varied the density of T. officinale, we determined that seed output in H. thrincioides and P. carthamoides is pollen-limited and that its magnitude is not affected by the presence of the exotic. Further, while the presence of one individual of T. officinale around focal native individuals showed neutral or facilitative effects on pollinator service or seed output in the two native species, the presence of five individuals of T. officinale negatively affected these reproductive variables.5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the effects of the presence of alien invasive plant species with attractive flowers vary with their density. This demonstrates the need to experimentally test for the potential impacts of introduced species at different densities before prematurely coming to conclusions regarding their assumed negative or positive effects in native ecosystems.																		0022-0477	1365-2745		WOS:000254951400006

As evidence for bee declines is now accumulating from over broad taxonomic and geographic scales, we review the role of ecology in bee conservation at the levels of species, populations and communities. Bee populations and communities are typified by considerable spatiotemporal variation; whereby autecological traits, population size and growth rate, and plant-pollinator network architecture all play a role in their vulnerability to extinction. As contemporary insect conservation management is broadly based on species- and habitat-targeted approaches, ecological data will be central to integrating management strategies into a broader, landscape scale of dynamic, interconnected habitats capable of delivering bee conservation in the context of global environmental change.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000267832600003

We examined the effects of land use and bumblebee abundance on the number and body size of bumblebees collected using window traps in a lowland area in the southern Ishikari district, Hokkaido. In 2004, we collected 922 bumblebees of six species using 70 traps at 17 sites. A statistical model fitted to the data demonstrated that dispersion from commercial B. terrestris colonies used in greenhouses positively affected the number of B. terrestris caught by each trap. This exotic species was abundant in sites where paddy fields were prevalent, but three native species, B. hypocrita, B. ardens, and B. diversus, were abundant in sites where farms and woodlands were widespread. The local abundance of B. terrestris was not associated negatively with the number and body size of native bumblebees. Thus, we did not find any competitive interactions between exotic and native bumblebees although habitat conditions seem to be common determinants of the bumblebee populations. A morphological analysis showed that B. terrestris had intermediate tongue length between B. hypocrita and B. ardens.																		0912-3814			WOS:000244483400019

This study focuses on the invasive Heracleum mantegazzianum and distance-dependent effects on pollination of Mimulus guttatus in abandoned grassland over 2 years. First, we examined pollinator abundance in yellow traps at 0, 10, 30 and 60-200 m from H. mantegazzianum. We then placed M. guttatus plants at the same distances to monitor effects of the invasive species on pollinator visitation and seed set of neighbouring plants. Finally, we conducted a garden experiment to test if deposition of H. mantegazzianum pollen reduces seed set in M. guttatus. No distance effect was found for the number of bumblebees in traps, although the invasive species attracted a diverse assemblage of insects, and visitation of M. guttatus was enhanced close to H. mantegazzianum. This positive effect was not reflected by seed set of M. guttatus, and heterospecific pollen decreased seed set in these plants. Overall there is little evidence for negative effects of the invasive species on pollination of neighbouring plants, and flower visitation even increases close to the invaded patches. The functional role of the invader and suitable control strategies need further clarification, since removal of H. mantegazzianum may actually damage local pollinator populations.																		1387-3547	1573-1464		WOS:000260306700016

Foraging range is a key aspect of the ecology of 'central place foragers'. Estimating how far bees fly under different circumstances is essential for predicting colony success, and for estimating bee-mediated gene flow between plant populations. It is likely to be strongly influenced by forage distribution, something that is hard to quantify in all but the simplest landscapes; and theories of foraging distance tend to assume a homogeneous forage distribution.2. We quantified the distribution of bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. foragers away from experimentally positioned colonies, in an agricultural landscape, using two methods. We mass-marked foragers as they left the colony, and analysed pollen from foragers returning to the colonies. The data were set within the context of the 'forage landscape': a map of the spatial distribution of forage as determined from remote-sensed data. To our knowledge, this is the first time that empirical data on foraging distances and forage availability, at this resolution and scale, have been collected and combined for bumblebees.3. The bees foraged at least 1.5 km from their colonies, and the proportion of foragers flying to one field declined, approximately linearly, with radial distance. In this landscape there was great variation in forage availability within 500 m of colonies but little variation beyond 1 km, regardless of colony location.4. The scale of B. terrestris foraging was large enough to buffer against effects of forage patch and flowering crop heterogeneity, but bee species with shorter foraging ranges may experience highly variable colony success according to location.																		0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000252810400025	17986207	
J	Otterstatter, Michael C.; Thomson, James D.					Otterstatter, Michael/0000-0001-5489-014X			Does Pathogen Spillover from Commercially Reared Bumble Bees Threaten Wild Pollinators?								PLOS ONE				3	7					e2771	10.1371/journal.pone.0002771				JUL 23 2008	2008	The conservation of insect pollinators is drawing attention because of reported declines in bee species and the 'ecosystem services' they provide. This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called, 'Colony Collapse Disorder'); yet, we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen 'spillover' from commercially reared bumble bees, which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops, is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and, using laboratory experiments and the literature, estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi, a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover, and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that, during the first three months of spillover, transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However, a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly, infecting up to 35-100% of wild Bombus, and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk. In the field, although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection, the prevalences of C. bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model. Indeed, we found that spillover has allowed C. bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses. Given the available evidence, it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild Bombus in North America. Improved management of domestic bees, for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners, could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover.																		1932-6203			WOS:000264302900041	18648661

To date its pathology and impact on host fitness are not well understood. We performed a laboratory experiment investigating the pathology and fitness effects of this parasite on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We experimentally infected one group of colonies with N. bombi spores at the start of the worker production, while a second uninfected group of colonies served as controls. During colony development we collected live workers for dissections to measure infection intensities. In parallel, we measured several life history traits, to investigate costs to the host. We succeeded in infecting 11 of 16 experimental colonies. When infection occurred at an early stage of colony development, virtually all individuals were infected, with spores being found in a number of tissues, and the functional fitness of males and young queens was reduced to zero. Further, the survival of workers from infected colonies and infected males were reduced. With such severe effects, N. bombi appears to decrease its opportunities for transmission to the next host generation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Although much debate has taken place regarding the possible impact of honey bees on Australian native bees, there has been little direct research. This study presents the results of a replicated Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) experiment simulating the putative impact of feral honey bees on an undescribed species of Australian solitary bee (Megachile sp. M323/F367). Although a large resource overlap occurred between the two species, there was no significant change in the reproductive success of the native bee. The realised precision of the experiment was assessed and showed appropriate sensitivity for three important reproductive variables. The native bee, being better adapted to the high summer temperatures experienced during the period of this experiment, may be able to withstand honey bee competition.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000235837400008

The introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) is an example of a species that can compete with native bees for floral resources. Often, research into honey bee/native bee competition has focused on floral resource overlap, visitation rates or resource harvesting, and any negative interaction has been interpreted as a negative impact. Although this research can be valuable in indicating the potential for competition between honey bees and native bees, to determine if the long-term survival of a native bee species is threatened, fecundity, survival or population density needs to be assessed. The present review evaluates research that has investigated all these measurements of honey bee/native bee competition and finds that many studies have problems with sample size, confounding factors or data interpretation. Guidelines for future research include increasing replication and using long-term studies to investigate the impact of both commercial and feral honey bees.																		1442-9985	1442-9993		WOS:000223057500005

This study reports the results of an experiment run over two years on the impact of commercial honey bees on the fecundity of a solitary native bee, Hylaeus alcyoneus. Registered apiary sites were used as treatment sites (with honey bees) while control sites (without honey bees) were interspersed between. The fecundity of H. alcyoneus was measured using trap nests. We compared the number of nests produced, number of eggs per nest and emerging progeny mass of H. aleyoneus in sites with and without commercial bee hives. The number of nests produced by H. alcyoneus was 23% less (Wilcoxon's T) at treatment sites than control sites. Analysis of individual measurement intervals using ANOVA was compromised by a general lack of power. This result highlights that even though honey bees have been present in certain areas for many years, competition with native bees may still be occurring. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Biological Invasions				1	1			3	19		10.1023/A:1010034312781				1999	1999	Although ecologists commonly talk about the impacts of nonindigenous species, little formal attention has been given to defining what we mean by impact, or connecting ecological theory with particular measures of impact. The resulting lack of generalizations regarding invasion impacts is more than an academic problem; we need to be able to distinguish invaders with minor effects from those with large effects in order to prioritize management efforts. This paper focuses on defining, evaluating and comparing a variety of measures of impact drawn from empirical examples and theoretical reasoning. The authors begin by arguing that the total impact of an invader includes 3 fundamental dimensions: range, abundance and the per-capita or per-biomass effect of the invader. Previous approaches to measuring impact at different organizational levels are summarized, and some new approaches suggested. Reviewing mathematical models of impact, it is argued that theoretical studies using community assembly models could act as a basis for better empirical studies and monitoring programmes, as well as provide a clearer understanding of the relationship among different types of impact. Some of the particular challenges that come from the need to prioritize invasive species in a management or policy context are then discussed. Recommendations are given about how the field of invasion biology might proceed in order to build a general framework for understanding and predicting impacts. In particular, studies designed to explore the correlations among different measures are advocated: Are the results of complex multivariate methods adequately captured by simple composite metrics such as species richness? How well are impacts on native populations correlated with impacts on ecosystem functions? Are there useful bioindicators for invasion impacts? To what extent does the impact of an invasive species depend on the system in which it is measured? Three approaches would provide new insights in this line of inquiry: (1) studies that measure impacts at multiple scales and multiple levels of organization, (2) studies that synthesize currently available data on different response variables, and (3) models designed to guide empirical work and explore generalities.

A shortage of mutualists could potentially limit the rate of population growth for an invading species. The introduced shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom, Leguminosae) is a pest plant on the west coast of North America. It produces flowers that are ''tripped'' open when pollinated and has a nearly obligatory relationship with resident bumble bees and honey bees. Experiments in the state of Washington showed that <1% of untripped flowers produced fruits and that outcross-pollinated flowers yielded fourfold more fruit than self-pollinated flowers, revealing apparent inbreeding depression. Mean pollinator visitation rate, as determined by the proportion of flowers tripped, varied among three years and among four populations but was low (3-30%) in every case. Two urban populations (Magnuson Park and Discovery Park in Seattle) received higher numbers of visits than two native prairie populations (Johnson Prairie and 13th Division Prairie in southwestern Washington). Hand-pollination experiments revealed significant pollinator limitation in all populations in both 1993 and 1994, with the mean increase in fruit production ranging from 280 to 2620%. Prairie populations were more pollinator limited than urban populations. Resources available for per-flower fruit production appeared to be equally available in all populations in 1993 but more available in prairie populations than in urban populations in 1994. The relationship between natural visitation and proportion fruit set per branch was a saturating curve in 1993 but a linear function in 1994 and 1995. Significant correlations were found between pollinator visitation and variation in whole-plant fruit production in all 3 yr. No evidence was found for either (1) reallocation of resources between branches within a season, or (2) a cost of reproduction between seasons in plants receiving supplemental pollen. Demographic analysis showed that a very large cost of reproduction would be required to counterbalance the increase in fecundity achieved with full pollination. Simulations of new populations invading over a short time scale (10-30 yr) demonstrated little effect of pollen limitation in the slow-growing urban populations, but a potentially large effect of increasing pollinator visitation in the rapidly invading prairie populations.																		0012-9658			WOS:A1997XK92900017

We estimated the population of these three species, For B. hortorum and B. wurflenii, the total workers populations foraging on Aconitum spp. ranged from 101 to 523 and 156 to 270, respectively. These two species also forage on other plants while B. gerstaeckeri visits only Aconitum spp. The population of B. gerstaeckeri observed was extremely small, founded by 33 queens only in 2001. With a total number of workers estimated from 40 to 102, the observed workers/queens ratio, 1 to 3 workers for each queen, is very unusual for a eusocial species. Also we observed queens foraging during the whole life of the colony. This kind of social organisation is similar to that of some high arctic species. It could be interpreted as the result of an insularity syndrome.																		0037-9271	2168-6351		WOS:000240389200007

Our aim was to answer the following questions: Do young and old nature reserves contain the same proportion of invasive plant species? Does the time of their introduction affect their representation in these reserves? We obtained recent lists of vascular plant species for 302 reserves established since 1838 and designated the species as native or alien. We divided the latter category into archaeophytes and neophytes, introduced before and after 1500, respectively. The increase in the number of reserves and species was evaluated by inclusion curves. For inclusion curves describing an increase in the number of reserves, the estimated time of 50% inclusion indicated when half the reserves of a particular type were established. For inclusion curves describing an increase in the number of species, the estimated time of 50% inclusion indicated when half the species of a particular category (native species, all aliens, archaeophytes, neophytes), reported from the country, were included in the nature reserves. The forest and dry-grassland reserves were established earlier than those in wetlands and peat bogs, whereas humid-grassland reserves tended to be the most recently established. Half the native species were included significantly earlier ( after 25 years) than half of alien species (86 years), and half the neophytes were included later ( 143 years) than half the archaeophytes (31 years). Early reserves harbor a significantly lower number of alien species than those established later. These reserves include a higher proportion of the Czech Republic's native species and archaeophytes than of its neophytes. There was no difference in the relative rates of inclusion of native species, archaeophytes, and neophytes. However, the fact that the same inclusion rate applies to neophytes, a group with an increasing species pool, as to archaeophytes and native species, which both have constant species pools, suggests that natural vegetation in nature reserves is an effective barrier against the establishment of alien species. On a historical time scale, the early establishment of nature reserves in a given country decreases the probability that the reserve will be invaded by alien plants.																		0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000185473000026

The relation between invasion success and type of recipient habitat was studied in the Slavkovsky les hilly ridge, Czech Republic. The vegetation of 14 habitat types a occurring in an area of ca. 25 km(2) was analysed using phytosociological releves, and the invasion success of Heracleum (in terms of number of localities, area covered and proportion of available area occupied) was recorded separately in each of them. Site conditions were expressed indirectly using Ellenberg indicator values. The hypothesis tested was that Heracleum spreads in the majority of vegetation types regardless of the properties of the recipient vegetation.Community invasibility appeared to be affected by site conditions and the composition of the recipient vegetation. The species is not found in acidic habitats. Disturbed habitats with good possibilities of dispersal for Heracleum seeds are more easily invaded. Communities with a higher proportion of phanerophytes and of species with CS (Competitive/Stress-tolerating) strategy were more resistant to invasion. The invasion success was bigger in sites with increased possibilities of spread for Heracleum diaspores. Communities invaded by Heracleum had a lower species diversity and a higher indicator value for nitrogen than not-invaded stands. It appears that species contributing to community resistance against invasion of Heracleum, or capable of persisting in Heracleum-invaded stands, have similar ecological requirements but a different life strategy to the invader.																		1100-9233			WOS:A1995TK02800012

Mutualisms involving animal-mediated pollination and seed dispersal, and symbioses between plant roots and microbiota often facilitate invasions. The spread of many alien plants, particularly woody ones, depends on pollinator mutualisms. Most alien plants are well served by generalist pollinators (insects and birds), and pollinator limitation does not appear to be a major barrier for the spread of introduced plants (special conditions relating to Ficus and orchids are described). Seeds of many of the most notorious plant invaders are dispersed by animals, mainly birds and mammals. Our review supports the view that tightly coevolved, plant-vertebrate seed dispersal systems are extremely rare. Vertebrate-dispersed plants are generally not limited reproductively by the lack of dispersers. Most mycorrhizal plants form associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi which, because of their low specificity, do not seem to play a major role in facilitating or hindering plant invasions (except possibly on remote islands such as the Galapagos which are poor in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). The lack of symbionts has, however, been a major barrier for many ectomycorrhizal plants, notably for Pinus spp. in parts of the southern hemisphere. The roles of nitrogen-fixing associations between legumes and rhizobia and between actinorhizal plants and Frankia spp. in promoting or hindering invasions have been virtually ignored in the invasions literature. Symbionts required to induce nitrogen fixation in many plants are extremely widespread, but intentional introductions of symbionts have altered the invasibility of many, if not most, systems. Some of the world's worst invasive alien species only invaded after the introduction of symbionts. Mutualisms in the new environment sometimes re-unite the same species that form partnerships in the native range of the plant. Very often, however, different species are involved, emphasizing the diffuse nature of many (most) mutualisms. Mutualisms in new habitats usually duplicate functions or strategies that exist in the natural range of the plant. Occasionally, mutualisms forge totally novel combinations, with profound implications for the behaviour of the introduced plant in the new environment (examples are seed dispersal mutualisms involving wind-dispersed pines and cockatoos in Australia; and mycorrhizal associations involving plant roots and fungi). Many ecosystems are becoming more susceptible to invasion by introduced plants because: (a) they contain an increasing array of potential mutualistic partners (e.g. generalist frugivores and pollinators, mycorrhizal fungi with wide host ranges, rhizobia strains with infectivity across genera); and (b) conditions conducive for the establishment of various alien/alien synergisms are becoming more abundant. Incorporating perspectives on mutualisms in screening protocols will improve (but not perfect) our ability to predict whether a given plant species could invade a particular habitat.

J	Roubik, DW								Ups and downs in pollinator populations: When is there a decline?								CONSERVATION ECOLOGY				5	1					2					JUN 2001	2001	Plant-pollinator systems inherently possess wide variation that limits the applicability of surveys on population dynamics or diversity. Stable habitats are scarcely studied, whereas dynamics in unprotected habitats are less predictable or more compromised by exotic organisms (Apis, in the case of bee surveys). An extensively replicated, long-term study of orchid-bees (Euglossini) was made in protected tropical moist forest in Panama. Over 47,000 bees were recorded in 124 monthly censuses employing 1952 counts. No aggregate trend in abundance occurred (from 1979 to 2000), although four individual species declined, nine increased, 23 showed no change, and species richness was stable. No rare or parasitic species showed decreasing trends, while the most common of the set of bee species studied gradually declined. Biodiversity therefore increased. Recorded variability included 300% (fourfold) differences in bee abundance among years, and changes in species abundance up to 14-fold. Surveys in dry and wet seasons (N = 17 and 18 years, 29 and 31 species, respectively) indicated no numerical changes in the bee assemblage over 21 years. El-Ni (n) over tildeo climatic events led to brief increases in bee abundance. This detailed survey is deconstructed to assess sampling rigor and strategies, particularly considering the recorded local differences within a single forest.Year-to-year shifts in bee abundance for three tropical and five temperate bee censuses were comparable. In short studies (2-4 years) and during longer studies (17-21 years), 59 species that included solitary, social, and highly social bees had mean abundances that varied by factors of 2.06 for temperate bees and 2.16 for tropical bees. "Normal" bee populations commonly halved or doubled in 1-yr intervals. Longer term data are only available for the tropics. Stochastic variation and limitations of monitoring methods suggest that minimum series of four years (i.e., three intervals) of several counts during the active season may demonstrate genuine trends. Longer term, continuous studies are still needed for meaningful insights on pollinator population shifts in nature.																		1195-5449			WOS:000170221500004

Honey bees appeared in light traps as the first swarms colonized the Panama Canal area. Their numbers followed seasonal trends shown in independent studies, thus indicating bee abundance and activity in a large area. No measurable population-level impact of competition between this invading honey bee and native bees, despite many demonstrations of resource competition at flower patch and colony levels, changed annual abundances of all 15 native bee species. Native bee abundance did not decrease, nor did native bees show substantial reciprocal yearly change with honey bee abundance. One strong negative correlation of bee catches with an extremely rainy year was found. However, multiple regression using rainfall and honey bee abundance as the independent variables showed that neither was responsible for bee population change over 17 years. Nearly half the native species declined during a year that displayed peak honey bee number. That competition from honey bees on an island the size of BCI was necessarily reduced below impact levels expected on the mainland is discussed using a model of resource and consumer density, foraging range, and island size.																		1438-3896	1438-390X		WOS:000169145300008

Most pollen proteins are likely to be enzymes that function during pollen tube growth and subsequent fertilization, but the vast range of protein quantity may not reflect only pollen-pistil interactions. Because numerous vertebrate and invertebrate floral visitors consume pollen for protein, protein content may influence floral host choice. Additionally, many floral visitors pollinate their host plants. If protein content influences pollinator visitation, then pollinators are hypothesized to select for increased protein content of host plants. We analyzed or gleaned from the literature crude pollen protein concentrations of 377 plant species from 93 plant families. Using this database, we compared pollen protein concentration with (1) pollination mode, (2) pollen collection by bees, and (3) distance from stigma to ovule, after accounting for phylogeny through paired phylogenetic comparisons and a nested ANOVA including taxonomic rank. We found that pollen protein concentrations were highly conserved within plant genera, families, and divisions. We found that bees did not collect pollen that was unusually rich in protein, whether they pollinated or merely robbed their host plant. Plant species with vibratile pollination systems, which require visitation by pollen-collecting bees in order to transfer pollen, tended to have very protein-rich pollen, but it was not clear whether this was due to plant enhancement of pollinator rewards or to the possession of very small pollen grains. We found that zoophilous species were not statistically richer in pollen protein than anemophilous species after accounting for phylogeny, although the three most species-rich anemophilous clades surveyed were generally poor in protein. Plant genera hosting specialist pollen-collecting bees did not have particularly protein-rich pollen. Both mass of protein per pollen grain and pollen grain volume were correlated with stigma-ovule distance. We suggest that the need for growing pollen tubes probably plays a more important role in determining pollen protein content than rewarding pollinators.																		0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000165521600005

This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably wilt have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.																		0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000085775300030	10710299

On average 19-29 % of infections were successful and no significant differences among these host categories were found. Different sources of Nosema spores differed in their success in infecting different host colonies, suggesting genotype-genotype interactions at the level of colonies and parasite sources. In a second experiment, N. bombi obtained from B. terrestris were found to be infective for workers of B. lapidarius and B. hypnorum, although less so in these foreign hosts. On the other hand, case mortality was significantly higher in foreign hosts than in B. terrestris. Infection and high spore loads correlated with early death of the host. In addition, a factorial analysis showed that variation among-colonies-within-species explained more of the variation in infection success than the factor species per se.

The African bee therefore provides an excellent opportunity to examine the factors that influence invasion success. We provide a synthesis of recent research on the African bee, concentrating on its ability to displace European honey bees. Specifically, we consider (a) the genetic composition of the expanding population and the symmetry) of gene flow between African and European bees, (b) the mechanisms that favor the preservation of the African genome, and (c) the possible range and impact of the African bee in the United States.																		0066-4170	1545-4487		WOS:000188826400016	14651468

The small hive beetle, Aethina tumida, is a parasite of honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies native to sub-Saharan Africa and has become an invasive species. In North America the beetle is now sympatric with bumblebees, Bombus, not occurring in its native range. Laboratory studies have shown that small hive beetles can reproduce in bumblebee colonies but it was not known whether infestations occur in the field.2. For the first time, infestation of bumblebee colonies by small hive beetles was investigated in the field. Commercial Bombus impatiens colonies (n = 10) were installed in proximity to infested apiaries. Within 8 weeks, all colonies that were alive in the 5-week observation period (n = 9) became naturally infested with adult small hive beetles and successful small hive beetle reproduction occurred in five colonies.3. In four-square choice tests, the beetles were attracted to both adult bumblebee workers and pollen from bumblebee nests, suggesting that these odours may serve as cues for host finding.4. The data indicate that bumblebee colonies may serve as alternative hosts for small hive beetles in the field. To foster the conservation of these essential native pollinators, investigations on the actual impact of small hive beetles on wild bumblebee populations are suggested.																		0307-6946			WOS:000242862600011

We analysed, for the first time to the best of the authors' knowledge, foraging distances and dance activities of honeybees in relation to landscape structure, season and colony using a replicated experimental approach on a landscape scale. We compared three structurally simple landscapes characterized by a high proportion of arable land and large patches, with three complex landscapes with a high proportion of semi-natural perennial habitats and low mean patch size. Four observation hives were placed in the centre of the landscapes and switched at regular intervals between the six landscapes from the beginning of May to the end of July.A total of 1137 bee dances were observed and decoded. Overall mean foraging distance was 1526.1 +/- 37.2 m, the median 1181.5 m and range 62.1-10 037.1 m. Mean foraging distances of all bees and foraging distances of nectar-collecting bees did not significantly differ between simple and complex landscapes, but varied between month and colonies. Foraging distances of pollen-collecting bees were significantly larger in simple (1743 +/- 95.6 m) than in complex landscapes (1543.4 +/- 71 m) and highest in June when resources were scarce. Dancing activity, i.e. the number of observed bee dances per unit time, was significantly higher in complex than in simple landscapes, presumably because of larger spatial and temporal variability of resource patches in complex landscapes. The results facilitate an understanding of how human landscape modification may change the evolutionary significance of bee dances and ecological interactions, such as pollination and competition between honeybees and other bee species.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000181769800003	12769455

Potential ecological consequences of invasion of non-native pollinators include increased pollination and seed set of invasive plants, with subsequent impacts on population growth rates and rates of spread. We outline a quantitative approach for evaluating the impact of a proposed introduction of an invasive pollinator on existing weed population dynamics and demonstrate the use of this approach on a relatively data-rich case study: the impacts on Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) from proposed introduction of Bombus terrestris. Three models have been used to assess population growth (matrix model), spread speed (integrodifference equation), and equilibrium occupancy (lattice model) for C. scoparius. We use available demographic data for an Australian population to parameterize two of these models. Increased seed set due to more efficient pollination resulted in a higher population growth rate in the density-independent matrix model, whereas simulations of enhanced pollination scenarios had a negligible effect on equilibrium weed occupancy in the lattice model. This is attributed to strong microsite limitation of recruitment in invasive C. scoparius populations observed in Australia and incorporated in the lattice model. A lack of information regarding secondary ant dispersal of C. scoparius prevents us from parameterizing the integrodifference equation model for Australia, but studies of invasive populations in California suggest that spread speed will also increase with higher seed set. For microsite-limited C. scoparius populations, increased seed set has minimal effects on equilibrium site occupancy. However, for density-independent rapidly invading populations, increased seed set is likely to lead to higher growth rates and spread speeds. The impacts of introduced pollinators on native flora and fauna and the potential for promoting range expansion in pollinator-limited 'sleeper weeds' also remain substantial risks.																		1366-9516	1472-4642		WOS:000239798200014

Only bumblebees (and one Vespula) contacted the flower stigma whilst foraging and are probably the main pollinators. One-third of insect visits resulted in stigma contact and visitation rates were high. This explains the high seed set reported elsewhere. There were significant differences according to the body size of visitors, with large queen bees contacting stigmas more often than smaller workers. There were no significant differences in behaviour of three species (Bombus jonellus, B. lucorum and B. monticola) and all bees tended to move short distances between flowers on a single plant. Longer flights and movements among plants were rare. Pollen carryover was estimated to be high: there was no decline in the amount of pollen deposited on stigmas from the first to fifth flower visited. The impact of bee behaviour on reproduction and invasion by exotic R. ponticum is discussed.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000245406900009

However, if plants are adequately served by generalist pollinators, successful reproduction, naturalisation and expansion into exotic habitats may occur. Rhododendron ponticum is very successful, ecologically damaging invasive plant in Britain and Ireland, but is in decline in its native Iberian habitat. It spreads locally by sending out lateral branches, but for longer distance dispersal it relies on sexually produced seeds. Little is known about R. ponticum's pollination ecology and breeding biology in invaded habitats. We examined the flower-visiting communities and maternal reproductive success of R. ponticum in native populations in southern Spain and in exotic ones in Ireland. R. ponticum in flowers are visited by various generalist (polylectic) pollinator species in both native and exotic habitats. Although different species visited flowers in Ireland and Spain, the flower visitation rate was not significantly different. Insects foraging on R. ponticum in Spain carried less R. ponticum pollen than their Irish counterparts, and carried fewer pollen types. Fruit production per inflorescence varied greatly within all populations but was significantly correlated with visitation at the population level. Nectar was significantly depleted by insects in some exotic populations, suggesting that this invasive species is providing a floral resource for native insects in some parts of Ireland. The generality of the pollination system may be factor contributing to R.ponticum's success in exotic habitats.																		0960-3115	1572-9710		WOS:000235489200011

Some species are limited by a lack of suitable pollinators, but the introduction of exotic pollinators can facilitate rapid spread. In Tasmania, where many non-native plants are naturalised, exotic honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) have become established. We determined how these species affect the pollination of Lupinus arboreus, an invasive, nitrogen-fixing shrub, which is rarely visited by native pollinators. The proportion of flowers setting seed and the number of ovules fertilised per flower were positively related to the visitation rates of both exotic bee species. There was no effect of bee visitation rates on the proportion of seeds aborted prior to maturity, possibly due to postfertilisation environmental constraints. We conclude that the spread of B. terrestris may not alter the fecundity of L. arboreus because of the pollination service provided by A. mellifera, and discuss potential interactions between these two bee species.

Two classes of colonies were studied: founders, and established colonies. Nests and contents were collected from an experimental site and three control sites following several months of exposure at the experimental site to the apiary honey bee population. Nest contents were analysed for differences among sites in colony population parameters which could have been caused by resource competition with introduced honey bees. Colony founding and overall colony survival were also considered.During the first season, the average number of large larvae plus prepupae per colony was significantly higher in the experimental site than in the control site. This difference could, however, have been the result of a two-week gap in sampling all the sites. All nest parameters showed high variability and there were no other significant differences between the two kinds of site.In the experimental site during the second season there were, relative to the control sites, significantly fewer total numbers of adult males and females in established nests and in all nests combined, significantly more immatures of all stages in founder nests and significantly lower adult male:female ratio. Although preliminary in nature, the data suggest that, in the experimental plots, E. asimillima showed: (i) increased adult emigration, (ii) increased brood rearing success, and/or (iii) relatively later colony founding, compared to the three controls. The possibility of resource competition with honey bees causing the observed changes is discussed, along with alternative explanations.																		0307-692X			WOS:A1991GA22800004

Overall, as many total species of bees visited the flowers of the three invasive plant species as visited the seven natives. On average, invasive species were visited by twice as many bee species as were natives. With a single exception, visitors of invasives were generalist bees, rather than specialists. Colletes petalostemonis, the only native legume specialist recorded, was an abundant forager on the flowers of both species of Melilotus, demonstrating that at least some specialist bees will move to invasive plants that are closely related to their usual hosts. Species abundant on the flowers of invasives tended to collect both pollen and nectar, suggesting that bees are using pollen of Tamarix and Melilotus to provision their offspring. We argue that invasives with entomophilous flowers are unlikely to either facilitate the reproduction of uncommon native plants or consistently compete with them for pollinators. Rather, they are likely, over time, to selectively increase the carrying capacity and population size of native bees, specifically generalists, and specialists of closely related plant species.																		0885-8608	2162-4399		WOS:000252460500006

BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				16	11			3083	3094		10.1007/s10531-007-9164-8				OCT 2007	2007	Capitol Reef National Park in central Utah, USA surrounds 22 managed fruit orchards started over a century ago by Mormon pioneers. Honey bees are imported for pollination, although the area in which the Park is embedded has over 700 species of native bees, many of which are potential orchard pollinators. We studied the visitation of native bees to apple, pear, apricot, and sweet cherry over 2 years. Thirty species of bees visited the flowers but, except for pear flowers, most were uncommon compared to honey bees. Evidence that honey bees prevented native bees from foraging on orchard crop flowers was equivocal: generally, honey bee and native bee visitation rates to the flowers were not negatively correlated, nor were native bee visitation rates positively correlated with distance of orchards from honey bee hives. Conversely, competition was tentatively suggested by much larger numbers of honey bees than natives on the flowers of apples, apricots and cherry; and by the large increase of native bees on pears, where honey bee numbers were low. At least one-third of the native bee species visiting the flowers are potential pollinators, including cavity-nesting species such as Osmia lignaria propinqua, currently managed for small orchard pollination in the US, plus several fossorial species, including one rosaceous flower specialist (Andrena milwaukiensis). We suggest that gradual withdrawal of honey bees from the Park would help conserve native bee populations without decreasing orchard crop productivity, and would serve as a demonstration of the commercial value of native pollinators.																		0960-3115	1572-9710		WOS:000248910700005

Detecting the effects of introduced species: a case study of competition between Apis and Bombus								OIKOS				114	3			407	418		10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.14604.x				SEP 2006	2006	Developing tools for rapid assessment of introduced species impacts is one of the most important challenges in invasion ecology. Most assessments of impact rely on correlational data or other indirect measures. Yet few studies have evaluated invasion effects using multiple, simultaneously applied monitoring and experimental approaches, in order to compare easily obtained metrics with more difficult but direct measures of reproductive success or population dynamics. In this study, I use data from an experimental test of introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera) impacts on native bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to address two major questions: 1) how well did observational data on niche overlap and spatial correlations between Apis and Bombus predict the results of experimental tests of competitive effects? and 2) how well did effects of the experimental Apis manipulations on Bombus foragers, which are easy to observe, predict changes in reproductive success of colonies, which are difficult to measure? Niche overlap between Apis and Bombus varied substantially, but increased to levels as high as 80-90% during periods of resource scarcity. Correlations between numbers of Apis foragers and numbers of Bombus foragers were also highly variable, but I detected a significant negative relationship in only one of the seven months observed. In contrast, the experimental results showed that mean numbers of Bombus foragers observed on a given transect increased significantly with greater distance from introduced Apis colonies. Of these three measures (niche overlap, correlations in abundances, and effects of experimental introductions), only the experimental data on forager abundances accurately estimated competitive effects on colony reproductive success previously reported for the same experiment, and the correlational data in particular completely failed to predict the effects observed in the experimental study. This work suggests that great caution is warranted in making assessments of invasion impact on the basis of spatial or temporal correlations between invasive and native species. Thus, investing in even small and limited experimental studies may be more valuable than extensive observational work in quantifying invasion impacts.																		0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000239988300003

However, although exotics can have potentially great ecological and evolutionary consequences, very few researchers have studied the effect of exotics on the interactions between plants and their mutualistic partners, such as pollinators, and none have reported on such impacts in logged and undisturbed boreal forest ecosystems. Here we show how experimental introductions of an exotic plant species (Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham) affect pollinator visitation and female reproductive success of a native plant (Melampyrum pratense L.) in recently disturbed (i.e., logged) and in undisturbed boreal forest habitats. The presence of Phacelia significantly increased the number of bumble bees entering plots in both habitat types. However, the exotic species had a strong negative impact on the visitation rate to the native species in both habitat types. Despite this negative impact on pollinator visitation, the exotic had no effect on female reproductive success of the native species in any habitat. Our results show that seed production may be more robust than pollinator visitation to exotic invasion, irrespective of habitat disturbance history.																		0002-9122	1537-2197		WOS:000237941600008	21642149

Specifically, disruptions to pollination and seed-dispersal mutualistic interactions are often documented, although the profound implications of such impacts are not widely recognized. Such disruptions can occur via the introduction of alien pollinators, seed dispersers, herbivores, predators or plants, and we define here the many potential outcomes of each situation. The frequency and circumstances under which each category of mechanisms operates are also poorly known. Most evidence is from population-level studies, and the implications for global biodiversity are difficult to predict. Further insights are needed on the degree of resilience in interaction networks, but the preliminary picture suggests that invasive species frequently cause profound disruptions to plant reproductive mutualisms.																		0169-5347	1872-8383		WOS:000237144500009	16701087

Agriculture can contribute to the conservation of high-diversity systems, which may provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control via complementarity and sampling effects. Land-use management is often focused on few species and local processes, but in dynamic, agricultural landscapes, only a diversity of insurance species may guarantee resilience (the capacity to reorganize after disturbance). Interacting species experience their surrounding landscape at different spatial scales, which influences trophic interactions. Structurally complex landscapes enhance local diversity in agroecosystems, which may compensate for local high-intensity management. Organisms with high-dispersal abilities appear to drive these biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services, because of their recolonization ability and larger resources experienced. Agri-environment schemes (incentives for farmers to benefit the environment) need to broaden their perspective and to take the different responses to schemes in simple (high impact) and complex (low impact) agricultural landscapes into account. In simple landscapes, local allocation of habitat is more important than in complex landscapes, which are in total at risk. However, little knowledge of the relative importance of local and landscape management for biodiversity and its relation to ecosystem services make reliable recommendations difficult.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000230335900009

Recent studies have suggested that asymmetric specialization in species interactions could be more common than previously thought. We contrasted patterns of asymmetric specialization observed in 18 plant-pollinator interaction webs with predictions based on null models. We found that asymmetric specialization is common in plant-pollinator interactions, and that its occurrence is more frequent than expected under a simple null model that assumed random interactions among species; furthermore, large assemblages with many pairs of,interacting species tend to have more asymmetric interactions than smaller assemblages. A second null model, which incorporated a correlation between species frequency of interaction and degree of specialization observed in most data sets produced patterns that were generally closer to those present in the data. At least three kinds of explanations could account for the observed asymmetric specialization, including random interactions among individuals (rather than species), adaptive consequences of specialization, and artifacts, such as data aggregation and sampling biases. Future studies should be aimed at understanding the relative importance of each of these alternative explanations in generating asymmetric specialization in species interactions.																		0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:000221433300008

Five species of bumblebees are currently used for crop pollination, the major ones being Bombus terrestris from Eurasia and Bombus impatiens from North America. As a result of their frequent use in foreign territories, there have been reports of B. terrestris becoming established, as well as interactions and/or competition with local (bumble-) bee fauna. Of the many vegetable, fruit and seed crops that bumblebees pollinate, greenhouse tomatoes are of predominant importance. In 2004, 40 000 ha of tomato crops were pollinated, with a crop value of e 12 000 million. The growers benefit from bumblebee pollination because of lower production costs, increased yields, and improved fruit quality. The interrelationship between commercial mechanisms and ecological risks is discussed.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000238973900002

We reviewed published pair-wise experiments between invading and native plant species. Although the designs that have been used allow only limited inferences, the available data suggest that the effect of invasive species on native species is usually stronger than vice versa. Furthermore, mixtures of invasive and native species are generally less productive than monocultures of the native species, but not less than monocultures of the invasive species. However, the selection of invaders and natives for study has not been random, and the data could be biased towards highly competitive invaders and natives that are weaker than average competitors. We attempt to clarify confusion surrounding the concept of competitive superiority in the context of plant invasions, and we discuss the limitations of the methods that have been used to investigate competition between invasive and native species. To rigorously test the generality of the hypothesis that invaders are better competitors than natives we need to compare the effects of closely related native and invasive species on each other. We suggest that the influence of an invading species on total plant community biomass is an important clue in understanding the role of competition in a plant invasion. The role of competition in the establishment and naturalization stages of the invasion process may be very different from its role in the "outbreak" stage.																		0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000220383100003

We analysed the response of bumblebees at genus and species level to experimentally increased honeybee density. The study was carried out on a Phacelia tanacetifolia field and adjacent patches of wild plants located in an agricultural landscape. Addition of one or ten A. m. ligustica colonies substantially increased total honeybee density not only on Phacelia but also on neighbouring patches of wild plants. The response of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) differed among species. Only minor spatial changes in the abundance of the short-tongued B. terrestris-group were observed on Phacelia. At wild plant patches, the B. lapidarius-group and the longer tongued bumblebee species (B. muscorum, B. sylvarum, B. pascuorum) responded with a shift between plant species. Limitations of competition avoidance in flower-impoverished landscapes are discussed.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000242177000002

This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant-pollinator coevolution and in the long-standing concept of ''pollination syndromes.'' But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest, To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera, We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in ''phenotype space,'' there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior acid morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the ''correct'' pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information-processing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with a net loss of diversity.																		0012-9658	1939-9170		WOS:A1996UN89400009

In contrast, we show that densities of bumblebees, an important pollinator group in agroecosystems, were not determined by the proportion of semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes. Instead, bumblebee densities were positively related to the availability of highly rewarding mass flowering crops (i.e. oilseed rape) in the landscape. In addition, mass flowering crops were only effective determinants of bumblebee densities when grown extensively at the landscape scale, but not at smaller local scales. Therefore, future conservation measures should consider the importance of mass flowering crops and the need for management schemes at landscape level to sustain vital pollination services in agroecosystems.																		1461-023X			WOS:000186323600001

However, local resource partitioning does not fully explain the species diversity of bumblebee communities. Theoretical studies provide new evidence that partitioning of space can promote species coexistence, when species interact with their environment at different spatial scales. If bumblebee species possess specific foraging ranges, different spatial resource utilisation patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in bumblebee communities. We investigated the effects of the landscape-wide availability of different resources (mass flowering crops and semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250-3,000 m radius) to indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced in landscapes with high proportions of mass flowering crops (mainly oilseed rape). We found the strongest effects for Bombus terrestris agg. and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus pascuorum were most strongly influenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000 m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal significance) at a small spatial scale (250 m). The estimated foraging ranges tended to be related to body and colony sizes, indicating that larger species travel over larger distances than smaller species, presumably enabling them to build up larger colonies through a better exploitation of food resources. We conclude that coexistence in bumblebee communities could potentially be mediated by species-specific differences in the spatial resource utilisation patterns, which should be considered in conservation schemes.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000239735300011	16758219

These complex interactions are often overlooked in studies of interactions between alien and native species, and their role in influencing biological invasions has been rarely considered. Based on a comprehensive review of the invasion biology literature, we examine the evidence for the occurrence of four of the most commonly documented indirect effects (apparent competition, indirect mutualism/commensalism, exploitative competition, and trophic cascades) in the invasion process. Studies investigating indirect effects in the context of invasion biology are relatively rare, but have been increasing in recent years, and there are sufficient examples to indicate that this kind of interaction is likely to be more common than is currently recognized. Whether indirect interactions are mediated by an alien or a native species, and whether they occur between ecologically similar or dissimilar alien and native species, depends in part on the type of interaction considered and no predictable patterns were detected in the literature. Further empirical studies will help to elucidate such patterns. At this stage, the inherent unpredictability of indirect interactions means that their impacts in relation to invasions are particularly challenging for land managers to deal with, and their role in invasions is a complex, but is a valuable area of investigation for researchers.																		1366-9516	1472-4642		WOS:000238744700013

We find that there is evidence that some bumblebee species are declining in Europe, North America, and Asia. People believe that land-use changes may be having a negative effect through reductions in food plants in many parts of the world, but that other factors such as pathogens may be having a stronger effect for a few species in some regions (especially for Bombus s. str. in North America). Evidence so far is that greater susceptibility to land-use change is associated world-wide with small climatic ranges, range edges, and late-starting colony-development cycles. More evidence is needed on the roles of pollen specialization, nest sites, hibernation sites, and pesticides. It is still too early to assess the success of schemes aimed at improving forage in agricultural and conservation areas. However, schemes aimed at raising public awareness have been very successful. Until proven safe, we recommend that live bumblebees should not be moved across continents or oceans for commercial pollination.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000267832600012

We used crop pollination as a model system, and investigated whether the loss of a domesticated pollinator (the honey bee) could be compensated for by native, wild bee species. We measured pollination provided to watermelon crops at 23 farms in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA, and used a simulation model to separate the pollen provided by honey bees and native bees. Simulation results predict that native bees alone provide sufficient pollination at > 90% of the farms studied. Furthermore, empirical total pollen deposition at flowers was strongly, significantly correlated with native bee visitation but not with honey bee visitation. The honey bee is currently undergoing extensive die-offs because of Colony Collapse Disorder. We predict that in our region native bees will buffer potential declines in agricultural production because of honey bee losses.																		1461-023X			WOS:000249882700010	17877737

The distribution area of the Chinese honeybees has reduced by over 75%, and population number reduced over 80% under the competition by the western honeybees. The decrease of the Chinese honeybees results in the reduction of plant total pollination and plant diversity.
