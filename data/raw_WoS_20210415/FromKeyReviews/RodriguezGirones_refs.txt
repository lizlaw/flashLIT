A correlation between the dry weight of a provision and the number of pollen grains in the provision was established. Male and female provisions contain a mean of 4 634 304 and 8 046 425 almond pollen grains, respectively. A correlation between the dry weight of a provision and the number of foraging trips was also established. The mean number of foraging trips necessary to complete a provision was 16.76 for male provisions and 26.79 for female provisions. During an almond blooming period, each O cornuta female potentially visits from 9 500 to 23 600 almond flowers. Given the pollinating efficiency of O cornuta on almond, 3 females per tree are considered sufficient to maximize pollination in an almond orchard.																		0044-8435			WOS:A1994MW99200009

The objective of this 3-year study was to analyze the relationship between nesting female body size, provisioning rate and longevity and their effect on several traits related to parental investment and reproductive success in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta. Body size was not correlated to longevity, and it was only correlated to provisioning rate in the third year (with poor weather conditions during nesting). Variation in fecundity, offspring size and offspring mortality was not well explained by nesting female body size in any of the 3 years. However, in the third year, small females biased their investment toward males, the sex requiring smaller pollen-nectar provisions. Large females were more successful usurpers of other females' nests, but fecundity of usurpers was no higher than fecundity of nonusurpers. Large females were more likely to establish at the release site, probably in relation to size-dependent vigor at emergence. A review of the literature on parental investment in solitary aculeate Hymenoptera showed a stronger relationship between body size and reproductive success in wasps than in bees. In O. cornuta, fecundity was strongly related to longevity and provisioning rate in all 3 years. Offspring size was associated with provisioning rate in 1 year, when females with higher provisioning rates tended to produce larger sons and daughters. Both longevity and provisioning rate appeared to be strongly conditioned by stochastic events.																		0340-5443			WOS:000236967400004

BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY				59	1			124	132		10.1007/s00265-005-0017-8				NOV 2005	2005	Fisher's theory of sex allocation predicts that, in a panmictic population, parental investment will be equally distributed between male and female progeny. Most studies on parental investment in nesting solitary bees and wasps use offspring or provision weight as estimators of parental investment and do not corroborate Fisher's theory. The measurement of parental investment may be confounded by several factors. First, the use of offspring or provision size does not account for seasonal variation in foraging costs associated with aging of nesting females. Second, provision or offspring size do not reflect parental investment associated with nest construction. In this two-year study we measured parental investment in a solitary bee. We calculated sex allocation using both provision weight and foraging time as parental investment estimators. Investment in pollen-nectar provisions decreased, while investment in mud structures (nest construction) increased, as the nesting period progressed. Overall investment in provisions per nest was similar to 25 times higher than investment in mud. Pollen-nectar foraging trips became longer as the season progressed, but mud trip duration did not vary. Due to weather differences between years, more offspring per female were produced in the first year, but progeny sex ratio and mean offspring size of both sexes were similar between years. Mortality did not differ between sexes. As predicted by Fisher's theory, production cost ratios did not differ from 1 in either year, irrespective of the currency used to estimate parental investment (provision weight or foraging time). Our results strongly support Fisher's theory.																		0340-5443	1432-0762		WOS:000233242600017

Body weight is often used as an estimator of production costs in aculeate Hymenoptera; however, due to differences between sexes in metabolic rates and water content, conversion of provision weight to body weight may differ between males and females. As a result, the cost of producing female progeny may often have been overestimated.2. Provision weight and body weight loss throughout development were measured in a solitary bee, Osmia cornuta (Latreille), to detect potential differences between sexes in food weight/body weight conversion.3. Male O. cornuta invest a larger proportion of larval weight in cocoon spinning, and presumably have higher metabolic rates than females during the larval period; however, this is compensated by a slightly longer larval period in females.4. Overall, body weight loss throughout the life cycle does not differ significantly between sexes. As a result, cost production ratios calculated from provision weights and from adult body weights are almost identical.5. The validity of other weight (cocoon, faeces) and linear (head width, intertegular span, wing length, cocoon length, and cell length) measures as estimators of production costs is also discussed.6. Valid estimators of production costs vary across species due to differences in sex weight ratio, cocoon shape, provision size in reference to cell size, and adult body size.																		0307-6946			WOS:000175126300001

Similar variation of wingbeat frequency in hovering flight occurred among small to large species, and ranged from 250 to 86 Hz.

However, such adaptations do not prevent the transfer of pollen between flowers on the same plant (geitonogamy). Recent empirical studies, aided by advances in field techniques, statistical methods and modelling, show that geitonogamy often is substantial and increases with plant size. Selfing by geitonogamy incurs a fitness cost of reduced pollen export, and recent reports show that seed set can suffer as well, even in self-incompatible species. Geitonogamy has important implications for sex-allocation theory, the evolution of dioecy and other issues in evolutionary biology.																		0169-5347			WOS:A1993LT68100007	21236182

The number of nectar foraging bumblebees on plants varying in size (Viscaria vulgaris) was proportional to the number of open flowers per plant, and on plants varying in rate of nectar production per flower (Anchusa officinalis) proportional to the nectar production per plant. These distributions results in a nectar gain per flower which is independent of plant size and rate of nectar production per flower.A computer simulation showed that the distribution of the bees and the equalization of the gain per flower can partly be explained by the bees' systematic searching for nectar, and partly by a non-random plant choice. The bees search systematically by using an optimal rejection threshold gain to avoid recently depleted flowers. The non-random plant choices consist in preferences for large plants and high nectar producers.At stands varying in plant density (Viscaria vulgaris), bee and flower densities were proportional, which also results in a constant gain per flower. This distribution is explained by a preference for foraging on dense stands and maybe by a systematic searching among the plants.																		0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:A1995QN42500001

However, other selective agents, including predators, seed feeders, and herbivores, may affect pollination systems. Because flowers are predictable food sources for a variety of species, flowers are also reliable sites at which predators can locate flower-visiting animals. Prominent among pollinators' predators are beewolves (Philanthus spp.), common sphecid wasps (Sphecidae) that prey almost exclusively on bees. My fieldwork over three years indicates first, that an area of similar to 50 km(2) surrounding a single bumble bee wolf (Philanthus bicinctus) aggregation had a low bumble bee (Bombus spp.) density caused by intense predation by the wasps, and second, that fruit-set of the bumble bee-pollinated western monkshood (Aconitum. columbianum) was significantly lower at locations and times of bumble bee wolf activity than at control locations and times with no such predatory activity. These results indicate that predation can sometimes alter plant-pollinator interactions.																		0012-9658			WOS:000229723700004

In three experiments, it was found that honeybees showed sensitivity to perceived danger at flowers by preferring apparently safe flowers over equally rewarding alternatives harbouring either a dead bee or a spider, and avoiding revisitation of a site where the bees had escaped a simulated predation attempt. These results suggest that bees, like other animals, take antipredatory measures, which may have far reaching effects on animal-flower interactions.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000170417800008

We tested this prediction in a field experiment with 10 matched pairs of milkweed patches in which one patch in each pair contained crab spiders and the other patch was predator free. Significantly fewer honeybees were observed in the spider than no spider patches, but there was no spider effect on the two species of bumblebees. A possible explanation for this difference is that the honeybees suffered three times higher predation rates than the bumblebees. There were no spider effects on either the rate of pollinia removal from milkweed flowers or the number and mass of seeds produced. The results suggest that crab spiders may have only small effects on bees and plant fitness, at least where bees are abundant.																		1195-6860	2376-7626		WOS:000230239500011

Two other bumblebee species, B. terricola and B. vagans, did not avoid the spider patches. The latter two species are larger than B. ternarius and honeybees and suffer lower crab-spider predation. As far as we know, this is the first field study documenting negative effects of predators on flower visitation rate by pollinator populations. Our study suggests that pollinator response to predation may influence pollinator-plant interactions.																		0030-1299	1600-0706		WOS:000182106600016

In this study we manipulated artificial crab spiders on flowers of Rubus rosifolius to test the effects of predation risk on flower-visiting insects and strength of trait-mediated indirect effects to plant fitness. In addition, we tested which predator traits (e. g., forelimbs, abdomen) are recognized and avoided by pollinators. Total visitation rate was higher for control flowers than for flowers with an artificial crab spider. In addition, flowers with a sphere (simulating a spider abdomen) were more frequently visited than those with forelimbs or the entire spider model. Furthermore, the presence of artificial spiders decreased individual seed set by 42% and fruit biomass by 50%. Our findings indicate that pollinators, mostly bees, recognize and avoid flowers with predation risk; forelimbs seem to be the predator trait recognized and avoided by hymenopterans. Additionally, predator avoidance by pollinators resulted in pollen limitation, thereby affecting some components of plant fitness (fruit biomass and seed number). Because most pollinator species that recognized predation risk visited many other plant species, trait-mediated indirect effects of spiders cascading down to plant fitness may be a common phenomenon in the Atlantic rainforest ecosystem.																		0012-9658			WOS:000259259300006	18831161

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR				64				123	130		10.1006/anbe.2002.3041				JUL 2002	2002	Bumblebee workers vary greatly in size, unlike workers of most other social bees. This variability has not been adequately explained. In many social insects, size variation is adaptive, with different-sized workers performing different tasks (alloethism). Here we established whether workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera; Apidae), exhibit alloethism. We quantified the size of workers engaging in foraging compared to those that remain in the nest, and confirmed that it is the larger bees that tend to forage ((X) over bar +/- SE thorax widths 4.34 +/- 0.01 mm for nest bees and 4.93 +/- 0.02 mm for foragers). We then investigated whether large bees are better suited to foraging because they. are able to transport heavier loads of food back to the nest. Both pollen and nectar loads of returning foragers were measured, demonstrating that larger bees do return with a heavier mass of forage. Foraging trip times were inversely related to bee size when collecting nectar, but were unrelated to bee size for bees collecting pollen. Overall, large bees brought back more nectar per unit time than. small bees, but the rate of pollen collection appeared, to be unrelated to size. The smallest foragers had a nectar foraging rate close to zero, presumably explaining why foragers tend to be large. Why might larger bees be better at foraging? Various explanations are considered: larger bees are able to forage in, cooler conditions, may he able to forage over larger distances, and are perhaps also less vulnerable to predation. Conversely, small workers are presumably cheaper to produce and may be more nimble at within-nest tasks. Further research is needed to assess these,possibilities.

However, native bees avoided flowers occupied by spiders and landed on vacant flowers more frequently. In contrast to honeybees that did not coevolve with T. spectabilis, Australian native bees show an anti-predatory response to avoid flowers occupied by this predator.																		0962-8452			WOS:000221321100021	15252982

These indicate the operation of some kind of optimal response, but this cannot be based on energy because energy expenditure does not change as the wings get damaged. However, wingbeat frequency increases with wing damage. A deterministic analytical model was constructed, based on the assumptions that bees have a limited total number of wingbeats that the flight motor can perform and that they maximize lifetime energy profit by conserving the number of wingbeats used in foraging. The optimal response to wing damage is to reduce the threshold number of flowers needed to accept an inflorescence. The predicted optimal gradient between wing damage (wingbeat frequency) and acceptance threshold (number of flowers on an inflorescence) was close to the observed gradient from field data. This model demonstrates that wear and tear is a significant factor in optimal foraging strategies.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000226419100010	15615686	
J	Higginson, Andrew D.; Ruxton, Graeme D.; Skelhorn, John								The impact of flower-dwelling predators on host plant reproductive success								OECOLOGIA				164	2			411	421		10.1007/s00442-010-1681-6				OCT 2010	2010	Flowers attract insects and so are commonly exploited as foraging sites by sit-and-wait predators. Such predators can be costly to their host plant by consuming pollinators. However, sit-and-wait predators are often prey generalists that also consume plant antagonists such as herbivores, nectar robbers and granivores, so may also provide benefits to their host plant. Here we present a simple, but general, model that provides novel predictions about how costs and benefits interact in different ecological circumstances. The model predicts that the ecological conditions in which flower-dwelling predators are found can generate either net benefits to their host plants, net costs to their host plants, or can have no effect on the fitness of their host plants. The net effect is influenced by the relative densities of mutualists and antagonists. The flower-dwelling predator has a strong positive effect on the plant if both the pollinators and the granivores are at high density. Further, the range of density combinations that yield a positive net outcome for the plant increases if the performance of pollinators is negatively density dependent, if the predator is only moderately effective at influencing flower visitor rates by its potential prey, and if pollinators are very effective. If plants of a given species find themselves consistently in conditions where they benefit from the presence of a predator then we predict that natural selection could favour the evolution of plant traits that increase the likelihood of predator recruitment and retention, especially where plants are served by highly effective pollinators.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000281860700013	20563603

Specifically, is predator-avoidance learning and memory retention disrupted by cryptic coloration of predators, such as crab spiders [4, 5]? How does experience with different predators affect foraging decisions? We evaluated these questions by exposing foraging bumblebees to controlled predation risk from predators (robotic crab spiders) that were either cryptic or highly contrasting, as assessed by a quantitative model of bee color perception [6]. Our results from 3D tracking software reveal a speed-accuracy tradeoff [7]: Bees slow their inspection flights after learning that there is a risk from cryptic spiders. The adjustment of inspection effort results in accurate predator detection, leveling out predation risk at the expense of foraging time. Overnight-retention tests reveal no decline in performance, but bees that had experienced cryptic predators are more prone to "false alarms" (rejection of foraging opportunities on safe flowers) than those that had experienced conspicuous predators. Therefore, bees in the cryptic-spider treatment made a functional decision to trade off reduced foraging efficiency via increased inspection times and false-alarm rates against higher potential fitness loss from being injured or eaten.																		0960-9822			WOS:000260137900030	18771920

However, a better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying behaviourally mediated indirect effects of predators is necessary to properly understand their role in community dynamics. We used the tripartite relationship between bumblebees, predatory crab spiders and flowers to ask whether behaviourally mediated effects are localized to flowers harbouring predators, or whether bees extend their avoidance to entire plant species. In a tightly controlled laboratory environment, bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were exposed to a random mixture of equally rewarding yellow and white artificial flowers, but foraging on yellow flowers was very risky: bees had a 25 per cent chance of receiving a simulated predation attempt by 'robotic' crab spiders. As bees learnt to avoid 'dangerous' flowers, their foraging preferences changed and they began to visit fewer yellow flowers than expected by chance. Bees avoided spider-free yellow flowers as well as dangerous yellow flowers when spiders were more difficult to detect (the colour of yellow spiders was indistinguishable from that of yellow flowers). Therefore, this interaction between bee learning and predator crypsis could lead flower species harbouring cryptic predators to suffer from reduced reproductive success.																		0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000265450700014	19324797

Jones, Emily/B-7895-2010	Jones, Emily/0000-0002-0605-884X			Optimal foraging when predation risk increases with patch resources: an analysis of pollinators and ambush predators								OIKOS				119	5			835	840		10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17841.x				MAY 2010	2010	Pollinators and their predators share innate and learned preferences for high quality flowers. Consequently, pollinators are more likely to encounter predators when visiting the most rewarding flowers. I present a model of how different pollinator species can maximize lifetime resource gains depending on the density and distribution of predators, as well as their vulnerability to capture by predators. For pollinator species that are difficult for predators to capture, the optimal strategy is to visit the most rewarding flowers as long as predator density is low. At higher predator densities and for pollinators that are more vulnerable to predator capture, the lifetime resource gain from the most rewarding flowers declines and the optimal strategy depends on the predator distribution. In some cases, a wide range of floral rewards provides near-maximum lifetime resource gains, which may favor generalization if searching for flowers is costly. In other cases, a low flower reward level provides the maximum lifetime resource gain and so pollinators should specialize on less rewarding flowers. Thus, the model suggests that predators can have qualitatively different top-down effects on plant reproductive success depending on the pollinator species, the density of predators, and the distribution of predators across flower reward levels.																		0030-1299			WOS:000276936000011		
J	Knerer, Gerd								The biology and social behaviour of Evylaeus malachurus (K.) (Hymenoptera; Halictidae) in different climatic regions of Europe								Zoologische Jahrbuecher Abteilung fuer Systematik Oekologie und Geographie der Tiere				119	2			261	290						1992	1992	The eusocial halictine bee Evylaeus malachurus is common over most of southern and central Europe. Overwintered gynes establish haplometrotic nests in spring. A single brood of workers is produced in the northern region, two broods are common in central Europe and southern Spain, up to three broods occur in some parts of the mediterranean area. Nests in the first phase contain from three to twelve cells, arranged in a comb and surrounded by a cavity. Nests of later phases are deeper with increasing numbers of cells. The latter are either clustered or scattered along the burrows. Brood cells are open during larval feeding, the faeces are removed by the workers before the cells are capped with an earthen plug. The caste system is based on conspicuous morphometric and physiological differences. Gynes are reared on big pollen balls, have substantial abdominal fat bodies and require a diapause before nest foundation in spring. Queens lay virtually all diploid eggs for worker and gyne production. Workers are raised on small provisions, lack fat bodies and a diapause, but commence activities immediately after emergence. Their main tasks include foraging, defence and construction, although some become egg-layers under certain circumstances. Males account for only 2% of the first brood, but their numbers increase throughout the summer, thanks to ovipositing workers in orphaned and very large nests. Populations of the nests in the last phase can range from a handful to close to ninety bees. Productivity is commensurate, extending from a low of half a dozen gynes to more than several hundred sexuals. Fecundity of this magnitude explains the colonising efficacy of the species, both with regards to newly created nest sites and old aggregations recently devastated by the depredations of brood parasites.																		0044-5193			BCI:BCI199395039927		
J	KUKUK, PF; MAY, B								COLONY DYNAMICS IN A PRIMITIVELY EUSOCIAL HALICTINE BEE LASIOGLOSSUM (DIALICTUS) ZEPHYRUM (HYMENOPTERA, HALICTIDAE)								INSECTES SOCIAUX				38	2			171	189		10.1007/BF01240967				1991	1991	Proximate control of colony dynamics was studied in the primitively eusocial halictine bee Lasioglossum (Dialictus) zephyrum using allozyme markers. The results indicate that workers produce on average 15 % of the male brood (range = 0-50 %) in small laboratory colonies made up of unrelated, single-generation, uninseminated females. This proportion is not influenced by colony size, but is influenced by the relative size of the queen. Large queens are more successful in dominating their workers than are small queens, the queen being defined as the female that is the mother of most of the brood produced in the colony. Older and larger females tend to become queens. Thus, while small differences in age (up to 4 days) influence which female becomes a queen, her ability to control her workers is primarily influenced by her relative size. The proportion of reproduction that is co-opted by the queen is negatively correlated with colony reproductivity (the number of males/day/female). Colony reproductivity is also negatively correlated with the standard deviation in size among females.																		0020-1812	1420-9098		WOS:A1991GB16000009		
J	Muller, A; Diener, S; Schnyder, S; Stutz, K; Sedivy, C; Dorn, S					Diener, Stefan/0000-0002-6622-6980			Quantitative pollen requirements of solitary bees: Implications for bee conservation and the evolution of bee-flower relationships								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				130	4			604	615		10.1016/j.biocon.2006.01.023				JUL 2006	2006	Knowledge about the quantitative pollen requirements of solitary bees is crucial for the preservation of endangered bee species and the understanding of the evolution of bee-flower relationships. We estimate the number of flowers required to rear a single larva for 41 European bee species (i) by comparing the pollen content of brood cells with the pollen quantity contained in the flowers of the bees' host plants and (ii) by deducing the pollen requirements from a regression model describing the relationship between the average bee dry body mass and the average brood cell pollen content. The flower requirements of the bee species examined vary by three orders of magnitude. Depending on both bee species and host plant, from seven to 1100 flowers or from 0.9 to 4.5 flower heads are needed to rear a single larva. As only about 40% of the pollen contained in a flower was found to be available to a single female bee, these minimal figures have to be multiplied by a factor of approximately 2.5 to obtain a realistic estimate of bee flower requirements The amount of pollen lost from flowers for bee nutrition is surprisingly high. We hypothesize that the recent decline of many bee species may have its main cause in a food shortage provoked by a decrease in flower diversity and quantity following habitat destruction and modern agricultural practices. The substantial pollen losses to bees as documented in this study support earlier findings on floral adaptations against excessive pollen harvesting by bees. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	MULLER, CB; SCHMIDHEMPEL, P								CORRELATES OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AMONG FIELD COLONIES OF BOMBUS-LUCORUM - THE IMPORTANCE OF GROWTH AND PARASITES								ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY				17	4			343	353		10.1111/j.1365-2311.1992.tb01068.x				NOV 1992	1992	(1) In natural populations, colonies of bumble bees vary in many important life history traits, such as colony size and age at maturity, or the number and sex of reproductives produced. We investigated how the presence of parasites in field populations of the bumble bee Bombus lucorum L. relates to variation in life history traits and reproductive performance. A total of thirty-six colonies was placed in accessible nest sites in the field and monitored at regular intervals throughout a season. (2) Among the life history correlates, early nest foundation was strongly associated with large maximum colony size, old age and large size at maturity, and this in turn with successful production of males and queens, as well as with the number of sexuals produced. Overall, reproductive success was highly skewed with only five colonies producing all the queens. Sixteen colonies failed to reproduce altogether. (3) The social parasite Psithyrus was abundant early in the Bombus colony cycle and preferentially invaded host nests with many first brood workers and thus disproportionately large size, i.e. those colonies that would otherwise be more likely to reproduce or produce (daughter) queens rather than males. To prevent nest loss, Psithyrus had to be removed soon after invasion. Therefore, the effects reported here can only be crude estimates. (4) Parasitoid conopid flies are likely to cause heavy worker mortality when sexuals are reared by the colonies. Their inferred effect was a reduction in biomass that could be invested in sexuals as well as a shift in the sex ratio at the population level resulting from failure to produce queens. We suggest to group the inferred correlates into 'early events' surrounding colony initiation and social parasitism, and 'late events' surrounding attained colony size in summer and parasitism by conopid flies. Our evidence thus provides a heuristic approach to understand the factors that affect reproductive success of Bombus colonies.																		0307-6946	1365-2311		WOS:A1992KE96200007

Amidst growing evidence that predators influence plant-pollinator interactions, I suggest that such pollinator-mediated indirect effects may be a common feature of terrestrial communities, with implications for research into top-down effects and pollination ecology. Experimental evidence of such an effect from a riparian system in northern California is provided, where crab spiders decreased seed production in inflorescences of the invasive plant Leucanthemum vulgare by reducing the frequency and duration of floral visits by pollinating insects.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000184689900003

Although large (major) males defeat smaller ones in competition for emerging females and therefore are more likely to mate, majors are greatly outnumbered by half-sized (minor) males. Nesting females might produce many minor males, despite their low reproductive value, because female behaviour is governed by a mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), in which case the ratio of majors to miners should not be affected by changes in female condition. In contrast, a conditional-strategy hypothesis predicts that older, wing-worn or stressed females unable to forage efficiently should be especially likely to produce minor offspring, which require less brood provisions. To test these alternative hypotheses, we manipulated the condition of nesting female bees by the addition of weights and the removal of their wing margins. These manipulations, done early in the flight season, failed to increase the production of minor males, a result consistent with the mixed-ESS hypothesis. However, unmanipulated females were far more likely to produce minor males if they were small or if they were nesting late in the season, when foraging conditions had deteriorated, findings that are consistent with a conditional provisioning strategy. Thus it appears that the abundance of minor males is the result of a conditional provisioning strategy of nesting females, which may be superimposed on a fixed tendency to produce large offspring early in the season and small ones later.																		0340-5443			WOS:000169536400010		
J	Verdolin, Jennifer L.								Meta-analysis of foraging and predation risk trade-offs in terrestrial systems								BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY				60	4			457	464		10.1007/s00265-006-0172-6				AUG 2006	2006	Although there is ample evidence for the generality of foraging and predation trade-offs in aquatic systems, its application to terrestrial systems is less comprehensive. In this review, meta-analysis was used to analyze experiments on giving-up-densities in terrestrial systems to evaluate the overall magnitude of predation risk on foraging behavior and experimental conditions mediating its effect. Results indicate a large and significant decrease in foraging effort as a consequence of increased predation risk. Whether experiments were conducted under natural or artificial conditions produced no change in the overall effect predation had on foraging. Odor and live predators as a correlate of predation risk had weaker and nonsignificant effects compared to habitat characteristics. The meta-analysis suggests that the effect of predation risk on foraging behavior in terrestrial systems is strongly dependent on the type of predation risk being utilized.																		0340-5443	1432-0762		WOS:000238847200001
