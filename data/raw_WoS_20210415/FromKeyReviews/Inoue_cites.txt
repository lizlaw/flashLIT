J	Buttermore, RE								Observations of successful Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies in southern Tasmania								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY				36				251	254		10.1111/j.1440-6055.1997.tb01463.x				AUG 29 1997	1997	Early attempts to acclimatise Bombus spp. to Australia were not successful but a pre-1992 introduction of the bumble bee B. terrestris has succeeded and the species is slowly spreading in southern Tasmania. It is likely that the genetic base of the Tasmanian population is limited if, as is thought, only a few queens were brought from New Zealand. This may affect the rate of dispersal through the island, which presently averages 12.5 km/year. In 1995-96 Is feral colonies found in and around Hobart were transferred to nest boxes, where colony development could be monitored. All of the colonies produced queens, and the ratio of queens to workers (1:4.71) compares favourably with the upper end of colony performance scale in New Zealand(1:5.19). At least two generations are produced during warmer months and there is no indication of genetic impediments to further dispersal in Tasmania or possibly even mainland Australia. External influences such as predatory habits of birds, availability of food, competition from other insects and deliberate introduction by people into new areas make the rate of spread unpredictable.																		1326-6756			WOS:A1997XY47600009

The establishment of species outside their natural geographical ranges is an important driver of changes in global biodiversity. This creates an imperative to understand why some species are more successful than others at establishing viable populations following introduction.2. Historical data are particularly useful in this regard, and those for birds especially comprehensive. This has resulted in the publication of regional-scale studies that have used these data to attempt to quantify relationships between establishment success and characteristics of bird introductions.3. We use a meta-analytical approach to summarize quantitatively the results of these studies, and to assess the influence of variables invoked to explain the variation in establishment success in birds.4. We find that variables describing characteristics specific to the individual introduction event (i.e. event-level variables), such as introduction effort (or 'propagule pressure'), are the most consistent predictors of establishment success.																		0021-8790	1365-2656		WOS:000227593600006

Unfortunately, however, propagule pressure is not recorded for most introductions. Studies must therefore either use proxies whose efficacy must be largely assumed, or ignore effort altogether. The results of such studies will be flawed if effort is not distributed at random with respect to other characteristics that are predicted to influence success. We use global data for more than 600 introduction events for birds to show that introduction effort is both the strongest correlate of introduction success, and correlated with a large number of variables previously thought to influence success. Apart from effort, only habitat generalism relates to establishment success in birds.																		0962-8452			WOS:000226100600007	15801588

Many are outstanding "ecological engineers", or providers of "ecosystem services", or potential bioindicator species. Few social insects are currently formally classified as Threatened, but this is almost certainly due to a lack of information on population sizes and trends in scarce species. The main influence that sociality has on threats faced by social insects is in reducing effective population sizes, increasing population genetic subdivision and possibly reducing levels of genetic variation relative to solitary species. The main influence that sociality has on threats from social insects is via its role in the ecological success of invasive species, which frequently pose a major hazard to native biotas. In some cases, social features underpinning ecological success in the original range almost certainly contribute to the success of invasive social insects. However, recent studies show or strongly suggest that, in some of the most notoriously invasive populations of ants, bees and wasps, novel social traits have arisen that greatly enhance the rate of spread and ecological competitiveness of these populations. Sociality can therefore represent either a liability or an asset in its contribution to the persistence of social insect populations.																		1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000172341500018

New Zealand Journal of Ecology				3				104	116						1980	1980	There are about 40 species of native bees in New Zealand, 36 of which belong to the Colletidae family, and the rest to the Halictidae. Introduced species include Apis mellifera, 4 Bombus species, and Nomia melanderi and Megachile rotundata. Honeybees in commercial apiaries, and other introduced species, forage mainly on introduced plants, but some honeybees do compete with native bees on native plants. The peak of foraging by native bees occurs at the season of the main honey flow, when there is most food. It is thought that competition for nest sites does not occur. It is concluded that the introduced species do not have a deleterious effect on native species; much more information on the latter is needed. P.

We also investigated mite infestation in commercial colonies of a Japanese native species, B. ignitus, which are mass-produced in the Netherlands and reimported into Japan. We detected the mite in both natural and commercial colonies of the Japanese species. Comparison of 555 bp sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I (CO1) gene from the mite showed that there were seven haplotypes, on the basis of combinations of substitutions at eight sites in the gene. The haplotypes of the mites in the Japanese native bumblebees and the haplotypes of the mites in B. terrestris did not overlap; however, mtDNA of mites detected in the commercial colonies of B. ignitus possessed the same sequence as a European haplotype. These results indicate that transportation of bumblebee colonies will cause overseas migration of parasitic mites of different origins.																		0962-1083			WOS:000170667500023	11555253	
J	Goka, Koichi								Influences of invasive species on native species: Will the European bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, bring genetic pollution into the Japanese native species?								Bulletin of the Biogeographical Society of Japan				53	2			91	101						Dec., 1998	1998	A bumble bee species, Bombus terrestris, has been introduced from Europe for pollination of tomato plants since 1991. Many ecologists have warned about biological invasion of the species. In 1996, a natural nest of the species was found in Hokkaido, indicating that it became naturalized. B. terrestris is such a competitive species that it would make strong ecological impact on Japanese native species through competition for food and nest site. Furthermore, B. terrestris has some potential for bringing genetic pollution into the populations of native species. Laboratory experiments showed that B. terrestris and a Japanese native species, B. hypocrita sapporoensis, could copulate and make hybrids. In this paper I discussed the possible ecological influences of B. terrestris on the Japanese native species, especially focusing on hybridization between them.																		0067-8716			BCI:BCI199900188419

As a result several bee species have been introduced to countries far beyond their home range, including A. mellifera, bumblebees (Bombus sp.), the alfalfa leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata, and various other solitary species. Possible negative consequences of these introductions include: competition with native pollinators for floral resources; competition for nest sites; co-introduction of natural enemies, particularly pathogens that may infect native organisms; pollination of exotic weeds; and disruption of pollination of native plants. For most exotic bee species little or nothing is known of these possible effects. Research to date has focused mainly on A. mellifera, and has largely been concerned with detecting competition with native flower visitors. Considerable circumstantial evidence has accrued that competition does occur, but no experiment has clearly demonstrated long-term reductions in populations of native organisms. Most researchers agree that this probably reflects the difficulty of carrying out convincing studies of competition between such mobile organisms, rather than a genuine absence of competitive effects. Effects on seed set of exotic weeds are easier to demonstrate. Exotic bees often exhibit marked preferences for visiting flowers of exotic plants. For example, in Australia and New Zealand many weeds from Europe are now visited by European honeybees and bumblebees. Introduced bees are primary pollinators of a number of serious weeds. Negative impacts of exotic bees need to be carefully assessed before further introductions are carried out.																		1543-592X	1545-2069		WOS:000220102000001

APIDOLOGIE				35	1			55	63		10.1051/apido:2003062				JAN-FEB 2004	2004	The ecology of all bumblebees (Bombus spp.) is similar, yet some species have declined greatly while others remain abundant. We examine whether abundance is related to diet breadth. The floral visits of bumblebees were examined on Salisbury Plain, UK. All of the species examined gathered pollen mostly from Fabaceae. All species gathered nectar from a broader range of flowers than they did pollen, and longer-tongued bees had a narrower diet breadth when collecting nectar. B. hortorum (the species with the longest tongue) specialized on Trifolium pratense. As predicted, abundant species had a broader diet than rare species. Species with similar-length tongues visiting similar flowers. However, interspecific competition did not appear to be important since species with similar tongue lengths and high niche overlap co-occurred at high abundance. We suggest that the rare species may be those with short colony cycles, in which dependence on high quality food to rear larvae quickly forces specialization.																		0044-8435			WOS:000187803100007

JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION				6	3			179	189		10.1023/A:1023239221447				SEP 2002	2002	Honeybees, Apis mellifera, have been introduced by man throughout the globe. More recently, other bee species including various bumblebees (Bombus spp.) have been introduced to several new regions. Here we examine the impacts of honeybees and the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, on native flower-visiting insects in Tasmania. To assess whether native insects have lower abundance or are excluded in areas that have been colonised by exotic bees, we quantified the abundance, diversity and floral preferences of flower-visiting insects at sites where bumblebees and honeybees were present, and compared them to sites where they were absent. This was achieved by hand searches at 67 sites, and by deploying sticky traps at 122 sites. Honeybees were by far the most abundant bee species overall, and dominated the bee fauna at most sites. There was considerable niche overlap between honeybees, bumblebees and native bees in terms of the flowers that they visited. Sites where bumblebees were established had similar species richness, diversity and abundance of native flower-visiting insects compared to sites where bumblebees were absent. In contrast, native bees were more than three times more abundant at the few sites where honeybees were absent, compared to those where they were present. Our results are suggestive of competition between honeybees and native bees, but exclusion experiments are needed to provide a definitive test.																		1366-638X	1572-9753		WOS:000208370600005

The successful introduction of four European Bombus species to the South Island of New Zealand from England (in 1885 and 1906) provides an opportunity to determine how important different forage plants (also introduced from the U.K.) are to two severely threatened European bumblebee species (Bombus ruderatus and B. subterraneus). In January 2003 we conducted a survey of bumblebee populations across 70 sites in the central and southern South Island, recording which plant species were being used as pollen and nectar sources for each Bombus species. All four bumblebee species showed a clear preference for plants of European origin. Only B. terrestris, the most polylectic species, was recorded feeding on native plant species. The longer-tongued bumblebees, B. hortorum, B. ruderatus, and B. subterraneus, foraged predominantly on just two plant species; Trifolium pratense for both nectar and pollen, and Echium vulgare for nectar. These plant species are now declining in abundance in the U.K. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that the loss of flower-rich meadows, particularly those containing populations of Fabaceae species with long corollae, is responsible for the decline of bumblebee species across Europe. Comparison with earlier bumblebee surveys suggests that long-tongued bumblebees may also be in decline in New Zealand, particularly B. subterraneus which is now very localised and scarce.																		0110-6465	1177-7788		WOS:000226147100006

This is commonly attributed to the decline in floral resources that has resulted from an intensification in farming practices. Here we assess growth of nests of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, in habitats providing different levels of floral resources. Experimental nests were placed out in conventional farmland, in farmland with flower-rich conservation measures and in suburban areas. Nests gained weight more quickly and attained a larger final size in suburban areas compared to elsewhere. The diversity of pollens gathered by bees was highest in suburban areas, and lowest in conventional farmland. Nests in suburban areas were also more prone to attack by the specialist bumblebee parasite Aphomia sociella, suggesting that this moth is more abundant in suburban areas than elsewhere. Overall, our results demonstrate that gardens provide a greater density and diversity of floral resources than farmland, and probably support larger populations of B. terrestris. Contrary to expectation, schemes deployed to enhance farmland biodiversity appear to have little measurable impact on nest growth of this bumblebee species. We argue that B. terrestris probably forage over a larger scale than that on which farms are managed, so that nest growth is determined by the management of a large number of neighbouring farms, 7 not just that in which the nest is located.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000173912100013	28547150

AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				23	6			539	549						DEC 1998	1998	Native vegetation near Hobart in Tasmania was investigated to determine whether it was being invaded by the recently introduced large earth bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus, 1758). This species was found to be established in high numbers in a variety of vegetation types from coastal heath, through sclerophyll forest, and subalpine shrubberies up to an altitude of 1100 m. Hence, it has the potential to spread through much of Tasmania and temperate, mesic regions of mainland Australia. It is highly polylectic, foraging on at least 66 native plant species from 21 families. While the most heavily visited species produced abundant nectar, the lack of predation on this species also allowed it to forage economically on small flowers in clusters. This foraging profile overlapped with those of all anthophilous insect families, all bee subgenera, and all species of nectarivorous birds which were encountered. Therefore, B. terrestris has the potential to compete with most native anthophiles and commercial honeybees. As it forages from some plant taxa which are not visited by the European honeybee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758, this species is impacting on plant-pollinator relationships which have previously been free from the effects of exotic bees.																		0307-692X			WOS:000077462900005

Chalicodoma spp. spent less time at each flower during the afternoon in quadrats where B. terrestris foraged than at quadrats from which B. terrestris was excluded, indicating that standing crops of nectar were depleted by B. terrestris during the course of the day. This decline in resources was associated with reductions in the numbers of flowers visited, and the amount of time spent foraging, by Chalicodoma spp. II is proposed that the native bees avoided foraging in the quadrat where B, terrestris occurred as a response to reduced foraging efficiency in that situation. Thus, B. terrestris displaced these two species of Chalicodoma through competition for a limited resource. The high densities at which B. terrestris occurred, together with its ability to Forage at lower ambient temperatures than the native bees, exacerbated the impact of this exotic species. The possibility that this will adversely affect pollination in G. huegelii is also discussed.																		0004-959X			WOS:000080646400006

Invasive ants often become highly abundant in their introduced range and can outnumber native ants. These numerical disparities underlie the competitive asymmetry between invasive ants and native ants and result from a complex interplay of behavioral, ecological, and genetic factors. Reductions in the diversity and abundance of native ants resulting from ant invasions give rise to a variety of direct and indirect effects on non-ant taxa. Invasive ants compete with and prey upon a diversity of other organisms, including some vertebrates, and may enter into or disrupt mutualistic interactions with numerous plants and other insects. Experimental studies and research focused on the native range ecology of invasive ants will be especially valuable contributions to this field of study.																		0066-4162			WOS:000180007000008

Since then wild colonies have developed and spread in some regions. In the present study, we measured the spatial distribution and temporal change in abundance of B. terrestris in the Chitose River Basin, Hokkaido, Japan to elucidate the relation of greenhouses to the bee's distribution and to evaluate its potential effects on native bumblebees. Bumblebees were collected with window traps in windbreak forests roughly 1, 2, 4, and 6 km NNW and SSE of a large greenhouse. The peak catch of B. terrestris queens occurred in early June, suggesting that they had successfully hibernated in the field. The distributions of B. terrestris and the native B. ardens were mutually exclusive, while the native B. hypocrita appeared at all sites. Catches of B. terrestris were restricted to within 4 km of the nearest greenhouse, suggesting that the invasion was still in the initial phase in this area. The reduction in abundance of the native bumblebees in the sites of high B. terrestris abundance suggests the presence of interspecies competition between B. terrestris and the native bumblebees during the early part of the colony activity, although such reduction in B. ardens can be explained by habitat suitability.																		1438-3896			WOS:000229109900010

JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY				43	5			940	948		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01199.x				OCT 2006	2006	1. Although invasive species are major topics of research, little consideration has been given to the implications of introducing non-native subspecies or beneficial organisms such as pollinators. However, the extensive trade in bumble bees as pollinators of glasshouse crops involves both. Within regions in Europe, the importation of non-native commercially reared subspecies of Bombus terrestris could endanger native bumble bees through competitive displacement and/or hybridization.2. This study made a direct ecological comparison between commercially imported and native B. terrestris colonies growing in the wild in the UK. In particular, using a paired design, we compared the nectar-foraging performance and reproductive outputs of commercial and native colonies growing under identical field conditions.3. Commercial colonies performed well in the field, with substantially higher nectar-foraging rates than native colonies in four out of five locations. Nectar-foraging performance was positively correlated with forager size, with commercial bees being consistently larger than native bees.4. All seven commercial colonies studied produced gynes (new queens), with two colonies each producing in excess of 50. In contrast, only two out of seven native colonies produced gynes, and those only produced small numbers (five in total). Males were produced by all colonies but there were no significant differences in numbers between commercial and native subspecies.5. Synthesis and applications. The high reproductive success of commercial colonies indicates that there is an appreciable risk that they will become established and spread within the UK. Furthermore, their superior foraging ability and large colony size could lead them to out-compete native bumble bees. Clearly the invasive potential of non-native subspecies and/or beneficial organisms should not be overlooked. With respect to the current importation of commercial bumble bees, we strongly recommend a precautionary approach: native species and subspecies should be locally reared and the use/disposal of bees should be strictly regulated.																		0021-8901	1365-2664		WOS:000239987700011

A population comparison of foraging performance in Bombus terrestris								OECOLOGIA				144	3			508	516		10.1007/s00442-005-0081-9				JUL 2005	2005	Worldwide trade in non-native bumblebees remains largely unrestricted despite well-documented cases where introductions of non-native bees have gone dramatically wrong. Within Europe, indiscriminate importation of non-native populations of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) for the pollination of glasshouse crops continues on a massive scale. However, no risk assessment has been conducted for these introductions, perhaps because B. terrestris is considered a native species, so shipping populations from one region to another has been implicitly assumed to present no risk. This view is clearly unjustified because Bombus terrestris populations differ significantly in their genetic makeup as demonstrated by strong differences in coat colour and behavioural traits. Therefore, for the first time we compare an important competitive trait, namely foraging performance, between commercially available B. terrestris populations in contrasting environments. We test whether commercially reared populations differ in their nectar foraging performance and whether this is influenced by both their source environment and the one they are introduced into. We do this by means of a reciprocal transplant experiment. Strong, consistent interpopulation differences in performance occurred irrespective of test location: Canary Island bees (B.t. canariensis) were superior to Sardinian bees (B.t. sassaricus), which were generally superior to mainland European bees (B.t. terrestris). These inter-population differences in performance were largely explained by inter-population variation in forager size, with larger bees being superior foragers. However, even when body size was accounted for, "native" bees were not superior to transplanted non-native bees in all but one case. We conclude that non-native populations, especially those with large foragers, can be highly competitive foragers. This could lead to their establishment and displacement of native bees. Therefore, we recommend that unregulated movements of non-native B. terrestris populations within Europe should not be carried out without a full risk assessment.																		0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000231247800019	15891827

To control this invasive species, it is necessary to understand its ecological traits in its newly established range. Here, we investigated the colony growth pattern and reproductive ability of feral nests of B. terrestris in northern Japan from 2003 to 2006. Nests collected at various times showed initially slow growth followed by rapid development. This pattern is consistent with findings in previous studies using laboratory-raised colonies. Our results also suggested that protandrous colonies tend to specialize in male production, whereas protogynous colonies specialize in gyne production, producing a split sex ratio in feral colonies of B. terrestris. The numerical population sex ratio was 1.40 gynes per male, calculated from the numbers of pre-emergence cocoons for gynes and males, showing a female-biased sex ratio at the population level. Mature colonies produced a mean of 376.5 cocoons and 90.2 gyne cocoons (22.1% of the total). The proportion of gynes produced by B. terrestris nests exceeded both those of conspecifics observed in other countries and those of consubgeneric native Japanese species. The propagule pressure hypothesis appears to explain the probability of establishment of this invasive species. Suitable nest sites for B. terrestris queens appeared to be in short supply, and B. terrestris may win usurpation contests against native species due to its large size, resulting in the decline of native bumblebee species.																		0020-1812			WOS:000273479800005

(Hymenoptera : Apidae)								JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION				12	2			135	146		10.1007/s10841-007-9071-z				APR 2008	2008	The introduced Bombus terrestris has recently been naturalized in Japan and become dominant in some local communities. We investigated potential niche overlaps between introduced and native bumblebees in terms of morphological characteristics, seasonal flight activity, foraging and nesting habitat use, and plant species visited. There were considerable niche overlaps in flower resource use between B. terrestris and B. hypocrita sapporoensis/B. pseudobaicalensis. Bombus terrestris also potentially competes for nest sites with B. hypocrita sapporoensis. During 3-year monitoring, B. pseudobaicalensis showed no noticeable change, but B. hypocrita sapporoensis decreased while B. terrestris increased. Abundant flower resources provided by exotic plants may buffer native bumblebees from competition for food with introduced species. By contrast, the number of nest usurpers found in B. terrestris nests increased between 2003 and 2005, indicating that availability of nest sites was limiting and queens strongly competed for nest sites. Our findings suggest that competition for nest sites rather than flower resources is the major ecological mechanism for displacement of native bees. The large reduction of B. hypocrita sapporoensis queen indicates that B. terrestris may cause local extinction of native bumblebees. Control of established B. terrestris populations and prevention of further range expansion are urgently needed.																		1366-638X	1572-9753		WOS:000253572400005

This brought about the irregular arrangement of batches. 4) Colony size was not so large as compared with that of B. ignitus and B. diversus, the number of cocoons/colony rarely exceeded 500. 5) Output of new queens was also relatively small and the average number of queen cocoons/mature colony was 64. 6. 6) Only one adult female of the pupal parasitoid, Mutilla europaea mikado Cameron, was found in one of 8 nests.

There is every indication that the rate at which locations are accumulating non-native species is accelerating as free trade and globalization advance. Thus, the need to incorporate predictive models in the assessment of invasion risk has become acute. However, finding elements of the invasion process that provide consistent explanatory power has proved elusive. Here, we propose propagule pressure as a key element to understanding why some introduced populations fail to establish whereas others succeed. In the process, we illustrate how the study of propagule pressure can provide an opportunity to tie together disparate research agendas within invasion ecology.																		0169-5347	1872-8383		WOS:000229141400004	16701373

They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these immigrations.The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous "tax" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable.Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment constitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem-wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a "guilty until proven innocent" approach would be a productive first step.Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. Left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways.																		1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000087506600008

Oil well drilling, the major anthropogenic disturbance over the past 21 years in the area, was used as an indirect measure of propagule pressure. An analysis of 82 potential introductions at oil production platforms revealed that the probability of successful establishment significantly increased with the number of drilling events. Specifically, the shape of the dose-response establishment curve could be closely approximated by a Poisson process with a 34% chance of infestation per well drilled. Consistent with our knowledge of largely clonal reproduction by W. auropunctata, the shape of the establishment curve suggested that the ants were not substantially affected by Allee effects, probably greatly contributing to this species' success as an invader. By contrast, the extent to which W. auropunctata spread beyond the point of initial introduction, and thus the extent of its damage to diversity of other ant species, was independent of propagule pressure. These results suggest that while establishment success depends on propagule pressure, other ecological or genetic factors may limit the extent of further spread. Knowledge of the shape of the dose-response establishment curve should prove useful in modelling the future spread of W. auropunctata and perhaps the spread of other clonal organisms.																		1366-9516	1472-4642		WOS:000252966500016		
J	Moller, H								Lessons for invasion theory from social insects								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				78	1-2			125	142		10.1016/0006-3207(96)00022-5				OCT-NOV 1996	1996	Reproductive and dispersal modes of social insects mean that fundamentally different models may be required for predicting determinants of their invasions from those for sexually reproducing non-social animals or non-insects. This suggests that it is unrealistic to expect the same predictors of invasiveness will apply to all biota. Many species of social wasps, bees and ants are extraordinarily invasive. The main general advantage promoting invasiveness of social insects may be the flexibilities arising from having both individual and colony responses that enable them to withstand biotic resistance and to better match conditions in the receiving community. Social insect invasion case studies have revealed strong evidence for biotic resistance to invasions in some instances. Intercorrelated species characters and ecological variations in different disturbance regimes, regions, habitats and community histories hamper further advances in the understanding of invasion biology from comparing invasive and non-invasive species. Mole incorporation of models of conservation biology, community ecology and genetics may assist invasion biology. Experimentally designed release programmes and detailed follow-up studies of biological control agents could greatly assist the quest for better invasion models. More prolonged invasion case studies, where the underlying mechanisms of invasion are researched, and experimental manipulations are the best way that a more robust and predictive theory oof invasions can be generated. Social insects provide splendid opportunities for such research. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited																		0006-3207	1873-2917		WOS:A1996VP46800011

We examined the effects of land use and bumblebee abundance on the number and body size of bumblebees collected using window traps in a lowland area in the southern Ishikari district, Hokkaido. In 2004, we collected 922 bumblebees of six species using 70 traps at 17 sites. A statistical model fitted to the data demonstrated that dispersion from commercial B. terrestris colonies used in greenhouses positively affected the number of B. terrestris caught by each trap. This exotic species was abundant in sites where paddy fields were prevalent, but three native species, B. hypocrita, B. ardens, and B. diversus, were abundant in sites where farms and woodlands were widespread. The local abundance of B. terrestris was not associated negatively with the number and body size of native bumblebees. Thus, we did not find any competitive interactions between exotic and native bumblebees although habitat conditions seem to be common determinants of the bumblebee populations. A morphological analysis showed that B. terrestris had intermediate tongue length between B. hypocrita and B. ardens.																		0912-3814			WOS:000244483400019

Analysis of these conflicts has become an important focus of research into the role of kin selection in shaping social traits of hymenopteran colonies. We employ microsatellite analysis of nestmates of one social hymenopteran, the primitively eusocial and monogynous bumblebee Bombus hypnorum, to evaluate these conflicts. In our 14 study colonies, B. hypnorum queens mated between one and six times (arithmetic mean 2.5). One male generally predominated, fathering most of the offspring, thus the effective number of matings was substantially lower (1-3.13; harmonic mean 1.26). In addition, microsatellite analysis allowed the detection of alien workers, those who could not have been the offspring of the queen, in approximately half the colonies. Alien workers within the same colony were probably sisters. Polyandry and alien workers resulted in high variation among colonies in their sociogenetic organization. Genetic data were consistent with the view that all males (n = 233 examined) were produced by a colony's queen. Male parentage was therefore independent of the sociogenetic organization of the colony, suggesting that the queen, and not the workers, was in control of the laying of male-destined eggs. The population-wide sex ratio (fresh weight investment ratio) was weakly female biased. No evidence for colony-level adaptive sex ratio biasing could be detected.																		0962-1083			WOS:000171693700011	11742549

Five species of bumblebees are currently used for crop pollination, the major ones being Bombus terrestris from Eurasia and Bombus impatiens from North America. As a result of their frequent use in foreign territories, there have been reports of B. terrestris becoming established, as well as interactions and/or competition with local (bumble-) bee fauna. Of the many vegetable, fruit and seed crops that bumblebees pollinate, greenhouse tomatoes are of predominant importance. In 2004, 40 000 ha of tomato crops were pollinated, with a crop value of e 12 000 million. The growers benefit from bumblebee pollination because of lower production costs, increased yields, and improved fruit quality. The interrelationship between commercial mechanisms and ecological risks is discussed.																		0044-8435	1297-9678		WOS:000238973900002
