CHARACTERIZATION OF NATIVE HONEY BEE SUBSPECIES IN REPUBLIC OF BENIN USING MORPHOMETRIC AND GENETIC TOOLS	JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Apis mellifera; ecotype; Republic of Benin; subtype	APIS-MELLIFERA L; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA SEQUENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY; POPULATIONS; DIVERSITY; IMPACT; MICROSATELLITE; IDENTIFICATION; VARIABILITY	Morphometry characteristics combined with genetic markers are powerful tools used for determining honey bee subspecies. Bees samples collected from 94 established apiaries distributed throughout all of the Republic of Benin were morphometricaly characterized using seven parameters and the COI-COII regions of mitochondrial DMA were sequenced. Based on the morphometric data the native honey bees could be divided into three distinct ecotypes - the Benino-dry-tropical-ecotype in the north, the Benino-Sudanian-ecotype in the central part and the Benino-Sudano-Guinean-ecotype in the south . The DNA COI-COII regions sequence analyses confirmed that the honey bee population of the Republic of Benin belongs to different mitotypes but do not correspond with the determined eco- types. We could determine three new haplotypes which missed the P-0 segment but the Q region was duplicated or triplicated. Phylogenetic analyses clustered them together in the A evolutionary lineage. In conclusion, morphometric and genetic analysis of the na- tive West African honey bees indicated that each of the different mitotypes was able to adapt to the different ecological conditions in the country by morphometric adjustments.

J	Leach, H; Isaacs, R				Leach, Heather; Isaacs, Rufus			Seasonal Occurrence of Key Arthropod Pests and Beneficial Insects in Michigan High Tunnel and Field Grown Raspberries	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Rubus ideaus; protected culture; phenology; integrated pest management; pollinator	SPOTTED WING DROSOPHILA; DIPTERA DROSOPHILIDAE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; PROTECTED CULTURE; FRUIT PRODUCTION; SUZUKII; MANAGEMENT; US; HYMENOPTERA; POPULATIONS	Berry crops are increasingly produced in high tunnels, which provide growers with the opportunity to extend their production season. This is particularly beneficial for the northern region of the United States with short and unpredictable growing seasons and where rainfall limits fruit quality. However, little is known about the effect of high tunnels on the community of pests, natural enemies, or pollinators, especially in berry crops, and there are few reports of the insect community in raspberries in this region. We compared the abundance of these insects during two growing seasons in field-grown and tunnel-grown floricane and primocane producing raspberries through direct observation and trapping at five sites in southwestern and central Michigan. We found eight key pests, including spotted wing Drosophila, leafhoppers, and thrips, and seven key natural enemies including parasitoid wasps, spiders, and lacewings, that were common across all sites. Pest populations were up to 6.6 times higher in tunnels, and pests typical of greenhouse systems became more dominant in this environment. Natural enemies observed on plants under tunnels were also more abundant than in the field, but this trend was reversed for natural enemies trapped on yellow sticky cards. There was also a reduction of both honey bees and wild bees under the high tunnels, which was balanced by use of commercial bumble bees. These data not only provide much-needed information on the phenology of the insect community on raspberry plantings, they also highlight the entomological implications of protected raspberry culture.

J	Gilley, DC; Courtright, TJ; Thom, C				Gilley, D. C.; Courtright, T. J.; Thom, C.			Phenology of Honey Bee Swarm Departure in New Jersey, United States	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						phenology; swarm; growing degree-day; climate; temperature	APPLY SURVIVAL TRAITS; APIS-MELLIFERA; HYMENOPTERA; PREVENTION; COLONIES; APIDAE; TIME	Departure of swarms from honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) nests is an important reproductive event for wild honey bee colonies and economically costly in managed bee colonies. The seasonal timing of swarm departure varies regionally and annually, creating challenges for honey bee management and emphasizing the potential for swarming behavior to be affected by plant-pollinator phenological mismatch. In this study, we first document variability in the timing of swarm departure across the large and heterogeneous geographical area of New Jersey over 4 years using 689 swarm-cluster observations. Second, hypothesizing that honey bee colonies adaptively tune the timing of swarm departure to match floral food-resource availability, we predicted that growing degree-days could be used to account for regional and annual variability. To test this idea, we used local weather records to determine the growing degree-day on which each swarm cluster was observed and tested for differences among climate regions and years. The state-wide mean swarm cluster date was May 15 (+/- 0.6 d), with moderate but significant differences among the state's five climate regions and between years. Use of degree-day information suggests that local heat accumulation can account for some climate-region differences in swarm-departure timing. Annual variation existed on a scale of only several days and was not accounted for by growing degree-days, suggesting little adaptive tuning of swarm-departure timing with respect to local heat accumulation.

Bee species recorded between 1992 and 2017 from green roofs in Asia, Europe, and North America, with key characteristics and open research questions	APIDOLOGIE			English	Review						Bees; Cavity-nesting species; Ground-nesting species; Species diversity; Urban habitats	HABITAT CONNECTIVITY; DIVERSITY	Green roofs, which have become mandatory on new flat-topped buildings in many cities, increase habitat connectivity for wildlife and have contributed to a boom in urban beekeeping. The ecological benefits or risks of green roofs for wild bees (bee species other than the domesticated honey bee, Apis mellifera), however, have not been comprehensively analyzed. We therefore reviewed studies on insects caught on green roofs in Asia, Europe, or North America between 1992 and early 2017 and extracted information on wild bees. The resulting species list includes 236 Apidae identified in 35 studies, with thermophilic species probably overrepresented because roofs provide warm and dry habitats. The percentage of cavity-nesting bees on roofs is higher than that on nearby ground, while the percentage of pollen specialists is lower. Data are almost completely lacking on the reproductive success of bees on green roofs, the effect of roof age on bee diversity, and the genetic or demographic benefits of increased habitat connectivity. Our list of the bee species so far reported on green roofs will help in the selection and implementation of suitable soils, nesting aids, and plantings.

Evaluating the persistence of fluorescent and protein powders on adult blue orchard bees, Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), for mark-capture studies	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						proteinmarking; ELISA; dispersal; retention; pollination	PROPINQUA HYMENOPTERA; APIS-MELLIFERA; POLLINATION; POPULATIONS; BEHAVIOR; APPLE; RANGE; SET	The managed, solitary bee, Osmia lignaria Say, is an efficient pollinator of orchard crops. One limitation to their commercial success is high dispersal of populations away from orchards, resulting in low establishment in provided nest cavities even when optimal pollination is achieved. While exact causes for dispersal are unknown, many existing theories remain untested due to complications with evaluating O. lignaria establishment in field settings. We describe relatively simple and reliable methods for passively marking O. lignaria with egg albumin and casein powdered proteins combined with orange fluorescent powder as they emerge from cocoons. Marked adults were examined microscopically at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 days after emergence for the fluorescent powder followed by an anti-albumin and anti-casein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the protein powders. The orange powder and egg albumin were highly persistent on adults throughout the 18-day study, suggesting the utility of these markers for studying dispersal and retention of O. lignaria in the field.

Different bees, different needs: how nest-site requirements have shaped the decision-making processes in homeless honeybees (Apis spp.)	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Apis; decentralized decision-making; honeybees; nest-site selection	RED DWARF HONEYBEE; SCOUTS GUIDE; SELECTION; SWARMS; COLONIES; DORSATA; BEHAVIOR; HYMENOPTERA; INFORMATION; ENTOMOLOGY	During reproductive swarming, a honeybee swarm needs to decide on a new nest site and then move to the chosen site collectively. Most studies of swarming and nest-site selection are based on one species, Apis mellifera. Natural colonies of A. mellifera live in tree cavities. The quality of the cavity is critical to the survival of a swarm. Other honeybee species nest in the open, and have less strict nest-site requirements, such as the open-nesting dwarf honeybee Apis florea. Apis florea builds a nest comprised of a single comb suspended from a twig. For a cavity-nesting species, there is only a limited number of potential nest sites that can be located by a swarm, because suitable sites are scarce. By contrast, for an open-nesting species, there is an abundance of equally suitable twigs. While the decision-making process of cavity-nesting bees is geared towards selecting the best site possible, open-nesting species need to coordinate collective movement towards areas with potential nest sites. Here, we argue that the nest-site selection processes of A. florea and A. mellifera have been shaped by each species' specific nest-site requirements. Both species use the same behavioural algorithm, tuned to allow each species to solve their species-specific problem. This article is part of the theme issue 'Collective movement ecology'.

J	Chakrabarti, P; Sarkar, S; Basu, P				Chakrabarti, Priyadarshini; Sarkar, Sagartirtha; Basu, Parthiba			Field Populations of Wild Apis cerana Honey Bees Exhibit Increased Genetic Diversity Under Pesticide Stress Along an Agricultural Intensification Gradient in Eastern India	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						agricultural intensification; wild population; genetic diversity; isozyme study; RAPD-PCR study	MELLIFERA L.; DNA; AMPLIFICATION; POLYMORPHISM; SENSITIVITY; RELEVANCE; ESTERASES; ECOLOGY	Pesticides have been reported to be one of the major drivers in the global pollinator losses. The large-scale decline in honey bees, an important pollinator group, has resulted in comprehensive studies on honey bee colonies. Lack of information on native wild pollinators has paved the way for this study, which highlights the underlying evolutionary changes occurring in the wild honey bee populations exposed to pesticides along an agricultural intensification landscape. The study reports an increased genetic diversity in native Apis cerana Fabricius (Hymenoptera: Apidae) populations continually exposed to pesticide stress. An increased heterozygosity, evidenced by a higher electrophoretic banding pattern, was observed in the pesticide-exposed populations for two isozymes involved with xenobiotic metabolism-esterase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Differential banding patterns also revealed a higher percentage of polymorphic loci, number of polymorphic bands, Nei's genetic distance, etc. observed in these populations in the Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR) experiments using three random decamer primers. Higher heterozygosity, being indicative of a more resistant population, implies population survival within the threshold pesticide stress. This study reports such changes for the first time in native wild Indian honey bee populations exposed to pesticides and has far-reaching implications on the population adaptability under pesticide stress.

Here, we review the mechanisms through which animal and plant invasive species may affect pollinators, either directly or indirectly. We classified these mechanisms in four groups: (a) changes in habitat quantity or quality, (b) predation, (c) pathogen spread and (d) genetic introgression. We review the impacts of these mechanisms on the behaviour, demography and evolution of native pollinators and their communities. In addition, we highlight some current knowledge gaps about the effect of biological invasions on pollinators and suggest some measures to minimize such effects.

This bee is very aggressive, nervous, and produces many broods with many queen cells. It is prone to swarming and exhibits defensive behavior and an abundant use of propolis. In the present study, pure line samples of A. m. intermissa collected from Blida (Algeria; 36 degrees 31N, 2 degrees 58E) with preferable Varroa resistance confirmed their through hygienic cleaning behavior and high temperature adaptation, were selected as a reference sample for full-genome sequencing. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was also performed on the same samples to validate genomic variations. These analyses will be an important source of information for the honey bee research community worldwide. The 240-Mb genome was annotated with 26355 transcripts and analyzed. Analysis of 133 pathways indicated an abundance of pathways related to metabolic processes, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biodegradation of xenobiotics . In addition to simple sequence repeat markers, variant analysis for beneficial trait genes, transposons, and phylogeny was performed. The mitochondrial genome and genes involved in immunity and chemoreception were identified and compared with those from other sequenced insect models. The indels obtained by sequencing were validated by aCGH. The genome sequence, annotation, and analysis of A. m. intermissa provides new understanding of the function of bee genes, and comparison with the genome of other A. mellifera subspecies promises to yield insights into the evolution of the adaptations to high temperature and resistance to Varroa parasite infestation.

The composition of agro-ecological landscapes is thought to have important implications for the production of major crops through its effects on pollinator abundance and behaviour. 2. We explored the roles of land cover and land cover heterogeneity on bee nest distribution for the giant honeybee Apis dorsata, a key species for coffee pollination, in a complex agroforest landscape. We emphasized scaling and non-uniform effects by combining two different approaches of spatial analysis, the point-pattern analysis and surface-pattern analysis. 3. We found non-exclusive, positive effects of agroforests, forest fragments and land-cover heterogeneity on the presence and number of nests. The distribution of nests responded to habitat heterogeneity at small scale (< 100 m), forest fragments at medium scale (< 300 m) and to agroforest at larger scales (500 m to 2 km). Our multiple approaches highlight that the landscape effects were neither linear nor uniform within the study zone. Nests were consistently located in areas of medium agroforest density or medium to high forest density, but were absent where forest fragments are the most concentrated. 4. The agroforest matrix was particularly important in shaping the size of nest aggregates. Nests tended to be few when there is low tree cover at broad scale, while nests were numerous when agroforest patches are abundant within the bees'-foraging range. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study revealed that structurally complex landscapes appear to support bee populations. The spatial arrangement of different land covers affected honeybee nest distributions by providing nesting and foraging-resources across multiple scales. The results suggest that continued intensification of small forest fragments and expansion of large monospecies plantations will be deleterious to the populations of giant honeybees A. dorsata. Fragmentation of the agroforestry matrix at small scales (100s m) does not, however, appear detrimental for A. dorsata as long as sufficient diversified resources are available at the landscape scale (kms).

In spite of being considered a beneficial species, there is a controversy around its impact on natural habitats caused by its high densities. Here we review the most important effects and mechanisms attributed to an increase in honey bee abundance on plants and wild bees. We found that the impacts can be negative and positive as well, playing an important role the ecological context (resource availability, wild pollinator community, etc.) and the honey bee density. Effects occur at the individual, population, and community level, affecting plant-pollinator networks, while the consequences for ecosystem functioning and crop pollination are still uncertain. It has been recently shown that the honey bee can also act as a selective force affecting plant evolution in a relative short time. The parasite and pathogen transmission from honey bees to wild pollinators has become a relevant issue in the last years. Although honey bees can benefit wild plants pollination, because impacts in other bees are primary negative, we should be careful with hives introduction at natural sites. Especially until we can determine the parasites and pathogen transmission consequences.	[Aguero, J. I.; Torretta, J.

Alien honeybees increase pollination risks for range-restricted plants	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						endemism; honeybee; invasive; mutualism; pollination; range size	MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; INTEGRATION; NESTEDNESS; PATTERNS; INVASION; ISLANDS; ECOLOGY; EGYPT	AimRange-restricted species are of high conservation concern, and the way in which they interact with more widespread species has implications for their persistence. Here, we determine how the specialization of mutualistic interactions varies with respect to the geographic range size of plants and pollinators and assess how they respond to the introduction of the alien honeybee. We also compare network characteristics (connectance, specialization and nestedness) between an invaded low mountain and non-invaded high mountain network. LocationSt Katherine Protectorate, South Sinai, Egypt. MethodsWe quantified bee-plant interactions in 42 plots between April and July 2013 and created visitation networks for the low mountains (beehives present) and the high mountains (beehives absent). We then compared visitation network metrics between range-restricted, regionally distributed and widespread plants and pollinators and assessed topological differences between the low and high mountain networks. ResultsRange-restricted bees were involved in a significantly higher number of total interactions than regional and widespread native bees, but showed no evidence of increased generalization. In contrast, range-restricted plants were involved in fewer interactions and exhibited significantly higher specialization and a high dependency on range-restricted pollinators. The introduced honeybee acted as a super-generalist and was associated with an increase in network-level generalization and nestedness. Honeybees exhibited high levels of resource overlap with range-restricted bees and made few visits to range-restricted plant species. Main conclusionsRange-restricted plants are more specialized in their interactions than range-restricted pollinators, suggesting that the forces shaping the structure of interaction network can vary between partners. Alien honeybees made few visits to range-restricted plants, but exhibited disproportionately high levels of floral competition with range-restricted bees. If high levels of competition lead to population declines then specialized range-restricted plants will be at higher risk of pollen deficits than more widespread species.

QUEEN; BEE	The honeybee is one of the most valuable insect pollinators, playing a key role in pollinating wild vegetation and agricultural crops, with significant contribution to the world's food production. Although honeybees have long been studied as model for social evolution, honeybee biology at the molecular level remained poorly understood until the year 2006. With the availability of the honeybee genome sequence and technological advancements in protein separation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics, aspects of honeybee biology such as developmental biology, physiology, behavior, neurobiology, and immunology have been explored to new depths at molecular and biochemical levels. This Review comprehensively summarizes the recent progress in honeybee biology using proteomics to study developmental physiology, task transition, and physiological changes in some of the organs, tissues, and cells based on achievements from the authors' laboratory in this field. The research advances of honeybee proteomics provide new insights for understanding of honeybee biology and future research directions.

Interestingly, no scientific data are available, neither about the past nor the present status of naturally nesting honeybee colonies. We expected near-natural beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests to provide enough suitable nest sites to be a home for feral honey bee colonies in Europe. Here, we made a first assessment of their occurrence and density in two German woodland areas based on two methods, the tracing of nest sites based on forager flight routes (beelining technique), and the direct inspection of potential cavity trees. Further, we established experimental swarms at forest edges and decoded dances for nest sites performed by scout bees in order to study how far swarms from beekeeper-managed hives would potentially move into a forest. We found that feral honey bee colonies regularly inhabit tree cavities in near-natural beech forests at densities of at least 0.11-0.14 colonies/km(2). Colonies were not confined to the forest edges; they were also living deep inside the forests. We estimated a median distance of 2,600 m from the bee trees to the next apiaries, while scout bees in experimental swarms communicated nest sites in close distances (median: 470 m). We extrapolate that there are several thousand feral honey bee colonies in German woodlands. These have to be taken in account when assessing the role of forest areas in providing pollination services to the surrounding land, and their occurrence has implications for the species' perception among researchers, beekeepers and conservationists. This study provides a starting point for investigating the life-histories and the ecological interactions of honey bees in temperate European forest environments.

NOV.; DIVERSITY; TERRESTRIS; HYMENOPTERA; COMMUNITY; POLLINATION	Recent declines in bumble bee populations are of great concern and have prompted critical evaluations of the role of pathogen introductions and host resistance in bee health. One factor that may influence host resilience when facing infection is the gut microbiota. Previous experiments with Bombus terrestris, a European bumble bee, showed that the gut microbiota can protect against Crithidia bombi, a widespread trypanosomatid parasite of bumble bees. However, the particular characteristics of the microbiome responsible for this protective effect have thus far eluded identification. Using wild and commercially sourced Bombus impatiens, an important North American pollinator, we conducted cross-wise microbiota transplants to naive hosts of both backgrounds and challenged them with a Crithidia parasite. As with B. terrestris, we find that microbiota-dependent protection against Crithidia operates in B. impatiens. Lower Crithidia infection loads were experimentally associated with high microbiome diversity, large gut bacterial populations, and the presence of Apibacter, Lactobacillus Firm-5, and Gilliamella spp. in the gut community. These results indicate that even subtle differences between gut community structures can have a significant impact on a microbiome's ability to defend against parasite infections. IMPORTANCE Many wild bumble bee populations are under threat due to human activity, including through the introduction of pathogens via commercially raised bees. Recently, it was found that the bumble bee gut microbiota can help defend against a common parasite, Crithidia bombi, but the particular factors contributing to this protection are unknown. Using both wild and commercially raised bees, we conducted microbiota transplants to show that microbiome diversity, total gut bacterial load, and the presence of certain core members of the microbiota may all impact bee susceptibility to Crithidia infection. Bee origin (genetic background) was also a factor. Finally, by examining this phenomenon in a previously uninvestigated bee species, our study demonstrates that microbiome-mediated resistance to Crithidia is conserved across multiple bumble bee species. These findings highlight how intricate interactions between hosts, microbiomes, and parasites can have wide-ranging consequences for the health of ecologically important species.

J	Funfhaus, A; Ebeling, J; Genersch, E				Fuenfhaus, Anne; Ebeling, Julia; Genersch, Elke			Bacterial pathogens of bees	CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE			English	Review							LARVAE SUBSP LARVAE; HONEYBEE APIS-MELLIFERA; CORN STUNT DISEASE; AMERICAN FOULBROOD DISEASE; COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE; 16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; PAENIBACILLUS-LARVAE; MELISSOCOCCUS-PLUTONIUS; SPIROPLASMA-MELLIFERUM; BACILLUS-SPHAERICUS	Pollination is an indispensable ecosystem service provided by many insects, especially by wild and managed bee species. Hence, reports on large scale honey bee colony losses and on population declines of many wild bees were alarming and resulted in increased awareness of the importance of bee health and increased interest in bee pathogens. To serve this interest, this review will give a comprehensive overview on bacterial bee pathogens by covering not only the famous pathogens (Paenibacillus larvae, Melissococcus plutonius), but also the orphan pathogens which have largely been neglected by the scientific community so far (spiroplasmas) and the pathogens which were only recently discovered as being pathogenic to bees (Serratia marcescens, Lysinibacillus sphaericus).

J	McMenamin, AJ; Flenniken, ML				McMenamin, Alexander J.; Flenniken, Michelle L.			Recently identified bee viruses and their impact on bee pollinators	CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE			English	Review							DEFORMED-WING-VIRUS; ACUTE PARALYSIS VIRUS; HONEYBEES APIS-MELLIFERA; COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER; MACULA-LIKE VIRUS; LAKE SINAI VIRUS; VARROA-DESTRUCTOR; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; RNA VIRUSES; INFECTION	Bees are agriculturally and ecologically important plant pollinators. Recent high annual losses of honey bee colonies, and reduced populations of native and wild bees in some geographic locations, may impact the availability of affordable food crops and the diversity and abundance of native and wild plant species. Multiple factors including viral infections affect pollinator health. The majority of well-characterized bee viruses are picorna-like RNA viruses, which may be maintained as covert infections or cause symptomatic infections or death. Next generation sequencing technologies have been utilized to identify additional bee-infecting viruses including the Lake Sinai viruses and Rhabdoviruses. In addition, sequence data is instrumental for defining specific viral strains and characterizing associated pathogenicity, such as the recent characterization of Deformed wing virus master variants (DWV-DA,DWV-B, and DWV-C) and their impact on bee health.

Hereto the interaction effects of wild bee decline with multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors need to be clear. This is also true for the driver 'pathogens', as stressor induced disturbances of natural host-pathogen dynamics can unbalance settled virulence equilibria. Invasive species, bee domestication, habitat loss, climate changes and insecticides are recognized drivers of wild bee decline, but all influence host-pathogen dynamics as well. Many wild bee pathogens have multiple hosts, which relaxes the host-density limitation of virulence evolution. In conclusion, disturbances of bee-pathogen dynamics can be compared to a game of Russian roulette.

Dealing with mutualists and antagonists: Specificity of plant-mediated interactions between herbivores and flower visitors, and consequences for plant fitness	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Brassica nigra; feeding guild; feeding site; florivores; flower visitors; folivores; herbivore-induced plant responses; plant reproduction	RAPE BRASSICA-NAPUS; POLLEN BEETLE; INDUCED RESISTANCE; INSECT HERBIVORES; WILD RADISH; POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; SECONDARY METABOLITES; VOLATILE EMISSIONS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; INDUCED RESPONSES	Plants need to deal with antagonists, such as herbivores, while maintaining interactions with mutualists, such as pollinators that help plants to maximize their reproductive output. Although many plant species have inducible defences to save metabolic costs of defence in the absence of herbivores, plant responses induced by herbivore attack can have ecological costs. For example, herbivore-induced responses can affect flower traits and alter interactions with flower visitors. Such plant-mediated interactions between herbivores and flower visitors can affect plant reproductive output. Current knowledge on the generality and specificity of plant-mediated herbivore-flower-visitor interactions and its consequences for plant fitness is limited. In this study, we investigated whether a broad range of herbivores feeding on the annual plant Brassica nigra affect interactions with flower visitors, whether the direction of interactions is predicted by the feeding modes (chewing and sap-feeding) and sites (above- and belowground) of the herbivores, and whether it results in fitness consequences for the plant. Our results show that attack of B. nigra by a range of different herbivores influenced plant interactions with mutualist pollinators and an antagonist florivore, the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus. Pollinator community composition was affected by herbivory, whereas overall pollinator attraction was maintained. Pollinator community composition of uninfested plants differed from that of chewing and root herbivore-infested plants. Main responders in the pollinator communities to changes induced by herbivory were syrphid flies, bumblebees, and solitary bees. Although the preference of pollen beetle adults was not affected by herbivory, beetle larvae performed best on plants infested with the nematode Heterodera schachtii. The changes in pollinator community composition and syrphid fly visitation can explain the observed increase in seed set of root herbivore-infested plants. Interactions of flowering B. nigra plants with mutualist and antagonist insects are well integrated and conflicting interactions do not reduce reproductive output. Our results suggest some degree of specificity in herbivore-flower-visitor interactions with consequences for plant fitness. Specificity of plant responses were determined at the species level as well as the herbivore functional group level, and differed depending on the flower visitor. Because plant reproduction was affected by indirect plant-mediated interactions, these can potentially result in selection on plant strategies to optimize growth, defence and reproduction.

Here, smallholder farmers produce fruits and vegetables in homegardens that depend upon or benefit from bee pollination. We hypothesized that abundance and richness of wild and domesticated bees and the complexity of plant-pollinator interactions are higher in homegardens surrounded by woody habitats than in homegardens found farther from woodlands. Bees were sampled in 20 homegardens in the rice terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras. We used linear mixed effect models to analyse effects of woody habitats around homegardens on bee richness and abundance. Based on pooled observations for each garden category, we built pollinator-plant interactions networks to illustrate shifts in interaction frequencies. We recorded 354 bee individuals of 13 wild and one domesticated bee species (Apis cerana). Wild bee richness was significantly higher in homegardens surrounded by woody habitats. Bee abundance increased significantly with increasing flower cover. Wild bees visited cultivated plants significantly more often than domesticated bees. Six vegetable species and 76% of all flower visits on cultivated plants in total were performed by wild bees and three plant species and 24% by domesticated bees. Pollinator-plant networks were more complex in homegardens surrounded by woody habitats. We conclude that woody habitats increase abundance and richness of wild and domesticated bees. Increasing availability of floral resources also promotes bee abundance. In order to promote pollination services in the landscape mosaic of smallholder rice farms, woody habitats and forest fragments together with numerous floral resources should be protected and restored.

The biology and prevalence of fungal diseases in managed and wild bees	CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE			English	Review							ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE; ASCOSPHAERA-AGGREGATA SKOU; SPORE CYST FUNGUS; MEGACHILE-ROTUNDATA; HONEY-BEE; APIS-MELLIFERA; CRESSON HYMENOPTERA; APIDAE COLONIES; GUT MICROBIOTA; OSMIA-LIGNARIA	Managed and wild bees, whether solitary or social have a plethora of microbial associations that vary in their influence on the health of the bees. In this review, we summarise our current knowledge of aspects of the biology and ecology of bee associated fungi. The biology of bees that fungi are associated with are described, and the likely influences on fungal transmission are discussed. There is a clear disparity in research on fungi associated with managed compared to wild bees, leaving gaps in our understanding of fungal pathogen epidemiology. Translocation of bees to meet global pollination needs will increase exposure of bees to exotic pathogens.

Fruit Set and Single Visit Stigma Pollen Deposition by Managed Bumble Bees and Wild Bees in Citrullus lanatus (Cucurbitales: Cucurbitaceae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						bumble bees; Melissodes; Agapostemon; watermelon; pollination	WATERMELON	Pollinators provide essential services for watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.; Cucurbitales: Cucurbitaceae). Managed bumble bees, Bombus impatiens (Cresson; Hymenoptera: Apidae), have been shown to be a useful watermelon pollinator in some areas. However, the exact contribution bumble bees make to watermelon pollination and how their contribution compares to that of other bees is unclear. We used large cages (5.4 x 2.5 x 2.4 m) to confine bumble bee hives to watermelon plants and compared fruit set in those cages to cages containing watermelons but no pollinators, and to open areas of field next to cages (allows all pollinators). We also collected data on single visit pollen deposition onto watermelon stigmas by managed bumble bees, honey bees, and wild bees. Overall, more fruit formed within the open cages than in cages of the other two treatment groups. B. impatiens and Melissodes spp. deposited the most pollen onto watermelon stigmas per visit, but all bee species observed visiting watermelon flowers were capable of depositing ample pollen to watermelon stigmas. Although B. impatiens did deposit large quantities of pollen to stigmas, they were not common within the field (i.e., outside the cages) as they were readily drawn to flowering plants outside of the watermelon field. Overall, bumble bees can successfully pollinate watermelon, but may be useful in greenhouses or high tunnels where watermelon flowers have no competition from other flowering plants that could draw bumble bees away from watermelon.

Fatty acid composition in native bees: Associations with thermal and feeding ecology	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Thermal ecology; Diet consumption; GC-FID; Transesterification; Proboscis-length; Linear discriminant analysis; Cluster analysis	HOMEOVISCOUS ADAPTATION; HONEY-BEES; LIPID-COMPOSITION; COLD-ACCLIMATION; MEMBRANE-LIPIDS; GUT MICROBIOTA; OLEIC-ACID; FOOD-WEB; WARM-UP; THERMOREGULATION	Fatty acid (FA) composition of lipids plays a crucial role in the functioning of lipid-containing structures in organisms and may be affected by the temperature an organism experiences, as well as its diet. We compared FA composition among four bee genera: Andrena, Bombus, Megachile, and Osmia which differ in their thermal ecology and diet. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared by direct transesterification with KOH and analyzed using gas-liquid chromatography with a flame ionization detector. Sixteen total FAs ranging in chain length from eight to 22 carbon atoms were identified. Linear discriminant analysis separated the bees based on their FA composition. Andrena was characterized by relatively high concentrations of polyunsaturated FAs, Bombus by high monounsaturated FAs and Megachilids (Megachile and Osmia) by relatively high amounts of saturated FAs. These differences in FA composition may in part be explained by variation in the diets of these bees. Because tongue (proboscis) length may be used as a proxy for the types of flowers bees may visit for nectar and pollen, we compared FA composition among Bombus that differed in proboscis length (but have similar thermal ecology). A clear separation in FA composition within Bombus with varying proboscis lengths was found using linear discriminant analysis. Further, comparing the relationship between each genus by cluster analysis revealed aggregations by genus that were not completely separated, suggesting potential overlap in dietary acquisition of FAs.

Reliable Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) diagnosis of this mandatory pest is required to limit its further spread and impact. Here, we have developed SHB primers, which amplify for 10 native African locations and 10 reported introductions, but not for three closely related species (Aethina concolor, Aethina flavicollis, and Aethina inconspicua). We also show that adult honey bee workers can be used as matrices for PCR-based detection of SHBs. The sensitivity of this novel method appears to be 100%, which is identical to conventional visual screenings. Furthermore, the specificity of this novel approach was also high (90.91%). Since both sensitivity and specificity are high, we recommend this novel PCR method and the new primers for routine surveillance of hives in high-risk areas.

Local extinction of a rare plant pollinator in Southern Utah (USA) associated with invasion by Africanized honey bees	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Endangered mutualism; Oligolectic bee; Endemic poppy; Arctomecon; Perdita	APIS-MELLIFERA L.; ENDANGERED MUTUALISMS; UNITED-STATES; NATIVE BEES; DYNAMICS; CONSERVATION; HYMENOPTERA; PAPAVERACEAE; BIODIVERSITY; INFESTATION	Twenty-five years ago, Arctomecon humilis, a pollinator-dependent, endangered poppy globally restricted to the extreme northeastern Mojave Desert in southwestern Utah, was pollinated by native bee species and the European honey bee. Follow-up studies beginning in 2012 failed to find the two most important native bee pollinator species, one of which, Perdita meconis, is a strict poppy specialist. We had four objectives: (1) confirm the status of formerly important native bee pollinators; (2) determine the role of the Africanized honey bee which reportedly invaded southern Utah in 2008; (3) examine the effect of the ostensible change in pollinator fauna on fruit set in four populations; (4) describe the pollination proficiency of species that presently visit poppy flowers. For the fourth consecutive survey, P. meconis was absent; its local extinction in Utah now seems certain. Another previously important native pollinator, Eucera quadricincta, was very rare. Also uncommon was the European honey bee, having been largely replaced by Africanized honey bees which have become, in most populations, the prevalent pollinator. Africanized bees forage early in the day and quickly strip flowers of their copious pollen leaving little for native bees. We argue that the invasion of southern Utah by Africanized bees is the most likely cause of the severe disruption of the A. humilis pollination system. The ascension of the Africanized bee is also associated with reduced fruit set in all poppy populations, especially those where plants are sparse. Arctomecon humilis now appears to depend mostly on an invasive species for pollination.

Habitat restoration benefits wild bees: A meta-analysis	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						abundance; bees; burning; conservation; grazing; habitat; land management; pollinators; restoration; species richness	FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; PRAIRIE RESTORATION; GRAZING INTENSITY; LOCAL HABITAT; NATIVE BEES; BUMBLE BEES; SEED MIXES; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION	1. Pollinator conservation is of increasing interest in the light of managed honeybee (Apis mellifera) declines, and declines in some species of wild bees. Much work has gone into understanding the effects of habitat enhancements in agricultural systems on wild bee abundance, richness and pollination services. However, the effects of ecological restoration targeting "natural" ecological endpoints (e.g. restoring former agricultural fields to historic vegetation types or improving degraded natural lands) on wild bees have received relatively little attention, despite their potential importance for countering habitat loss. 2. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of ecological restoration on wild bee abundance and richness, focusing on unmanaged bee communities in lands restored and managed to increase habitat availability and quality. Specifically, we assessed bee abundance and/or richness across studies comparing restored vs. unrestored treatments and studies investigating effects of specific habitat restoration techniques, such as burning, grazing, invasive plant removal and seeding. 3. We analysed 28 studies that met our selection criteria: these represented 11 habitat types and 7 restoration techniques. Nearly all restorations associated with these studies were performed without explicit consideration of habitat needs for bees or other pollinators. The majority of restorations targeted plant community goals, which could potentially have ancillary benefits for bees. 4. Restoration had overall positive effects on wild bee abundance and richness across multiple habitat types. Specific restoration actions, tested independently, also tended to have positive effects on wild bee richness and abundance. 5. Synthesis and applications. We found strong evidence that ecological restoration advances wild bee conservation. This is important given that habitat loss is recognized as a leading factor in pollinator decline. Pollinator responses to land management are rarely evaluated in non-agricultural settings and so support for wild bees may be an underappreciated benefit of botanically focused management. Future restoration projects that explicitly consider the needs of wild bees could be more effective at providing nesting, foraging and other habitat resources. We encourage land managers to design and evaluate restoration projects with the habitat needs of wild bee species in mind.

Supplementing small farms with native mason bees increases strawberry size and growth rate	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						agriculture; berry; cocoons; ecosystem services; growth rates; honeybees; mason bees; native pollinators; orchard bee; pollination	OSMIA-LIGNARIA HYMENOPTERA; BUMBLE BEES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; CROP YIELD; FRUIT-SET; POLLINATION; MEGACHILIDAE; POPULATIONS; LANDSCAPES; DIVERSITY	1. Pollination services, especially those of bees, play a vital role in agriculture. Declining honeybee populations require us to find alternative solutions for sustainable agriculture. Native bees are proving to be efficient pollinators. Mason bees (Osmia lignaria) provide valuable pollinator services for some woody orchard species, but their value as pollinators for herbaceous crops is largely untested. 2. We assessed the effectiveness of O. lignaria supplementation on nine strawberry farms over two growing seasons. We specifically selected mason bees for this work because they emerge from cocoons in the springtime, when few other bees are available for pollination. Cocoons are easily deployed on farms and emerged bees have a small flight radius, so they remain localized. We placed cocoons on one side of each berry farm plot (our mason bee addition treatment) but not on the opposite side (our control). We tagged and monitored berries on nine farms throughout the growing season. We performed statistical comparisons of berries from the treatment and control for differences in berry growth rate and size. In addition, we supplemented farms with native bee homes constructed from three materials (bamboo, Phragmites and wood). This allowed us to determine whether adult mason bees would produce a subsequent generation of bees on farms and whether the bees had a preference for nest material type. 3. Our work demonstrates that mason bees can be used successfully to pollinate herbaceous berry crops. We found that berry growth rate was significantly higher and berry volume was significantly larger for berries from the treatment relative to the control. We also found that adult bees successfully utilized the bee homes for laying the next generation of offspring and that bees colonized bamboo homes more than other home types. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results are the first to show that native mason bees (Osmia lignaria) can be used successfully to provide pollination services on strawberry farms. Their use results in the production of bigger berries and faster berry growth rates than managed honeybees alone. Mason bees overwinter (and can be purchased) in cocoons, offering great potential for efficient and effective pollination services, for a variety of agricultural applications across different geographical regions. The availability of suitable nesting sites and protection of subsequent generations of cocoons from wasp parasitization warrant future consideration.

Synergistic interactions between a variety of insecticides and an ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor fungicide in dietary exposures of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.)	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						bumble bees; ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor fungicide; insecticides; synergy	APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; NEONICOTINOIDS; CROPS; POLLEN; CONSERVATION; POLLINATORS; METABOLISM; MECHANISM; TOXICITY	BACKGROUND: In recent years, concern has been raised over honey bee colony losses, and also among wild bees there is evidence for extinctions and range contractions in Europe and North America. Pesticides have been proposed as a potential cause of this decline. Bees are exposed simultaneously to a variety of agrochemicals, which may cause synergistically detrimental impacts, which are incompletely understood. We investigated the toxicity of the fungicide imazalil in mixture with four common insecticides: fipronil (phenylpyrazoid), cypermethrin (pyrethroid), thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid (neonicotinoids). Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor (EBI) fungicides like imazalil can inhibit P450 detoxification systems in insects and therefore fungicide - insecticide co-occurrence might produce synergistic toxicity in bees. We assessed the impact of dietary fungicide - insecticide mixtures on the mortality and feeding rates of laboratory bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.). RESULTS: Regarding mortality, imazalil synergised the toxicity of fipronil, cypermethrin and thiamethoxam, but not imidacloprid. We found no synergistic effects on feeding rates. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that P450-based detoxification processes are differentially important in mitigating the toxicity of certain insecticides, even those of the same chemical class. Our evidence that cocktail effects can arise in bumble bees should extend concern about the potential impacts of agrochemical mixtures to include wild bee species in farmland.

J	Simons, MA; Smith, AR				Simons, Meagan A.; Smith, Adam R.			Ovary activation does not correlate with pollen and nectar foraging specialization in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens	PEERJ			English	Article						Division of labor; Foraging specialization; Reproductive ground plan hypothesis	DIVISION-OF-LABOR; REPRODUCTIVE GROUND-PLAN; SOCIAL COMPLEXITY; COLONY SIZE; BEHAVIOR; HYMENOPTERA; EVOLUTION; INSECT; COMPETITION; FLOWERS	Social insect foragers may specialize on certain resource types. Specialization on pollen or nectar among honeybee foragers is hypothesized to result from associations between reproductive physiology and sensory tuning that evolved in ancestral solitary bees (the Reproductive Ground-Plan Flypothesis; RGPH). However, the two non-honeybee species studied showed no association between specialization and ovary activation. Here we investigate the bumblebee B. impatiens because it has the most extensively studied pollen/nectar specialization of any bumblebee. We show that ovary size does not differ between pollen specialist, nectar specialist, and generalist foragers, contrary to the predictions of the RGPH. However, we also found mixed support for the second prediction of the RGPH, that sensory sensitivity, measured through proboscis extension response (PER), is greater among pollen foragers. We also found a correlation between foraging activity and ovary size, and foraging activity and relative nectar preference, but no correlation between ovary size and nectar preference. In one colony non-foragers had larger ovaries than foragers, supporting the reproductive conflict and work hypothesis, but in the other colony they did not.

High configurational landscape heterogeneity due to small fields and a high amount of field boundaries is hypothesized to enhance farmland biodiversity. Here, we investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming in large- vs. small-scale agricultural landscapes on wild bee communities and their floral resources to improve conservation schemes for pollinators. We sampled bees in Central Germany at the field boundaries of 18 pairs of conventionally and organically managed winter wheat fields along the former iron curtain using pan traps and trap nests. Around traps, we surveyed species richness and flower cover of insect-pollinated forbs. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming was related to higher insect-pollinated forb species richness and flower cover in the field boundaries, presumably due to the lack of herbicide use. Interestingly, small-scale agriculture did not counteract the loss of floral resources under conventional management, as the difference to organic management was even larger in Western small-scale agriculture. Organic farming, but not small-scale agriculture, enhanced species richness of solitary bees, which is in line with their small home ranges. In contrast, bumblebees benefitted only from small-scale agriculture, which matches with their high dispersal ability. Despite similar levels of abundance and diversity of trap-nesting bees in the two landscape types, brood cell parasitism was also higher in small-scale agriculture. Both organic farming and small-scale agriculture directly and indirectly supported different groups of wild bees, suggesting long-term benefits for conservation. Agri environment schemes should acknowledge the so far neglected benefits of small-scale agriculture for biodiversity and its potential services.

Study of the Metatranscriptome of Eight Social and Solitary Wild Bee Species Reveals Novel Viruses and Bee Parasites	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Bombus; Osmia; Andrena; viruses; bee parasites; metatranscriptomics	LENGTH SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; SP N. MICROSPORIDIA; MACULA-LIKE VIRUS; RNA-SEQ; GENOME; ALIGNMENT; BUMBLEBEES; EVOLUTION; BOMBUS; TUBULINOSEMATIDAE	Bees are associated with a remarkable diversity of microorganisms, including unicellular parasites, bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The application of next-generation sequencing approaches enables the identification of this rich species composition as well as the discovery of previously unknown associations. Using high-throughput polyadenylated ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, we investigated the metatranscriptome of eight wild bee species (Andrena cineraria, Andrena fulva, Andrena haemorrhoa, Bombus terrestris, Bombus cryptarum, Bombus pascuorum, Osmia bicomis, and Osmia comuta) sampled from four different localities in Belgium. Across the RNA sequencing libraries, 88-99% of the taxonomically informative reads were of the host transcriptome. Four viruses with homology to insect pathogens were found including two RNA viruses (belonging to the families Iflaviridae and Tymoviridae that harbor already viruses of honey bees), a double stranded DNA virus (family Nudiviridae) and a single stranded DNA virus (family Parvoviridae). In addition, we found genomic sequences of 11 unclassified arthropod viruses (related to negeviruses, sobemoviruses, totiviruses, rhabdoviruses, and mononegaviruses), seven plant pathogenic viruses, and one fungal virus. Interestingly, nege-like viruses appear to be widespread, host-specific, and capable of attaining high copy numbers inside bees. Next to viruses, three novel parasite associations were discovered in wild bees, including Crithidia pragensis and a tubulinosematid and a neogregarine parasite. Yeasts of the genus Metschnikowia were identified in solitary bees. This study gives a glimpse of the microorganisms and viruses associated with social and solitary wild bees and demonstrates that their diversity exceeds by far the subset of species first discovered in honey bees.

Specialty oilseed crops provide an abundant source of pollen for pollinators and beneficial insects	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Agroecology; Apis mellifera L; cover crops; hymenoptera; natural enemies; nutrition	MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER; HONEY-BEE; NECTAR PRODUCTION; SOLITARY BEES; MAIZE; CORN; CONSERVATION; PENNYCRESS; CULTIVARS	The continuing pollinator crisis is due, in part, to the lack of year-round floral resources. In intensive farming regions, such as the Upper Midwest (UMW) of the USA, natural and pastoral vegetation largely has been replaced by annual crops such as maize (Zea mays L.), soyabean (Glycine max L.) and wheat (Triticum spp.). Neither the energy (nectar) nor protein (pollen) needs of pollinating and other beneficial insects are being met sufficiently by the new, high-intensity, agricultural landscape. Several potentially useful oilseed crops can be grown in the UMW, and many of these oilseeds are highly attractive to beneficial insects. Prior research showed that some of these oilseeds produced abundant nectar, but their corresponding values for pollen production are unknown. Accordingly, the aim of our research was to document pollen (and protein) production per unit area of twelve oilseed crops grown in Minnesota and associate these values with levels of beneficial insect visitation during anthesis. Our results show that oilseed crops such as camelina (Camelina sativa L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) produce relatively little pollen (40kg/ha); borage (Borago officinalis L.), calendula (Calendula officinalis L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), crambe (Crambe abyssianica Hochst) and cuphea (Cuphea viscosissima Jacq. x Cuphea lanceolata W. T. Aiton) produce bountiful pollen resources (50-150kg/ha); and oilseed echium (Echium plantagineum L.) generates massive amounts of pollen (>400kg/ha), about 50% of which is protein. Our study is unique in presenting a season-long perspective of pollen production in alternative oilseed crops, a resource valuable to pollen-feeding insects such as managed and wild bees. Diversification of UMW landscapes that includes alternative oilseed crops such as oilseed echium and cuphea can potentially provide a ready source of pollen and protein to help combat pollinator decline.

Ecology and Economics of Using Native Managed Bees for Almond Pollination	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						blue orchard bee; Osmia lignaria; cost-benefit analysis; foraging density; net benefit	OSMIA-LIGNARIA HYMENOPTERA; IMPACTS; YIELDS	Native managed bees can improve crop pollination, but a general framework for evaluating the associated economic costs and benefits has not been developed. We conducted a cost-benefit analysis to assess how managing blue orchard bees (Osmia lignaria Say [Hymenoptera: Megachildae]) alongside honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) can affect profits for almond growers in California. Specifically, we studied how adjusting three strategies can influence profits: (1) number of released O. lignaria bees, (2) density of artificial nest boxes, and (3) number of nest cavities (tubes) per box. We developed an ecological model for the effects of pollinator activity on almond yields, validated the model with published data, and then estimated changes in profits for different management strategies. Our model shows that almond yields increase with O. lignaria foraging density, even where honey bees are already in use. Our cost-benefit analysis shows that profit ranged from -US$1,800 to US$2,800/acre given different combinations of the three strategies. Adding nest boxes had the greatest effect; we predict an increase in profit between low and high nest box density strategies (2.5 and 10 boxes/acre). In fact, the number of released bees and the availability of nest tubes had relatively small effects in the high nest box density strategies. This suggests that growers could improve profits by simply adding more nest boxes with moderate number of tubes in each. Our approach can support grower decisions regarding integrated crop pollination and highlight the importance of a comprehensive ecological economic framework for assessing these decisions.

J	Wu-Smart, J; Spivak, M				Wu-Smart, Judy; Spivak, Marla			Effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid exposure on bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) queen survival and nest initiation	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						bumble bees; systemic insecticide exposure; nontarget risk	PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; HONEY-BEES; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; CROP POLLINATION; POLLEN; INSECT; FIELD; THIAMETHOXAM; BIODIVERSITY; TOXICITY	Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects and may systemically translocate to nectar and pollen of plants where foraging bees may become exposed. Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests.

The Effects of an Ultra-low-Volume Application of Etofenprox for Mosquito Management on Megachile rotundata (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) Larvae and Adults in an Agricultural Setting	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						risk assessment; pollination; mosquito control; agricultural entomology	ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE; PYRETHROID INSECTICIDES; SOLITARY BEE; MALATHION; PERMETHRIN; SURVIVAL	The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F. (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), is one of the most intensively managed solitary bees and greatly contributes to alfalfa production in both the United States and Canada. Although production of certain commodities, especially alfalfa seed, has become increasingly dependent on this species' pollination proficiency, little information is known about how M. rotundata is affected by insecticide exposure. To better understand the risk posed to M. rotundata by the increasing use of insecticides to manage mosquitoes, we conducted field experiments that directly exposed M. rotundata nests, adults, and larvae to a pyrethroid insecticide via a ground-based ultra-low-volume (ULV) aerosol generator. We directly targeted nest shelters with Zenivex (R) E20 (etofenprox) at a half-maximum rate of 0.0032 kg/ha at dusk and then observed larval mortality, adult mortality, and the total number of completed nests for both the treated and control groups. There was no significant difference in the proportion of dead (P = 0.99) and alive (P = 0.23) larvae when the control group was compared with the treated group. We also did not observe a significant difference in the number of emerged adults reared from the treated shelters (P = 0.22 and 0.50 for females and males, respectively), and the number of completed cells after exposure to the insecticides continued to increase throughout the summer, indicating that provisioning adults were not affected by the insecticide treatment. The results from this study suggest that the amount of insecticide reaching nest shelters may not be sufficient to cause significant mortality.

This was the first European record of this species that is native to East Asia. To our knowledge, it is the first introduced bee species in Europe. Here, we provide an overview of the current distribution of M.sculpturalis in France and we describe the history of its range expansion. Besides our own observations, information was compiled from literature and Internet websites, and by contacting naturalist networks. We collected a total of 117 records (localityxyear combinations) for the 2008-2016 period. The geographical range of M.sculpturalis has extended remarkably, now occupying a third of continental France, with the most northern and western records located 335 and 520km from Allauch, respectively. Information on its phenology, feeding, and nesting behavior is also provided. We report several events of nest occupation or eviction of Osmia sp. and Xylocopa sp. individuals by M.sculpturalis. Our results show that M.sculpturalis is now well established in France. Given its capacity to adapt and rapidly expand its range, we recommend amplifying the monitoring of this species to better anticipate the changes in its geographical range and its potential impacts on native bees.

Detection of honey bee viruses in Argentinian stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Meliponini; Apiformes; Health; Virus; Misiones province	DEFORMED WING VIRUS; PARALYSIS VIRUS; 1ST DETECTION; AMERICA; FLIES	The Meliponini is a eusocial group of bees tropically distributed. In Argentina, 37 species have been recorded, mostly in Misiones province. They use a great variety of sites to build their nests including tree hollows, cavities formed in rocks, human constructions or underground spaces. Numerous natural enemies are associated with stingless bees, including viruses. Until now, some viruses present in honey bees and related to the colony collapse disorder (CCD), have been found in several wild bees around the world. Here, we have studied the presence of honey bee viruses in stingless bees from different locations of Misiones province, Argentina. On this research, 73 samples of ten workers belonging to 12 species of stingless bees and feral honey bees, have been analyzed. Our results confirm the presence of three viruses: ABPV, IAPV and DWV Type A in four species of stingless bees and feral honey bees. More studies are required to establish if ABPV, IAPV and DWV are natural pathogens of stingless bees that have been spilled over to honey bees, or were transmitted by Apis mellifera to stingless bees.

J	Lassen, KM; Nielsen, LR; Lompo, D; Dupont, YL; Kjaer, ED				Lassen, Kristin Marie; Nielsen, Lene Rostgaard; Lompo, Djingdia; Dupont, Yoko Luise; Kjaer, Erik Dahl			Honey bees are essential for pollination of Vitellaria paradoxa subsp paradoxa (Sapotaceae) in Burkina Faso	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Agroforestry parklands; Honey bees; Pollination; Solitary bees; Stingless bees; Vitellaria paradoxa	APIS-MELLIFERA; STINGLESS BEES; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; PLANT; SIZE; RESOURCE; TREE; ENVIRONMENT; SELECTION; SYSTEM	Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) is an important fruit tree in West African parklands, and its successful pollination is a requirement for fruit production. Size-based pollinator exclusion experiments combined with visual observations showed that presence of honey bees (Apis mellifera jemenitica) was important for pollination and thereby the production of fruits and seeds. Smaller insects, mainly species of stingless bees (Hypotrigona spp. and Liotrigona cf. bottegoi) and solitary bees (Compsomelissa borneri) could partly compensate pollination in absence of honey bees, but fertilisation and fruit yield was reduced. A positive correlation between fertilisation percentage and number of honey bee colonies within radii of 900 and 1000 m was observed. The percentage of fertilisation and number of mature fruits per fascicle were higher in trees with colonies of stingless bees in the trunk when honey bees were excluded by bagging. We conclude that local beekeeping with honey bees and stingless bees is likely to have a positive influence on fruit production of shea trees in the farmed West African parklands, which speaks in favour of a pollinator friendly environment.

Effects of landscape cover and local habitat characteristics on visiting bees in tropical orchards	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bee abundance; bee richness; field size; flowering plants; land cover; south-east Asia; urbanization	NATIVE BEES; WILD BEES; CROP POLLINATION; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; FORAGING RANGES; FIELD MARGINS; FRUIT-SET; DIVERSITY; SCALE; HYMENOPTERA	1 Global population declines of insect pollinators highlight the need for a greater ecological understanding of the responses of wild pollinators to local management actions and to human alterations of landscapes, especially in the tropics where crops are highly dependent on wild pollinators. 2 We examined the effects of local and landscape factors on the richness and abundance of bees in farms around Bangkok, Thailand. Bee communities in 24 mango (Mangifera indica L.) orchards in heavily modified landscapes (61-99% anthropogenic land cover) were compared. We predicted that bees would be more species rich in orchards with higher flower diversity, whereas small-sized bees with non-eusocial and/or below-ground nesting habits would be more sensitive to human disturbance, and hence rare. 3 Twenty-eight species were caught and individuals of genus Apis comprised >92% of 3842 bees sampled and dominated all 24 sites. 4 Habitat effects on bee richness and abundance were stronger at the farm scale than at the landscape scale. At the farm scale, total bee richness and abundance, as well as small, non-eusocial and below-ground nesting bee richness and abundance, were negatively associated with field size and positively associated with flowering plant diversity. The percentage of urban land cover within a 1-km radius was weakly but positively related to total bee richness and small-sized bee richness; total bee abundance was positively associated with wetland cover. 5 A greater diversity of flowering plants retained in smaller fields maintained higher bee richness and abundances, particularly small-sized bees. Farmers can enhance bee populations by maintaining small patches of flowers in their fields.

J	Svanberg, I; Berggren, A				Svanberg, Ingvar; Berggren, Asa			Bumblebee Honey in the Nordic Countries	ETHNOBIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Foraging; Insect products; Historical ethnobiology; Wild foods; Entomophagy	FOOD	Research in historical ethnobiology can provide information about little known and seemingly insignificant practices in the past. The utilization of insect products as a foodstuff is a rare custom in Europe and data on this practice are scarce. From Nordic countries, we have information about producing ant schnapps with the help of the red wood ant, Formica rufa L., which has been used both as a remedy and as a drink. Honey and beeswax were once gathered in the forests from wild honey bee colonies, but have been replaced with products from the domestic honey bee, Apis mellifera L. Another product, once a well-known and appreciated sweet, especially among children, was nectar gathered from bumblebee nests. Collecting the nectar from bumblebee nests is an activity that has been practiced within living memory in many parts of the Nordic countries. This seems to be an ancient practice dating back at least a millennium that has survived until recently. It is an example of how methods and sources established within historical ethnobiology can be used to gain knowledge on the past as well as possible future uses of available biological resources.

The Eastern honeybee (Apis cerana) is more resistant to several pathogens than the Western honeybee (Apis mellifera), and the genomes of two strains of the nominotypical subspecies, A. cerana cerana, northern (Korea) and southern (China) strains, have been sequenced. Apis cerana japonica, another subspecies of A. cerana, shows many specific features (e.g. mildness, low honey production and frequently absconds) and it is important to study the molecular biological and genetic aspects of these features. To accelerate the genetic research on A. cerana japonica, we sequenced the genome of this subspecies. The draft genome sequence of A. cerana japonica presented here is of high quality in terms of basic genome status (e.g. N50 is 180 kbp, total length is 211 Mbp, and largest contig length is 1.31 Mbp) and BUSCO results. The gene set of A. cerana japonica was predicted using AUGUSTUS software and the set of genes was annotated using Blastp and InterProScan, and GO terms were added to each gene. The number of genes is higher than in A. mellifera and in the two strains of A. cerana cerana sequenced previously. A small number of transposable elements and repetitive regions were found in A. cerana japonica, which are also in the genomes of A. mellifera and the northern and southern strains of A. cerana cerana. Apis cerana is resistant to several pathogens that seriously damage A. mellifera. We searched for 41 orthologs related to the IMD and Toll pathways, which have key roles in the immune reaction to invading pathogens. Some orthologs were not identified in the genome of the northern strain of A. cerana cerana. This indicates that the Toll and IMD pathways function in the same way as in A. mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster. Use of the draft genome sequence of A. cerana japonica provided herein and those of the other Apis (sub)species may help to accelerate comparative research on the genome of honey bees.

In this study we present the anatomy of female and male reproductive systems of this species as well as its gonadal structure and gametogenesis at the ultrastructural level. The reproductive systems are similar to those of other Astigmata. The ovaries are paired and each contains germ-line cells - a giant nutritive ovarian cell connected via funnel-type intercellular bridges to oogonia and previtellogenic oocytes. Germinal cells are embedded in several large somatic stroma cells. Numerous protrusions of the nutritive ovarian cell penetrate into the stroma cell cytoplasm. Conspicuous ER cisterns run close and parallel to the surface of the germinal cells. Oocytes entering vitellogenesis disassociate with the nutritive cell and a vitelline envelope composed of heterogeneous material appears on their surface. When vitellogenesis is completed, the oocytes are full of lipid droplets and two types of yolk spheres; the vitelline envelope transforms into a thin and homogeneous chorion. Paired testes are located on one side of the body, whereas the opposite side is filled by a male accessory gland. In testis, germinal cells are embedded in a few somatic stroma cells. The earliest spermatogonia form a compact germarium, whereas later stages are dispersed randomly within the testis. Spermatocytes are characterized by a superficial spongy layer, formation of mitochondrial derivatives, loss of the nuclear envelope and condensation of chromatin in threads. A single electron-dense lamella appears during the spermatid stage, separating chromatin threads from a large spongy body surrounded by arcuate. double-membrane bounded cisterns. In spermatids. the superficial spongy layer is absent. The testicular central cell in the germarium and structures related to meiotic division were not observed in the testes. Spermatozoa arc multiform cells (approx. 4 x 11 mu m) containing electron-dense lamella (ca. 45 nm thick) surrounded by mitochondrial derivatives which separate chromatin threads 45-50 run thick from remnants of the spongy body i.e. arcuate cistern profiles. Spermatozoa deposited in female spermatheca are more electron dense; the electron-dense lamella is deeply folded several times, whereas chromatin threads are present in the center of the spermatozoon and are either flanked by lamella folds or located more peripherally under the plasmalemma. Remnants of the spongy body are not discernible.

It combines the use of managed and wild pollinators in a location-specific manner. The honeybee is our best known ally and an essential part of ICP. Here we highlight two main aspects of the honeybee's biology and use some anthropomorphism elements to explain our point of view. The first is on social behaviour, the shift from single mating towards a promiscuous lifestyle was essential to develop full eusociality. This also means that some half sisters are stuck in a social framework and raise fertile offspring, while having low kinship with them. Second, a queen develops a large workforce of bees, with a division of labour. Aside from nursing and foraging, also time is allocated towards defence. We question if more assertive strategies are present. We speculate on a workforce carrying parasites, to perform parasite-mediated competition with other, yet solitary, bees. We discuss two mechanisms: (i) where social immunity tempers the effect of a specific parasite in a social bee; (ii) current domestication practises could also facilitate parasite-mediated competition in both directions.

Therefore, taking action to protect and assess the impact of pesticides on these insects is fully justified. Pesticides may cause mortality and also sub-lethal effects that are not always directly visible. Bumblebees, like honeybees, can be used as indicators for environmental monitoring contamination. Two approaches are mainly used for the determination of pesticide residues in pollinating insects: a toxicological test (to know effects) and multi-stage analytical methodologies (to know exposure). The development of new analytical procedures that would use of sample preparation techniques meeting the requirements of green chemistry or the improvement of existing analytical methods; this is a challenge for analytical chemists. However, such activities can be helpful in developing legal norms regarding the maximum residue levels of pesticides in wild bee organisms.

This decline is expected to continue with climate change as the main driver. However, at the local scale, land use and land cover (LULC) change strongly affects the occurrence of bumblebees. At present, LULC change is rarely included in models of future distributions of species. This study's objective is to compare the roles of dynamic LULC change and climate change on the projected distribution patterns of 48 European bumblebee species for three change scenarios until 2100 at the scales of Europe, and Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg (BENELUX). We compared three types of models: (1) only climate covariates, (2) climate and static LULC covariates and (3) climate and dynamic LULC covariates. The climate and LULC change scenarios used in the models include, extreme growth applied strategy (GRAS), business as might be usual and sustainable European development goals. We analysed model performance, range gain/loss and the shift in range limits for all bumblebees. Overall, model performance improved with the introduction of LULC covariates. Dynamic models projected less range loss and gain than climate-only projections, and greater range loss and gain than static models. Overall, there is considerable variation in species responses and effects were most pronounced at the BENELUX scale. The majority of species were predicted to lose considerable range, particularly under the extreme growth scenario (GRAS; overall mean: 64% +/- 34). Model simulations project a number of local extinctions and considerable range loss at the BENELUX scale (overall mean: 56% +/- 39). Therefore, we recommend species-specific modelling to understand how LULC and climate interact in future modelling.

J	Araujo, LS; Medina, AM; Gimenes, M				Araujo, Laene S.; Medina, Anderson M.; Gimenes, Miriam			Pollination efficiency on Ipomoea bahiensis (Convolvulaceae): morphological and behavioural aspects of floral visitors	IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA			English	Article						Apis mellifera; Melitoma; Pseudaugochlora pandora; Bee-flower interaction	BREEDING SYSTEM; BEES; PATTERNS	Pollination depends on morphological and behavioural adjustments between visitors and plants. Some plant species as Ipomoea bahiensis (Convolvulaceae) provide nectar and pollen to visitors and occur in anthropic areas, therefore becoming an important source of resources for the maintenance of native pollinating insects. However, what is the efficiency of each floral visitor species for the pollination of this plant species? What morphological and behavioural characteristics determine the pollinators? In this regard, this study evaluated the I. bahiensis flower and visitor morphology in a semi-arid area and the foraging behaviour of these floral visitors. Also, the efficiency rate of potential pollinators was quantified. Bees and butterflies visited the flowers of I. bahiensis, but the bees Melitoma spp., Apis mellifera (Linnaeus, 1758), and Pseudaugochlora pandora (Smith, 1853) were the most frequent visitors. These species presented medium-sized and compatible with the floral tube width. In addition to the size, these bees presented behaviour that favoured the contact with the reproductive structures of the flower, as evidenced by the efficiency test of the flower visits. Although butterflies often collect nectar from the flowers, they do not present characteristics that could result in pollination. Hence, medium-sized bees played the role of efficient pollinator of I. bahiensis.

We compared the forage floral diversity of three types of lowland meadows (Molinia meadows, tall herb fringe meadows, and hay meadows) located in south eastern Poland. The total number of plant species was 125, including 84 species (67.2%) classified as plants visited by insects. The richness and diversity of forage flora differed between the types of meadow. The Molinia meadows and hay meadows were preferred by pollinators. However, different taxonomic groups of pollinators can respond to the variability and availability of floral resources in a different way. Molinia meadows are of particular importance for the abundance of Bombus spp., solitary bees, and flies. The RDA ordination model demonstrated that the floral community composition, plant species abundance, plant species richness, and floral attributes (size, shape, phenology) were all important for the abundance of insect visitors in the mosaic of meadows. The cluster analysis showed that most plant species were visited by similar groups of insects; however, their proportion differed considerably. Our results present arguments for inclusion of semi-natural meadows into conservation plans and for efforts of protection of highly effective floral resources aimed at maintenance of pollinators.

These four and other available mt genome sequences of Apis were used to scrutinize the within-genus genomic characteristics, gene arrangement, and phylogenetic relationships of Apis. Furthermore, phylogenetic performance of 15 individual genes and two concatenated gene combinations were tested to locate suitable genes for Apis phylogeny. Phylogenetic reconstruction using all concatenated protein-coding genes (PCGs) and rRNAs strongly supported the presence of three lineages in Apis: the sister lineages of cavity-nesting honey bees (A. cerana, A. mellifera, A. nigrocincta, and A. koschevnikovi) and the giant honey bees (A. dorsata and A. laboriosa), and a divergent lineage consisting of the dwarf honey bees (A. florea and A. andreniformis). Apis mt genomes revealed two gene arrangements, trnE-trnS(1) or trnS(1)-trnE in the tRNA block at the A+T-rich region and ND2 junction. The gene arrangement found in Apis are consistent with two independent derivations because the same arrangement was shared between non-sister species.

Alice; Soland-Reckeweg, Gabriele; Neuditschko, Markus			Empirical comparison of microsatellite and SNP markers to estimate introgression in Apis mellifera mellifera	JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Apis mellifera mellifera; introgression; microsatellites; SNPs; conservation	POPULATIONS	The genetic identity of the dark European honey bee, Apis mellifera mellifera is currently under pressure throughout most of its native range due to large scale commercial trade and replacement with honey bees of mainly Eastern European ancestry (C-lineage: Apis mellifera carnica and Apis mellifera ligustica). To counteract this process, numerous conservation efforts for the protection of native honey bees are sprouting across Europe. For the management of such protected areas and conservation breeding purposes, honey bee subspecies have been routinely identified through wing morphology and through DNA-hybrid tests using microsatellite markers. Currently, new methods are evolving including rapid innovations in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology and high-throughput sequencing. Here, we aim to quantify potential marker-specific biases of hybrid tests and give recommendations for applications in honey bee conservation management. Using an empirical dataset, we first assessed the accuracy of a recently developed reduced SNP panel to estimate C-lineage introgression in A. m. mellifera compared to whole-genome sequence (WGS) data. Using another independent data set, we estimated the differences in admixture proportions between the currently applied hybrid test based on microsatellites and the novel SNP test. We demonstrate that the SNP-based test which contains highly ancestry-informative markers is very efficient to estimate genome-wide ancestry. Furthermore, we report discrepancies between microsatellite and SNP-based admixture proportions. For conservation management, we, therefore, recommend the implementation of SNP-based hybrid tests to maintain high genetic variation within the breeding population, while minimizing influence of introduced honey bees.

Risks to pollinators and pollination from invasive alien species	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Review							HONEY-BEE; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; POLLEN DEPOSITION; BUMBLE BEE; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; EUROPEAN BUMBLEBEE; INTRODUCED BEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; NATIVE PLANTS; WILD BEES	Invasive alien species modify pollinator biodiversity and the services they provide that underpin ecosystem function and human well-being. Building on the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) global assessment of pollinators and pollination, we synthesize current understanding of invasive alien impacts on pollinators and pollination. Invasive alien species create risks and opportunities for pollinator nutrition, re-organize species interactions to affect native pollination and community stability, and spread and select for virulent diseases. Risks are complex but substantial, and depend greatly on the ecological function and evolutionary history of both the invader and the recipient ecosystem. We highlight evolutionary implications for pollination from invasive alien species, and identify future research directions, key messages and options for decision-making.

The aim of this study was to obtain information about the pollination services used in the municipalities of Vacaria-RS e Sao Joaquim-SC, the main apple-producing regions in Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with apple growers and technicians responsible for the orchards during 2013 and 2015. The obtained information was: a) cropping systems; b) use of pollination services; c) number of hives per hectare during flowering; d) renting value of hives; e) mortality of colonies; f) agrochemicals used on flowering; g) presence of native bees on flowering. In Vacaria and Sao Joaquim, respectively, 70% and 68.6% of the apple growers use the integrated apple production as their production model. The directed pollination is used by 100% and 90.0% of respondents respectively, from which, 80% and 47.1% opt for the hive rent. On average, three hives were used per hectare in both regions. The average cost is U$ 17.52 and U$ 17.74 per hive, respectively. During the flowering period, insecticides and fungicides are used by 100% and 97.2% of the apple growers. The highest mean percentage of mortality of colonies during flowering was reported in Vacaria, 11.8%. Native bees are often found in apple flowers. The development of management strategies for the conservation of domestic and wild pollinators is essential.

Literature suggests acquiring local ecological knowledge on these species is a formidable barrier. The present study uses interview data to explore farmers' acquisition of local ecological knowledge concerning wild bees, as well as farmers' use and conservation of wild bees. Wild bees are important crop pollinators and an alternative or supplement to declining commercial honeybees. We found that high uncertainty over wild bees prompts risk aversion, slowing use and conservation. However, to acquire local ecological knowledge, farmers eschew time-consuming assessment and instead develop rules of thumb that mesh with and draw on their use of honeybees. These findings illustrate the complex way in which farmers adapt to the challenge of acquiring local ecological knowledge of functional agrobiodiversity in a conventional agricultural system.

In this study, we assessed the genetic variation and population structure of A. cerana using the mitochondrial sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI). We collected samples from 11 provinces of China and also included previously-collected data from two provinces of southern China. A total of 1,518 sequences with a length of 760 bp in 51 A. cerana populations were analyzed. We found 111 haplotypes within these sequences, of which 78 haplotypes were newly-defined in this study. The star-like median-joining network revealed that the haplotypes found in this study were monophyletic. A large difference in genetic diversity was found, including a gradual decrease from southern to northern populations. The southern populations harbored most of the genetic diversity and should therefore be protected. We also found a significant genetic structure among the studied populations, and defined five populations as key conservation populations. These results could be valuable in making management and conservation strategies, and for a better understanding of the evolutionary history of A. cerana populations in China.

In Japan, B. terrestris is categorized as an invasive alien species, and the use of the bee is restricted. In this study, we identify the native bumble bee Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis as a candidate commercial pollinator in Hokkaido Island. To evaluate the risk of disturbing the natural genetic structure if this bee is used as a commercial pollinator, we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship of B. h. sapporoensis in Hokkaido Island and the Asian continent. In addition, we analyzed six microsatellites to further investigate the population genetic structure in Hokkaido Island. The mitochondrial analyses revealed that there is little differentiation within Hokkaido Island; however, there is considerable differentiation between Hokkaido and the Asian continent. Microsatellite analyses using STRUCTURE showed that B. h. sapporoensis in Hokkaido was divided into two genetic groups. Individuals belonging to each group were distributed throughout Hokkaido Island, and no clear geographical differentiation was observed. These results indicate that there would be little risk of genetic disturbance if bees from Hokkaido Island were used. However, it would be advisable to avoid importing continental bees as a pollinating insect in Hokkaido Island. El abejorro europeo, Bombus terrestris, es un polinizador comercial excelente. En Japon, B. terrestris esta categorizado como una especie invasora, y su uso esta restringido. En este estudio, identificamos el abejorro nativo Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis como un candidato de polinizador comercial en la isla Hokkaido. Para evaluar el riesgo de perturbacion de la estructura genetica si este abejorro se usa como polinizador comercial, secuenciamos el gen de la subunidad I de citocromo oxidasa mitocondrial (COI) para elucidar la relacion filogenetica de B. h. sapporoensis en la isla de Hokkaido y en el continente asiatico. Ademas, analizamos seis microsatelites para investigar la estructura genetica poblacional en la isla de Hokkaido. Los analisis mitocondriales revelaron que hay poca diferenciacion en la isla de Hokkaido; sin embargo, hay una diferenciacion considerable entre Hokkaido y el continente asiatico. Los analisis de microsatelites con STRUCTURE mostraron una division de B. h. sapporoensis de Hokkaido en dos grupos geneticos. Los individuos pertenecientes a cada grupo se distribuian por toda la isla de Hokkaido, y no se observo una clara diferenciacion geografica. Estos resultados indican que habria poco riesgo de perturbacion genetica si se usaran los abejorros de la isla de Hokkaido. Sin embargo, seria aconsejable evitar la importacion de abejorros continentales como insecto polinizador en la isla de Hokkaido.

Most plantations are open fields and do not use pollination strategies to improve the production quality. Pollination with bumblebees improves the quality of the fruits, although these are produced by spontaneous pollination. The native species Bombus atratus has been recognized as an efficient pollinator of Colombian horticultural crops under greenhouse. The present study evaluated the pollination efficiency of two orphan colonies in the quality of the fruits of the "Camino real" and "Ventana" cultivars planted under a greenhouse in Cajica-Colombia. The buttons were excluded to obtain the fruits produced spontaneously and to be compared with the fruits coming from the visit of workers of B. atratus. It was found that the visit of the workers improved fruit quality in the features: caliber (35 % and 31 %), length (28 % and 19 %), fresh weight (103 % and 90 %), dry weight 126 % and 145 %) and number of seeds (55 % and 81 %) for the cultivar "Camino Real" and "Ventana" respectively. From the observations made, it was determined that the floral resource used by the workers of B. atratus was the nectar and recommendations are done about on its use in this crop.

These sites may represent an opportunity for pollinator conservation if they provide valuable foraging habitat for wild bees. To determine site characteristics that influence bee success on reclamation lands, we monitored growth and reproduction of 24 commercially reared bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies placed on 12 former coal mines (aged 2 to 30+ years post-reclamation) in Ohio, U.S.A. Twenty colonies survived the duration of the experiment (May-August 2014). All colonies produced both new queens (mean 21.0 +/- 37.0 SD) and males (36.5 +/- 36.5), in proportion to overall colony size. Results of generalized linear models indicate that colony growth and reproduction increased with floral diversity and species turnover, and declined with site area and the proportion of forest in the surrounding landscape. The sex ratio of reproductive offspring was significantly more male-biased on sites with low flower diversity, underscoring the importance of floral diversity for meeting the higher resource demands of queen production. Floral resource composition and consistency were influenced by site age and surrounding landscape. Older sites had higher floral diversity and species turnover throughout the season than younger sites, and included high-quality native bee forage plants. We discuss the implications of this study for reclamation project managers seeking to promote bee reproduction and conservation.

A novel protocol for studying bee cognition in the wild	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Apis; behaviour; Bombus; bumblebee; cognition; field; honeybee	PROBOSCIS EXTENSION; COLOR DISCRIMINATION; SPATIAL MEMORY; LEARNING SPEED; BUMBLEBEE; ODOR; PREFERENCES; PERFORMANCE; HONEYBEES; STRENGTH	Understanding how animals perceive, learn and remember stimuli is critical for understanding both how cognition is shaped by natural selection, and how ecological factors impact behaviour. However, the majority of studies on cognition involve captive animals in laboratory settings. While controlled settings are required to accurately measure aspects of cognition, they may not yield realistic estimates of learning performance in natural environments. Wild bees offer a useful system in which to study cognitive ecology and comparative cognition more broadly: they encompass around 20,000 species globally, varying in characteristics such as life-history strategy, degree of sociality and dietary specialization. Yet, the limited number of protocols currently available for studying insect cognition has restricted research to a few commercially available bee species, in almost exclusively laboratory settings. We present a protocol (Free-Moving Proboscis Extension Response [FMPER]) to measure wild bees' colour preferences, learning performance and memory. We first used laboratory-reared bumblebees Bombus impatiens to establish that FMPER yielded results consistent with learning theory. We then successfully tested wild honeybees Apis mellifera in the laboratory and Bombus vosnesenskii at field sites. Free-Moving Proboscis Extension Response is straightforward to implement, is low cost, and may be readily adapted to other flower-visiting insects. We believe it will be useful to a broad range of evolutionary biologists, behavioural ecologists and pollination ecologists interested in measuring cognitive performance in the wild and across a broader range of species.

The effect of removing numerically dominant, non-native honey bees on seed set of a native plant	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Introduced species; Native bees; Pollinator visitation; Pollination services; Seed set	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; INTRODUCED BEES; BUMBLE BEES; IMPACTS; MUTUALISM; METAANALYSIS; ECOSYSTEMS; NETWORK	Pollination services are compromised by habitat destruction, land-use intensification, pesticides, and introduced species. How pollination services respond to such stressors depends on the capacity of pollinator assemblages to function in the face of environmental disruption. Here, we quantify how pollination services provided to a native plant change upon removal of the non-native, western honey bee (Apis mellifera)-a numerically dominant floral visitor in the native bee-rich ecosystems of southern California. We focus on services provided to clustered tarweed (Deinandra fasciculata), a native, annual forb that benefits from outcross pollination. Across five different study sites in coastal San Diego County, tarweed flowers attracted 70 insect taxa, approximately half of which were native bees, but non-native honey bees were always the most abundant floral visitor at each site. To test the ability of the native insect fauna to provide pollination services, we performed Apis removals within experimental 0.25 m(2) plots containing approximately 20 tarweed plants and compared visitation and seed set between plants in removal and paired control plots (n = 16 pairs). Even though 92% of observed floral visits to control plots were from honey bees, Apis removal reduced seed production by only 14% relative to plants in control plots. These results indicate that native insect assemblages can contribute important pollination services even in ecosystems numerically dominated by introduced pollinators.

The decline of managed honeybees and the rapid expansion of mass-flowering crops increase the risk of pollination limitation in crops and raise questions about novel management approaches for wild pollinators in agroecosystems. Adding artificial nesting sites, such as trap nests, can promote cavity-nesting bees in agroecosystems, but effectiveness could be limited by the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape and by natural antagonists. 2. In two European regions, we exposed artificial trap nests in paired field boundaries adjacent to oilseed rape (OSR) fields or non-flowering crops for 2years within 32 landscapes covering two independent gradients of OSR cover and semi-natural habitat (SNH) cover in the landscape. We analysed the effects of local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity, landscape complexity and natural antagonists on community composition and population dynamics of trap-nesting bees. 3. Numbers of brood cells showed a strong, three-fold increase in response to the additional nesting sites. Species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting bees that were active during OSR flowering increased significantly with increasing amounts of early season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of OSR. Later foraging species benefited instead from the availability of late-season alternative flower resources or SNH cover once the mass-flowering had ceased. Density-dependent parasitism increased following mass-flowering, while no density-dependent effect was found during mass-flowering. 4. Structural equation modelling revealed that the influence of floral resource availability on community growth rate was mediated by community size. Community size showed a strong negative effect on community growth rate. Despite positive density-dependent parasitism, antagonists had only weak regulating effects on community growth rate. 5. Synthesis and applications. Trap-nesting bee populations grow markedly with the increasing availability of food resources in the landscape and effectiveness of trap nests is only marginally limited by natural antagonists. Thus, trap nests could be a simple pollinator-supporting strategy to accompany the current expansion of mass-flowering crops and to ensure pollination services for insect-pollinated crops. Trap nests benefit, not only early season active generalist bees during oilseed rape flowering, but also species with later phenology if accompanied by other pollinator-supporting practices.

J	Pope, NS; Jha, S				Pope, Nathaniel S.; Jha, Shalene			Seasonal Food Scarcity Prompts Long-Distance Foraging by a Wild Social Bee	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						bumblebee; dispersal; phenology; pollination; spatial ecology	LAND-USE; LANDSCAPE-SCALE; COLONY GROWTH; NEST DENSITY; POLLINATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; HYMENOPTERA; RANGE; POPULATIONS; BUMBLEBEES	Foraging is an essential process for mobile animals, and its optimization serves as a foundational theory in ecology and evolution; however, drivers of foraging are rarely investigated across landscapes and seasons. Using a common bumblebee species from the western United States (Bombus vosnesenskii), we ask whether seasonal decreases in food resources prompt changes in foraging behavior and space use. We employ a unique integration of population genetic tools and spatially explicit foraging models to estimate foraging distances and rates of patch visitation for wild bumblebee colonies across three study regions and two seasons. By mapping the locations of 669 wild-caught individual foragers, we find substantial variation in colony-level foraging distances, often exhibiting a 60-fold difference within a study region. Our analysis of visitation rates indicates that foragers display a preference for destination patches with high floral cover and forage significantly farther for these patches, but only in the summer, when landscape-level resources are low. Overall, these results indicate that an increasing proportion of long-distance foraging bouts take place in the summer. Because wild bees are pollinators, their foraging dynamics are of urgent concern, given the potential impacts of global change on their movement and services. The behavioral shift toward long-distance foraging with seasonal declines in food resources suggests a novel, phenologically directed approach to landscape-level pollinator conservation and greater consideration of late-season floral resources in pollinator habitat management.

The pesticide flupyradifurone impairs olfactory learning in Asian honey bees (&ITApis cerana&IT) exposed as larvae or as adults	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							APIS-CERANA; PROBOSCIS EXTENSION; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; RESPONSIVENESS; INSECTICIDE; SEMIFIELD; MELLIFERA; MEMORY	Relatively little attention has focused on how pesticides may affect Asian honey bees, which provide vital crop pollination services and are key native pollinators. We therefore studied the effects of a relatively new pesticide, flupyradifurone (FLU), which has been developed, in part, because it appears safer for honey bees than neonicotinoids. We tested the effects of FLU on Apis cerana olfactory learning in larvae (lower dose of 0.033 mu g/larvae/day over 6 days) and, in a separate experiment, adults (lower dose of 0.066 mu g/adult bee/day) at sublethal, field-realistic doses given over 3 days. A worst-case field-realistic dose is 0.44 mu g/bee/day. Learning was tested in adult bees. The lower larval dose did not increase mortality, but the lower adult dose resulted in 20% mortality. The lower FLU doses decreased average olfactory learning by 74% (larval treatment) and 48% (adult treatment) and reduced average memory by 48% (larval treatment) and 22% (adult treatment) as compared to controls. FLU at higher doses resulted in similar learning impairments. The effects of FLU, a pesticide that is reported to be safer than neonicotinoids for honey bees, thus deserve greater attention.

Bee pollination increases yield quantity and quality of cash crops in Burkina Faso, West Africa	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HONEY-BEES; FRUIT-SET; COTTON; SERVICES; DIVERSITY; INSECTS; ECOLOGY; TRENDS	Mutualistic biotic interactions as among flowering plants and their animal pollinators are a key component of biodiversity. Pollination, especially by insects, is a key element in ecosystem functioning, and hence constitutes an ecosystem service of global importance. Not only sexual reproduction of plants is ensured, but also yields are stabilized and genetic variability of crops is maintained, counteracting inbreeding depression and facilitating system resilience. While experiencing rapid environmental change, there is an increased demand for food and income security, especially in sub-Saharan communities, which are highly dependent on small scale agriculture. By combining exclusion experiments, pollinator surveys and field manipulations, this study for the first time quantifies the contribution of bee pollinators to smallholders' production of the major cash crops, cotton and sesame, in Burkina Faso. Pollination by honeybees and wild bees significantly increased yield quantity and quality on average up to 62%, while exclusion of pollinators caused an average yield gap of 37% in cotton and 59% in sesame. Self-pollination revealed inbreeding depression effects on fruit set and low germination rates in the F1-generation.

In situ modeling of multimodal floral cues attracting wild pollinators across environments	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						multimodal factors; categorization; syndrome; hoverfly; multivariate	EPISYRPHUS-BALTEATUS; MANDUCA-SEXTA; NECTAR; COLOR; SYRPHIDAE; PLANTS; SCENT; FIELD; CONSERVATION; PREFERENCES	With more than 80% of flowering plant species specialized for animal pollination, understanding how wild pollinators utilize resources across environments can encourage efficient planting and maintenance strategies to maximize pollination and establish resilience in the face of environmental change. A fundamental question is how generalist pollinators recognize "flower objects" in vastly different ecologies and environments. On one hand, pollinators could employ a specific set of floral cues regardless of environment. Alternatively, wild pollinators could recognize an exclusive signature of cues unique to each environment or flower species. Hoverflies, which are found across the globe, are one of the most ecologically important alternative pollinators after bees and bumblebees. Here, we have exploited their cosmopolitan status to understand how wild pollinator preferences change across different continents. Without employing any a priori assumptions concerning the floral cues, we measured, predicted, and finally artificially recreated multimodal cues from individual flowers visited by hoverflies in three different environments (hemiboreal, alpine, and tropical) using a field-based methodology. We found that although "flower signatures" were unique for each environment, some multimodal lures were ubiquitously attractive, despite not carrying any reward, or resembling real flowers. While it was unexpected that cue combinations found in real flowers were not necessary, the robustness of our lures across insect species and ecologies could reflect a general strategy of resource identification for generalist pollinators. Our results provide insights into how cosmopolitan pollinators such as hoverflies identify flowers and offer specific ecologically based cues and strategies for attracting pollinators across diverse environments.

J	Mallinger, RE; Gaines-Day, HR; Gratton, C				Mallinger, Rachel E.; Gaines-Day, Hannah R.; Gratton, Claudio			Do managed bees have negative effects on wild bees?: A systematic review of the literature	PLOS ONE			English	Review							AUSTRALIAN NATIVE BEE; HONEY-BEES; BUMBLE BEES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; APIS-MELLIFERA; FRUIT-SET; FLORAL RESOURCES; SPECIAL FOCUS; POLLINATOR; PATHOGEN	Managed bees are critical for crop pollination worldwide. As the demand for pollinator-dependent crops increases, so does the use of managed bees. Concern has arisen that managed bees may have unintended negative impacts on native wild bees, which are important pollinators in both agricultural and natural ecosystems. The goal of this study was to synthesize the literature documenting the effects of managed honey bees and bumble bees on wild bees in three areas: (1) competition for floral and nesting resources, (2) indirect effects via changes in plant communities, including the spread of exotic plants and decline of native plants, and (3) transmission of pathogens. The majority of reviewed studies reported negative effects of managed bees, but trends differed across topical areas. Of studies examining competition, results were highly variable with 53% reporting negative effects on wild bees, while 28% reported no effects and 19% reported mixed effects (varying with the bee species or variables examined). Equal numbers of studies examining plant communities reported positive (36%) and negative (36%) effects, with the remainder reporting no or mixed effects. Finally, the majority of studies on pathogen transmission (70%) reported potential negative effects of managed bees on wild bees. However, most studies across all topical areas documented the potential for impact (e.g. reporting the occurrence of competition or pathogens), but did not measure direct effects on wild bee fitness, abundance, or diversity. Furthermore, we found that results varied depending on whether managed bees were in their native or non-native range; managed bees within their native range had lesser competitive effects, but potentially greater effects on wild bees via pathogen transmission. We conclude that while this field has expanded considerably in recent decades, additional research measuring direct, long-term, and population-level effects of managed bees is needed to understand their potential impact on wild bees.

We report 3 studies in commercial Lowbush Blueberry fields: (1) a survey of diversity in Osmia (mason bees) and closely related Megachile (leaf-cutter bees) using trap nests in 93 fields from 1990 to 2012, (2) a 29-year study of a native bee community, and (3) an examination of climate-change effects on bee-foraging periods during blueberry bloom. Osmia appeared to be more stable over a 22-year period in their species richness and relative abundances in Lowbush Blueberry fields when compared to Megachile over a similar 17-year period. The native bee community in a single location in Winterport was observed to fluctuate in abundance 2 to 3 times annually. Modeling of the total bee community and taxa-specific group abundances (Bombus, Megachilids, Andrenids, and Halictids and other bees) suggest that while stochastic density-independent processes such as weather can play a role in determining their annual oscillations, density-dependent lags of 1 and 2 years appear to be the main driving forces. Estimation of fruit set over the same 29-year period, based upon native bee abundance, suggests that pollination is more buffered than community bee abundance, resulting in a lesser degree of fluctuation over time. We speculate that this finding is due to redundancy in floral preferences, multiple floral visitations, and differing pollination efficiencies by the highly diverse native bee community associated with Lowbush Blueberry. Effects of climate change in Maine Lowbush Blueberry fields during May bloom was investigated using a historic weather database. Since the early 1990s, precipitation has, to a large degree, reduced the number of optimal bee foraging days during bloom, with implications for pollination and bee species abundances. This new information reinforces the need for provision of pollinator gardens to support native pollinators of Lowbush Blueberry.

Most pear species exhibit full self-incompatibility and thus depend entirely on cross-pollination. However, as little is known about the pear visitation preferences of native Apis cerana (Fabricius; Hymenoptera: Apidae) and adventive Apis mellifera (L.; Hymenoptera: Apidae) in China. A comparative analysis was performed to explore the pear-foraging differences of these species under the natural conditions of pear growing areas. The results show significant variability in the pollen-gathering tendency of these honey bees. Compared to A. mellifera, A. cerana begins foraging at an earlier time of day and gathers a larger amount of pollen in the morning. Based on pollen collection data, A. mellifera shows variable preferences: vigorously foraging on pear on the first day of observation but collecting pollen from non-target floral resources on other experimental days. Conversely, A. cerana persists in pear pollen collection, without shifting preference to other competitive flowers. Therefore, A. cerana outperforms adventive A. mellifera with regard to pear pollen collection under natural conditions, which may lead to increased pear pollination. This study supports arguments in favor of further multiplication and maintenance of A. cerana for pear and other native crop pollination. Moreover, it is essential to develop alternative pollination management techniques to utilize A. mellifera for pear pollination.

Life-history traits of wild honey bee colonies living in forests around Ithaca, NY, USA	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						Apismellifera; life-history evolution; colony survival; deformed wing virus; Varroa destructor; wild honey bees	NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; VARROA-JACOBSONI OUD; APIS-MELLIFERA; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; PARASITIC MITE; POPULATION; DESTRUCTOR; SURVIVAL; SIZE	Wild honey bee colonies-both truly wild (in trees and buildings) and simulated wild (in small hives)-were studied to determine their life-history traits, to see if these traits have changed now that these colonies are infested with Varroa destructor. Most colonies (97%) survive summers, but only 23% of founder (first-year) colonies and 84% of established colonies survive winters. Established colonies have a mean lifespan of 5-6 years and most (87%) have a queen turnover (probably by swarming) each summer. A population model shows that these life-history traits produce a stable population of colonies. Remarkably, the suite of colony life-history traits found in the 2010s (with V. destructor) matches that found in the 1970s (without V. destructor). It seems likely that the wild colonies living near Ithaca, NY, possess defenses against V. destructor that are not costly.

J	Russo, L; Danforth, B				Russo, Laura; Danforth, Bryan			Pollen preferences among the bee species visiting apple (Malus pumila) in New York	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						agricultural pollination; alternative pollen hosts; floral provisioning; pollen analysis; pollination services; wild bee communities	APIS-MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA; POLLINATION SERVICES; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; SOLITARY BEES; DIET BREADTH; HONEY-BEES; FRUIT-SET; BODY-SIZE; WILD BEES; DIVERSITY	Maintaining a diverse and abundant wild bee community is essential for sustainable agricultural pollination, especially in crops in which wild bees are effective pollinators. Many land managers have an economic interest in encouraging healthy wild bee populations, but it is not always clear how to accomplish this. In apple orchards, wild bees play a critical role as pollinators, but are active before most forbs begin to flower. To investigate which flowering plant species might serve as alternative pollen hosts for the most abundant wild bee species collected in eastern apple orchards, we analyzed the pollen carried by 15 wild bee species and 1 managed bee species (Apis mellifera) collected during apple bloom. We identified the pollen grains carried by these bees and found that the majority of alternative pollen hosts for apple visitors are early blooming tree species, including six other tree genera. This may partly explain why the presence of forest fragments is an important predictor of bee abundance and species richness in New York apple orchards.

Protecting a managed bee pollinator against climate change: strategies for an area with extreme climatic conditions and socioeconomic vulnerability	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						conservation; economy; landscape ecology; Melipona subnitida; pollination; restoration; sustainability	CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; RESTORATION; SERVICE	In the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil, populations of native bees can be jeopardized by future climate change. The present study aims to analyze the impact of climate change on a native stingless bee (Melipona subnitida Ducke). This species is a locally important pollinator of wild and crop plants, also exploited for honey production by regional beekeepers. Using species distributional modeling, we assessed the effects of climate change on the geographic distribution of M. subnitida. We found a potential shift in future areas where species can find climatically suitable habitats toward the edges of the current pollinator distribution with a consequent central disconnection, which can threaten species dispersal and gene flow. We propose to reconnect the remaining suitable areas through conservation and restoration programs based on the distribution of the plant species that are used by this bee as source of pollen and nectar and propose also, other strategies that aim to increase the welfare of local people.

According to IPBES, a lack of wild pollinator data contributes to difficulties in comprehensively analyzing the regional status of wild pollinators in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Oceania. It may have also contributed to the prevailing lack of awareness of the diversity of honey bees, of which the managed Apis mellifera is often considered as "the (only) honey bee," despite the fact that there are eight other honey bee species extant in Asia. A survey of 100 journal articles published in 2016 shows that 57% of the studies still identified A. mellifera as "the honey bee." In total, 80% of studies were conducted solely on A. mellifera. This focus on A. mellifera has also caused the honey standard of Codex Alimentarius and the European Union to be based solely on A. mellifera, causing improper evaluation of honeys from other species. We recommend adapting current standards to reflect the diversity of honey bees and in the process correct failures in the honey market and pave the way towards improved protection of honey bee species and their habitats.

Enhancing key floral resources is essential to effectively mitigate the loss of pollinator diversity and associated provisioning of pollination functions in agro-ecosystems. However, effective floral provisioning measures may diverge among different pollinator conservation targets, such as the conservation of rare species or the promotion of economically important crop pollinators. We examined to what extent such diverging conservation goals could be reconciled. 2. We analysed plant-bee visitation networks of 64 herbaceous semi-natural habitats representing a gradient of plant species richness to identify key resource plants of the three distinct conservation target groups: rare bees (of conservation concern), dominant wild crop-pollinating bees and managed crop-pollinating bees (i.e. honeybees). 3. Considering overall flower visitation, rare bees tended to visit nested subsets of plant species that were also visited by crop pollinators (46% and 77% nestedness in the dissimilarity between rare bees and wild crop pollinators or managed honeybees respectively). However, the set of preferred plant species, henceforth key plant species' (i.e. those species disproportionately more visited than expected according to their floral abundance) was considerably more distinct and less nested among bee target groups. 4. Flower visits of all bee target groups increased with plant species richness at a similar rate. Importantly, our analyses revealed that an exponential increase in the flower abundance of the identified key plant species and complementarity in the bee visitation pattern across plant species - rather than total flower abundance - were the major drivers of these relationships. 5. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the multiple goals of preserving high bee diversity, conserving rare species and sustaining crop pollinators can be reconciled if key plant species of different target groups are simultaneously available. This availability is facilitated by a high floral resource complementarity in the plant community. The list of identified key resource plant species we provide here can help practitioners such as land managers and conservationists to better design and evaluate pollinator conservation and restoration measures according to their goals.

J	Drossart, M; Michez, D; Vanderplanck, M				Drossart, Maxime; Michez, Denis; Vanderplanck, Maryse			Invasive plants as potential food resource for native pollinators: A case study with two invasive species and a generalist bumble bee	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							AMINO-ACIDS; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; PROTEIN-CONTENT; POLLEN; PREFERENCES; HONEYBEE; HYMENOPTERA; EVOLUTION; NETWORKS; DECLINES	It is now well established that invasive plants may induce drifts in the quantity and/or quality of floral resources. They are then often pointed out as a potential driver of bee decline. However, their impact on bee population remains quite unclear and still controversial, as bee responses are highly variable among species. Here, we compared the amino acid composition of pollen from three native and two invasive plant species included in diets of common pollinators in NW Europe. Moreover, the nutritional intake (i.e., pollen and amino acid intakes) of Bombus terrestris colonies and the pollen foraging behaviour of workers (i.e., visiting rate, number of foraging trips, weight of pollen loads) were considered. We found significant differences in pollen nutrients among the studied species according to the plant invasive behaviour. We also found significant differences in pollen foraging behaviour according to the plant species, from few to several foraging trips carrying small or large pollen loads. Such behavioural differences directly impacted the pollen intake but depended more likely on plant morphology rather than on plant invasive behaviour. These results suggest that common generalist bumble bees might not always suffer from plant invasions, depending on their behavioural plasticity and nutritional requirements.

J	Quinet, M; Jacquemart, AL				Quinet, Muriel; Jacquemart, Anne-Laure			Cultivar placement affects pollination efficiency and fruit production in European pear (&ITPyrus communis&IT) orchards	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						Bumble bee (Bombus terrestris); Foraging behaviour; Honey bee (Apis mellifera); Orchard design; Solitary bees	OSMIA-CORNUTA HYMENOPTERA; DENSITY APPLE ORCHARDS; PYRUS-COMMUNIS; HONEY-BEE; POLLEN DISPERSAL; SET; L.; APIDAE; BUMBLEBEES; FLOWERS	European pear (Pyrus communis) requires insect pollination among compatible cultivars for fruit production. However, most commercial orchards have a limited number of cultivars arranged in monotypic blocks or rows. This can result in insufficient inter-cultivar pollination. We hypothesise that limitations in pollen transfer among cultivars could be explained by both insect behaviour and orchard design. We compared insect activity and pollination efficiency in two European pear cultivars, in orchards with different designs: (i) cultivars alternated in the same row or (ii) cultivars in separate rows. To assess limitations in pollen transfer, we also compared hand pollination with compatible pollen versus open pollination by insects. Insect visitors mainly foraged on neighbouring trees within a row, with few movements across rows (1%). Honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) visited significantly more flowers per tree (8.5 vs. 3) and more trees (2.1 vs. 1.3) than solitary bees (Andrena spp.) and hoverflies. Insect visitors deposited large amounts of pollen (similar to 500 pollen grains) on flower stigmas regardless of the insect type. Cultivar placement affected inter-cultivar pollination; less incompatibility signs were observed when cultivars alternated in the same row (5%) than when cultivars were in separate rows (38%). We observed limitations in pollen transfer as open pollination resulted in significant reduced fruit set, compared with hand pollination, in 'Conference' (21% vs. 30.7%) and 'Doyenne du Comice' (7.2% vs. 16.8%). The foraging behaviour of the insects limited thus inter-cultivar pollen transfer in the orchards with cultivars in separate rows. Cultivars used for pollination (pollinizers) should be planted in the same rows as the main cultivar to increase inter-cultivar pollination.

The relation between oilseed rape and pollination of later flowering plants varies across plant species and landscape contexts	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Rapeseed; Canola; Tongue-length; Fragaria vesca; Trifolium pratense; Brassica napus	RED-CLOVER; BUMBLEBEES; CROPS; BEES; REPRODUCTION; DENSITIES; DECLINES; DILUTION; SUCCESS; SIZE	Increasing cultivation of oilseed rape may have consequences for pollinators and wild plant pollination. By providing pollinating insects with pollen and nectar, oilseed rape benefits short-tongued, generalist insect species. Long-tongued bumble bee species, specialized to other flower types, may instead be negatively affected by increased competition from the generalists (e.g. due to nectar-robbing of long-tubed flowers) after oilseed rape flowering has ceased. We expected that the increased abundance of short-tongued pollinators and reduced abundance of long-tongued bumble bees in landscapes with a high proportion of oilseed rape would impact the pollination of later flowering wild plant species. In addition, we expected contrasting effects on plants pollinated by short-tongued pollinators and those pollinated by long-tongued bumble bees. We predicted that semi-natural grasslands, which provide insects with alternative floral resources, would reduce both negative and positive effects on pollination by mitigating competition between pollinators. In 16 semi-natural grasslands, surrounded by agricultural landscapes, with a variation in both the proportion of oilseed rape and the proportion of semi-natural grassland within 1 km, we studied reproductive output in two species of potted plants with different pollination strategies: the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and red clover (Trifolium pratense). The first species is mainly pollinated by short-tongued pollinators, e.g. hoverflies and solitary bees, and the latter by long-tongued bumble bees. Both species flowered after oilseed rape. Strawberry weight was higher in landscapes with a high proportion of oilseed rape, but only in landscapes with a low proportion of semi-natural grassland. The proportion of developed achenes was also positively related to the proportion of oilseed rape, but only during the latest flowering period. In contrast, red clover seed set was unrelated to the proportion of oilseed rape. Whereas the discrepancy between the two strawberry measurements calls for further research, this study suggests that oilseed rape can affect later flowering plants and that the impact differs among species.

J	Wood, TJ; Roberts, SPM				Wood, Thomas J.; Roberts, Stuart P. M.			An assessment of historical and contemporary diet breadth in polylectic Andrena bee species	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Agricultural intensification; Pollen preferences; Agri-environment schemes; Hedgerows; Rosaceae; Pollen mixing; Toxic pollen	SOLITARY BEES; POLLEN; HYMENOPTERA; SPECIALIZATION; POLLINATORS; PLANTS; BUMBLEBEES; EVOLUTION; DECLINES; HABITAT	The loss of key forage plants and a narrow pollen diet have both been implicated in the decline of wild bees over the past 70 years. These ideas have been studied extensively in recent years in bumblebees (Bombus spp.), but have rarely been investigated in other bee groups, due in part to a lack of detailed ecological data for many species of wild bee. Chambers (1968) extensively documented pollen preferences in bees from the genus Andrena collected in Bedfordshire, UK, during the 1940s, before the period of rapid agricultural intensification following the Second World War. This extensive dataset allows for the importance of diet breadth in modifying the response of bees to environmental change to be investigated in a common and widespread but understudied genus of bees. We compared the pollen preferences of a suite of Andrena species collected in the 1941-1949 period with a similar suite of Andrena species collected between 1985 and 2016. Relative diet breadth was consistent across studied species between the historical and contemporary period. However, dietary composition changed with a shift away from Rosaceae and towards Brassicaceae. The reduction in the collection of Rosaceae pollen was more pronounced in spring-flying than summer-flying Andrena, which may be due to a reduction in the length and quality of hedgerow habitats and hence spring-flowering woody Rosaceae present in the countryside, and an increase in the availability of the mass-flowering crop oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Both historical and contemporary diet breadth were significant positive predictors of how frequently Andrena species are encountered on contemporary farmland, with those species with a relatively wider diet present on the majority of farms. These findings support the idea that inherent differences in diet breadth mediate the ability of bee species to respond to changes in resource availability resulting from agricultural intensification. A more detailed understanding of species-level characteristics can help improve our understanding of why seemingly similar species respond very differently to environmental change.

Combined next-generation and classical sequencing approaches were applied to discover and study new insect viruses potentially harmful to bees. A bioinformatics virus discovery pipeline was used on individual Illumina transcriptomes of 13 wild bees from three species from the genus Halictus and 30 ants from six species of the genera Messor and Aphaenogaster. This allowed the discovery and description of three sequences of a new virus termed Halictus scabiosae Adlikon virus (HsAV). Phylogenetic analyses of 0RF1, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) and capsid genes showed that HsAV is closely related to (+)ssRNA viruses of the unassigned Sinaivirus genus but distant enough to belong to a different new genus we called Halictivirus. In addition, our study of ant transcriptomes revealed the first four sinaivirus sequences from ants (Messor barbarus, M. capitatus and M. concolor). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed on a 594 nt fragment of the 0RF1/RdRp region from 84 sinaivirus sequences, including 31 new Lake Sinai viruses (LSVs) from honey bees collected in five countries across the globe and the four ant viral sequences. The phylogeny revealed four main clades potentially representing different viral species infecting honey bees. Moreover, the ant viruses belonged to the LSV4 clade, suggesting a possible cross-species transmission between bees and ants. Lastly, wide honey bee screening showed that all four LSV clades have worldwide distributions with no obvious geographical segregation.

Given the worldwide extension of the beekeeping practice and the diversity of pathogens affecting Apis mellifera populations, honey bee colonies are a certain source of parasite dispersion to other species. Here, we communicate the detection of the microsporidium Nosema ceranae, a relatively new parasite of honey bees, in stingless bees (Meliponini) and the social wasp Polybia scutellaris (Vespidae) samples from Argentina and Brazil by means of duplex PCR. Beyond the geographic location of the nests, N. ceranae was detected in seven from the eight Meliponini species analyzed, while Nosema apis, another common parasite of A. mellifera, was absent in all samples tested. Further research is necessary to determine if the presence of the parasite is also associated with established infection in host tissues. The obtained information enriches the current knowledge about pathologies that can infect or, at least, be vectored by native wild pollinators from South America.

Although considered "bee-safe," there is mounting evidence that fungicide residues in pollen are associated with bee declines (for both honey and bumble bee species). While the mechanisms remain relatively unknown, researchers have speculated that bee-microbe symbioses are involved. Microbes play a pivotal role in the preservation and/or processing of pollen, which serves as nutrition for larval bees. By altering the microbial community, it is likely that fungicides disrupt these microbe-mediated services, and thereby compromise bee health. This manuscript describes the protocols used to investigate the indirect mechanism(s) by which fungicides may be causing colony decline. Cage experiments exposing bees to fungicide-treated flowers have already provided the first evidence that fungicides cause profound colony losses in a native bumble bee (Bombus impatiens). Using field-relevant doses of fungicides, a series of experiments have been developed to provide a finer description of microbial community dynamics of fungicide-exposed pollen. Shifts in the structural composition of fungal and bacterial assemblages within the pollen microbiome are investigated by next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis. Experiments developed herein have been designed to provide a mechanistic understanding of how fungicides affect the microbiome of pollen-provisions. Ultimately, these findings should shed light on the indirect pathway through which fungicides may be causing colony declines.

Seed herbivores are commonly used as biocontrol agents but may also act as flower visitors, potentially resulting in pollination. However, such contrasting or potentially counterproductive interaction effects are rarely considered or evaluated for biological control programs. We investigated the breeding system and pollinators of Bitou Bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata), an invasive species in Australia that has been the subject of biocontrol programs since 1987. We found the species to be obligate outcrossing in all six populations tested. From 150 video hours, we found 21 species of potential pollinators, including Mesoclanis polana, the Bitou Seedfly, native to South Africa and released in Australia as a biocontrol agent in 1996. Mesoclanis polana transferred pollen to stigmas and was the most common pollinator (52% of pollinator visits), followed by the syrphid fly Simosyrphus grandicornis (9%) and introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera (6.5%). Fruit-to-flower ratios ranged from 0.12 to 0.45 and were highest in the population with the greatest proportion of Mesoclanis polana visits. In an experimental trial, outside the naturalized range, the native bee Homalictus sphecodoides and the native syrphid Melangyna viridiceps were the primary pollinators, and fruit-to-flower ratios were 0.35, indicating that Bitou Bush would have ready pollinators if its range expanded inland. Synthesis. Invasive Bitou Bush requires pollinators, and this is effected by a range of generalist pollinators in eastern Australia including the Bitou Seedfly, introduced as a biocontrol agent, and the major pollinator detected in this study. Fruit-to-flower ratios were highest when the Bitou Seedfly was in high abundance.

Our study analyzed variability of native bees and honey bees, and the risks these pose to profitability of Maine's wild blueberry industry. We used cross-sectional data from organic, low-, medium-, and high-input wild blueberry producers in 1993, 1997-1998, 2005-2007, and from 2011 to 2015 (n = 162 fields). Data included native and honey bee densities (count/m(2)/min) and honey bee stocking densities (hives/ha). Blueberry fruit set, yield, and honey bee hive stocking density models were estimated. Fruit set is impacted about 1.6 times more by native bees than honey bees on a per bee basis. Fruit set significantly explained blueberry yield. Honey bee stocking density in fields predicted honey bee foraging densities. These three models were used in enterprise budgets for all four systems from on-farm surveys of 23 conventional and 12 organic producers (2012-2013). These budgets formed the basis of Monte Carlo simulations of production and profit. Stochastic dominance of net farm income (NFI) cumulative distribution functions revealed that if organic yields are high enough (2,345 kg/ha), organic systems are economically preferable to conventional systems. However, if organic yields are lower (724 kg/ha), it is riskier with higher variability of crop yield and NFI. Although medium-input systems are stochastically dominant with lower NFI variability compared with other conventional systems, the high-input system breaks even with the low-input system if honey bee hive rental prices triple in the future.

The impact of honey bee colony quality on crop yield and farmers' profit in apples and pears	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Apis mellifera; Apples; Colony quality; Generalized multilevel path model; Farmer profits; Pears; Pollination	POLLINATOR-DEPENDENT CROP; FRUIT-SET; SEED NUMBER; SPECIES RICHNESS; INSECT POLLINATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PYRUS-COMMUNIS; WILD BEES; ORCHARDS; HYMENOPTERA	Despite global interest in the role of pollinators for food production, their impact on farmers' profit, which determines farmers' livelihood and land-use decisions, is unclear. Although average values of pollinator benefits are generally assumed, there is potential for large spatial variation among crop species and varieties or among pollinator management strategies, even within the same region and year. We studied how quality of honey bee colonies used for pollination services, which included artificial feeding during winter and pathogen control, affect flower visitation, fruit production, and farmers' profit in the main apple and pear producing region of Argentina (Patagonia). For apple, high-quality colonies exhibited flower-visitation rates 130% greater than conventional colonies. Indeed, high-quality colonies increased fruit set by 15% (increasing production quantity), seed set and fruit sugar content, and subsequently farmefs profits by 70%. For pear, colony quality only affected fruit weight of the Abate Fetel variety, but not that of the Packham's Triumph variety. Fruits were 20% heavier in farms deploying high quality colonies but did not contribute to increase farmers' profits to the extent that it did for apple. In contrast to studies conducted elsewhere, we did not observe any wild pollinators visiting apple or pear flowers, highlighting the fragility of this conventionally intensified crop production system. We found that such orchard systems can suffer large pollinator deficits affecting farmers' profit Given that A. mellifera was the only flower visitor, we could estimate the impact of improving colony management on farmer's profit without the influence of other pollinators. Our study also shows that variations within pome crops, ie. apples and varieties of pears, in pollinator benefits can be very large, and that the assumption of global average values to guide local recommendations can be misleading.

A general expectation is that a decreasing cover of semi-natural habitats negatively affects pollinator reproduction, population size and pollination services, but few studies have investigated the simultaneous effects of landscape complexity on different aspects of pollinator communities and functioning. In 20 agricultural landscape plots the size of an average Dutch farm, we studied how changing landscape complexity affected wild bee abundance, species richness and reproduction. To measure pollination, we placed potted strawberry plants as phytometers in landscapes. Landscape complexity was characterized as the area of semi-natural habitats. In addition, we estimated floral resource abundance in each landscape plot. We expected that i) bee species richness, reproduction and pollination would be positively related to area of semi-natural habitats and flower abundance, and that ii) species richness and reproduction would be positively related to pollination. An increase in semi-natural habitats in landscapes increased both the abundance of cavity-nesting bees colonizing trap nests, and the growth rates of experimental Bombus terrestris L. colonies, but not the species richness of wild bees measured by pan traps. There was only a tendency for higher pollination levels of strawberry plants with higher cover of semi-natural habitats. There was no relationship between species richness and bee reproduction in a landscape and the pollination services. Estimated flower abundance in landscape had a positive effect on bumblebee colony growth only and not on the other variables. Our results suggest that, by improving habitat quality on their farms through establishing more semi-natural habitats or enhancing the flower availability in semi-natural habitats, farmers can promote reproduction of a number of functionally important bee species and the pollination services they provide. Bee species richness, however, seems to be More difficult to enhance and requires more than just creating more of the same type of habitats or flowers.

Honey bees are the dominant diurnal pollinator of native milkweed in a large urban park	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Apis mellifera; host shift; invasive plants; pollination; pollinia; urban	VINCETOXICUM-ROSSICUM; ASCLEPIAS-SYRIACA; INVASIVE ALIEN; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; BUMBLE BEES; NECTAR; IMPACTS; DECLINE; POLLEN; PLANTS	In eastern North America, the field milkweed, Asclepias syriaca L. (Asclepiadaceae), is used in planting schemes to promote biodiversity conservation for numerous insects including the endangered monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (Linnaeus) (Nymphalidae). Less is known about its pollinators, and especially in urban habitats where it is planted often despite being under increasing pressure from invasive plant species, such as the related milkweed, the dog-strangling vine (DSV), Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleopow) Barbar. (Asclepiadaceae). During the A.syriaca flowering period in July 2016, we surveyed bees in open habitats along a DSV invasion gradient and inspected 433 individuals of 25 bee species in 12 genera for pollinia: these were affixed to bees that visited A.syriaca for nectar and contain pollen packets that are vectored (e.g., transferred) between flowers. Of all bees sampled, pollinia were found only on the nonindigenous honeybee, Apis mellifera (43% of all bees identified), as well as one individual bumblebee, Bombus impatiens Cresson. Pollinia were recorded from 45.2% of all honeybees collected. We found no relationship between biomass of DSV and biomass of A.syriaca per site. There was a significant positive correlation between A.syriaca biomass and the number of pollinia, and the proportion vectored. No relationship with DSV biomass was detected for the number of pollinia collected by bees but the proportion of vectored pollinia declined with increasing DSV biomass. Although we find no evidence of DSV flowers attracting potential pollinators away from A.syriaca and other flowering plants, the impacts on native plant-pollinator mutualisms relate to its ability to outcompete native plants. As wild bees do not appear to visit DSV flowers, it could be altering the landscape to one which honeybees are more tolerant than native wild bees.

Heavy metal pollution of the environment is one of the most widely studied stressors in insects, yet its effect is poorly described in bees. We have measured how pollution of the environment along a zinc, cadmium and lead contamination gradient in Poland affects bee development, using red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) as a model and their forewing asymmetry measures to assess possible developmental instabilities. We have also described wing asymmetry measures in the red mason bee-an important managed pollinator species-for the first time. The development of bee larvae in a contaminated environment did not affect forewing asymmetry measures, but it did lead to a negative correlation of wing size with contamination in females. Bees also showed a clear change in their asymmetry measures between various seasons, suggesting other, unknown environmental factors affecting wing asymmetry more than pollution. Sexes were found to have different forewing shape and size, larger females having larger forewings than the smaller males. The direction of size asymmetry was in favour of the left side in both sexes and also shape differences between the left and right wings showed similar tendencies in males and females. The levels of forewing shape and size asymmetry were smaller in females, making them the more symmetrical sex.

Nutritional Regulation of Phenotypic Plasticity in a Solitary Bee (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						developmental plasticity; diapause; nutrition	ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE; SMALL CARPENTER BEE; ROTUNDATA HYMENOPTERA; BODY-SIZE; DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NESTING SUCCESS; F HYMENOPTERA; FEMALE SIZE; EVOLUTION	Phenotypic plasticity involves adaptive responses to predictable environmental fluctuations and may promote evolutionary change. We studied the regulation of phenotypic plasticity in an important agricultural pollinator, the solitary alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata F.). Specifically, we investigated how larval nutrition affects M. rotundata diapause plasticity and how diapause plasticity affects adult female reproductive behavior. Field surveys and laboratory manipulations of aspects of larval diet demonstrated nutritional regulation of M. rotundata diapause plasticity. Manipulation of larval diet quality through the addition of royal jelly, the caste-determining substance of the honey bee Apis mellifera L., increased the probability of diapause in M. rotundata. We also found that larval nutrition and diapause status affected M. rotundata adult female reproductive behavior. Nutritional effects on larval diapause that also impact adult fitness have intriguing implications for the evolution of developmental plasticity in bees. In particular, as the solitary lifestyle of M. rotundata is considered to be the ancestral condition in bees, nutritionally regulated plasticity may have been an ancestral condition in all bees that facilitated the evolution of other forms of phenotypic plasticity, such as the castes of social bees.

Nectar and Pollen Phytochemicals Stimulate Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Immunity to Viral Infection	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						immune priming; plant secondary metabolite; medicinal plant; tritrophic interaction; colony collapse disorder	DEFORMED WING VIRUS; PATHOGENS NOSEMA-CERANAE; SYZYGIUM-AROMATICUM L.; APIS-MELLIFERA; ESSENTIAL OILS; HORIZONTAL TRANSMISSION; FLORAL PHYTOCHEMICALS; PERITROPHIC MATRIX; ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY; NICOTINE	Parasites and pathogens are implicated in honey bee colony losses, and honey bees may also spread infection to wild pollinators. Bees consume nectar and pollen, which contain phytochemicals that can positively or negatively affect pollinator health. Certain phytochemicals can reduce parasite loads in humans and other animals. Understanding how phytochemicals affect honey bee infection and survival could help identify optimal forage sources and phytochemical treatments to ameliorate disease. We fed honey bees seven dietary phytochemicals to evaluate whether phytochemical consumption would treat preexisting infection in mature bees, or mitigate infection in young bees either inside or outside of their colonies. Phytochemicals were generally well-tolerated at levels documented in nectar, honey, and pollen, although clove oil and thymol increased mortality at high doses. Six of seven tested phytochemicals significantly increased antimicrobial peptide expression by 12.9 to 61-fold in older bees after 7 d consumption. Short-term (< 24 h) phytochemical consumption reduced levels of Deformed wing virus (DWV) up to 500-fold in young bees released into field colonies. However, with the exception of high-dose clove oil, our phytochemical treatments did not alter infection with Lotmaria passim or Nosema ceranae. Phytochemicals also lacked antiviral effects for pollen-deprived bees reared outside the colony. Our results suggest that phytochemicals have potential therapeutic value for honey bees infected with DWV. Short-term phytochemical consumption may be sufficient to confer benefits against infection. Phytochemical concentrations that reduced disease were comparable with naturally occurring floral concentrations, suggesting that flowers could serve as seasonally varied, serially consumed pollinator medicines.

In this paper we combine ecological modelling with economic analysis to investigate the effects of pesticide use on wild and commercial bees, whilst allowing farmers to partly offset the negative effects of pesticides on bee populations by creating more on-farm bee habitat. Farmers have incentives to invest in creating wild bee habitat to increase pollination inputs due to the contribution this makes to yields. However, the optimal allocation of on-farm habitat strongly depends on the negative effects of pesticides, with a threshold-like behaviour at a critical level of the impairment. When this threshold is crossed, the population of wild bees becomes locally extinct and their availability to pollinate breaks down. We show that availability of commercial bees masks this decrease in pollination services which would otherwise incentivise farmers to conserve the wild pollinator population. Indeed, if commercial bees are available, optimum profit may be achieved by providing no habitat at all for wild bees, and allowing these wild pollinators to go extinct. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It plays an important role in innate immunity of insects. Little is known on the expression characteristic and function of PEBP in bees. In the current study, we cloned the pebp gene and investigated its expression profiles at different developmental stages and reproductive status from bumblebee, Bombus lantschouensis (Vogt), which is one of the most abundant pollinators for wild plants and crops in Northern China. Two transcripts (PEBPX1 and PEBPX2) of the pebp gene were cloned for the first time. The transcript PEBPX2 lacked a signal peptide sequence compared to PEBPX1. The full-length cDNA of these two PEBP transcripts is 1005 bp and 915 bp, with an open reading frame of 627 bp and 549 bp, respectively. Transcript PEBPX2 was one order of magnitude more expressed than transcript PEBPX1 at most of the developmental stages and different reproductive status (egg-laying versus non- egg-laying females). Both of the PEBP transcripts were highly expressed in brown-eyed with light and dark pigmented cuticle pupae stages. Quantitative PCR and Western Blot demonstrated that PEBP was significantly up-regulated in egg-laying females. In summary, we suggest that levels of these two PEBPs could be related to the regulation of reproduction in bumblebees. In addition, both transcripts likely play an important role in the metamorphosis developmental stage of bumblebee pupae.

Generalized food-deceptive pollination in four Cattleya (Orchidaceae: Laeliinae) species from Southern Brazil	FLORA			English	Article						Atlantic rain forest; Bombus; Chlorostilbon; Hummingbirds; Non-rewarding orchids; Xylocopa	REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; BEE POLLINATION; FRUIT-SET; MECHANISMS; EPIDENDROIDEAE; EVOLUTION; PATTERN; MIMICRY; REWARD; SEEDS	We studied the breeding system and pollination biology of Cattleya coccinea, C. intermedia, C. purpurata and C. tigrina in native populations from Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. At the State level, the three latter species are considered under risk of extinction and this work is intended to be a contribution towards their conservation and management. To date, their pollination needs and breeding system remain unknown. Breeding system was elucidated through controlled pollinations applied to isolated plants. Pollination was studied in the field, by means of photographic and filmic records. Cattleya purpurata, C. intermedia and C. tigrina are pollinated by large native Apidae bees of the genera Bombus, Xylocopa and Epicharis that bear the pollinaria on the scutellum and mesonotum. In spite of their differences in colour and perianth size, bee-pollinated species share a number of flower features which are absent in C. coccinea. The latter species is pollinated by the hummingbird Chlorostilbon lucidus (Trochilidae). In agreement, flowers of C. coccinea present a set of flower features normally associated to ornithophily. All studied species lack rewards and deceive their food-seeking pollinators. All species are self-compatible but pollinator dependent. Fruiting success following manual self-pollination and cross-pollination did not differ, except in C. coccinea. However, in all species fruit from cross-pollinations yielded significantly higher numbers of viable seed. All studied species displayed low visitation rates, low natural fruit set (ranging from 0.5 to 14%) and Nilsson's male efficiency factor of less than one, indicating that less than one flower was pollinated per pollinarium removed. All these features are consistent with those of other orchid groups pollinated through generalized food-deception. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

According to global estimates, honeybees and wild bees contribute equally to this ecosystem service, although there are no systematic studies for Switzerland. Now, for the first time, and with the help of data on the area and distribution of insect dependent crops and their yields, the direct economic value for Switzerland of pollination services was calculated, and shown to range between CHF 205 and 479 million per year. In Switzerland, pollination-dependent crops are cultivated on approx. 5 % of the utilised agricultural area and 14 % of the arable land. On a nationwide average, the potential spatial coverage of these crops by honeybees is relatively good. Particularly on the western Central Plateau and in the Valais, however, coverage is patchy. Whether this leads to yield losses owing to pollination deficits, and whether and how the targeted support of naturally occurring wild bees or the use of additional honeybees and managed wild bees contributes to a better pollination outcome, will require further investigations.

Pollinators Unknown: People's Perception of Native Bees in an Agrarian District of West Bengal, India, and Its Implication in Conservation	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE			English	Article						pollinator bees; awareness campaign; West Midnapore district; pollinator conservation; people's participation	CITIZEN SCIENCE; FRUIT-SET; MANAGEMENT; HONEYBEES; KNOWLEDGE; DIVERSITY; VARIANCE; SERVICES; BEHAVIOR	Native bees are important pollinators of cultivated and wild plants. Although much importance has been accorded them in many countries of the world, India has largely ignored the role of these important ecosystem service providers for too long. The consequence is public apathy toward these beneficial insects. This study has attempted to find out the general "bee awareness'' of people living in agrarian societies in a socioeconomically underdeveloped Indian district through picture-based questionnaire surveys and has also attempted to determine the effectiveness of information divulgation in changing people's perception toward native bees. Opinion of the people on honeybee health in this district has also been explored. It has been found that traditional knowledge of bees is largely restricted to the honey-producing species of the genus Apis, and even though other native species are frequently encountered by the people, there is a substantial lack of awareness about their true nature and importance. However, the study suggests that through right training, this situation may favorably be altered. Multiple regression analysis of socioeconomic factors determining bee knowledge of respondents revealed that women were > 4 times better at identifying native bees than men, both with or without given information, and the higher the level of education the better people were at identifying native bees. People considered pesticides and their irregular application to be the major killers of honeybees. This study generates hope for involvement of local people in native as well as honeybee conservation and management through proper awareness campaigns and right education.

Their venoms are composed of a number of peptides and proteins and used for defending their nests and themselves from predators. In contrast, the venoms of solitary wasps and bees have not been the object of further research. In case of solitary bees, only major peptide components in a few venoms have been addressed. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the peptide component profile of the venom from the solitary bee Xylocopa appendiculata circumvolans by peptidomic analysis with using LC-MS. Methods: A reverse-phase HPLC connected to ESI-OrbiTrap MS was used for LC-MS. On-line mass fingerprinting was made from TIC, and data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry gave MSMS spectra. A major peptide component was isolated by reverse-phase HPLC by conventional way, and its sequence was determined by Edman degradation, which was finally corroborated by solid phase synthesis. Using the synthetic specimen, biological activities (antimicrobial activity, mast cell devaluation, hemolysis, leishmanicidal activity) and pore formation in artificial lipid bilayer were evaluated. Results: On-line mass fingerprinting revealed that the crude venom contained 124 components. MS/MS analysis gave 75 full sequences of the peptide components. Most of these are related to the major and novel peptide, xylopin. Its sequence, GFVALLKKLPLILKHLH-NH2, has characteristic features of linear cationic alpha-helical peptides; rich in hydrophobic and basic amino acids with no disulfide bond, and accordingly, it can be predicted to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helix secondary structure. In biological evaluation, xylopin exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and moderate mast cell degranulation and leishmanicidal activities, but showed virtually no hemolytic activity. Additionally, the peptide was able to incorporate pores in artificial lipid bilayers of azolectin, confirming the mechanism of the cytolytic activity by pore formation in biological membranes. Conclusions: LC-ESI-MS and MS/MS analysis of the crude venom extract from a solitary bee Xylocopa appendiculata circumvolans revealed that the component profile of this venom mostly consisted of small peptides. The major peptide components, xylopin and xylopinin, were purified and characterized in a conventional manner. Their chemical and biological characteristics, belonging to linear cationic alpha-helical peptides, are similar to the known solitary bee venom peptides, melectin and osmin. Pore formation in artificial lipid bilayers was demonstrated for the first time with a solitary bee peptide.

Seed yields of white clover are, however, known to vary greatly, and organic yields are often considerably lower than conventional yields. Our aim in this study was to estimate the roles of pollinators, pests and different yield components for organic and conventional white clover seed yields. We surveyed pollinators (honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees), reared the main insect pests (Protapion fulvipes Geoffroy and Hypera spp. weevils) from flowers and measured the yield components (inflorescences per area, flowers per inflorescence, seeds per flower and weight per seed) in organic, conventional untreated and conventional insecticide treated plots in 27 white clover seed fields over two years in southernmost Sweden. Unexpectedly, densities of bees other than honey bees were higher in insecticide treated plots compared to organic plots, but pollinator densities were not related to seed set. The lower pollinator visitation in organic plots might have been caused by pest damage to the flowers, as P. fulvipes and Hypera spp. weevils were more common in organic plots than in conventional insecticide treated plots. The abundances of both P. fulvipes and Hypera spp. weevils were negatively related to seed set, with P. fulvipes being most damaging for seed set. Seed yield was considerably lower (42%) in organic plots compared to conventional insecticide treated plots, and this was driven by a lower (36%) seed set. Taken together, our results indicate that pollinator densities are not limiting yields in either conventional or organic white clover seed production, whereas P. fulvipes crop damage is an important factor limiting organic yields via negative effects on seed set. Research efforts to raise white clover seed yield with minimized environmental impacts should include a focus on integrated pest management of P. fulvipes, including the development of control methods accepted in organic farming.

J	Bouman, RW; Steenhuisen, SL; van der Niet, T				Bouman, Roderick W.; Steenhuisen, Sandy-Lynn; van der Niet, Timotheus			The role of the pollination niche in community assembly of Erica species in a biodiversity hotspot	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Cape Floristic Region; coexistence; floral traits; heaths; pollination niche	CAPE FLORISTIC REGION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; PLANT COEXISTENCE; APIS-MELLIFERA; SHARED POLLINATORS; SOUTH-AFRICA; HONEY-BEE; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; CONSERVATISM	Aims Closely related species frequently co-occur in plant communities. The role of niche partitioning for allowing their coexistence has been called into question, but most studies on community ecology neglect pollination as a niche component, and thus potentially underestimate niche partitioning. Here, we investigate the importance of the pollination niche for determining coexistence in a biodiversity hotspot. We specifically test whether co-flowering insect-pollinated species of Erica, the most species-rich plant genus of the South African Cape Floristic Region, are characterized by different functional floral traits and different specialized pollination systems. Methods Communities of co-flowering Erica species were studied at three sites in the fynbos biome in the Western Cape of South Africa. We focused on five species with flowers that conform to an insect pollination syndrome. We assessed whether floral traits important for pollinator attraction and mechanical fit overlap by comparison of scent (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry), colour (spectrophotometry and models of bee vision), nectar volume and concentration and corolla morphology. Pollinator partitioning was quantified by comparison of floral visitor profiles and pollinator importance, calculated as the product of visitation rate, number of flowers probed per visit and pollen load for each functional visitor group among species within communities. Potential effects of competition were assessed by comparing visitation rates both directly and using anther ring disturbance as a proxy for lifetime visitation. Important Findings Floral phenotypes differed among species within communities in all functional traits. Visitor assemblages were diverse, including ants, beetles, flies, honeybees, moths and solitary bees. However, the Cape honeybee, Apis mellifera capensis, was the main pollinator of all but one Erica species. Insect visitation rates were significantly lower for E. imbricata and E. calycina relative to congeners, but high rates of anther ring disturbance, which differed significantly in only two out of seven comparisons, suggest that long-term visitation rates are mostly similar among species that share pollinators. This study shows that coexistence of co-flowering insect-pollinated Erica species is not determined by specialization for different pollination systems. Pollinator sharing might rather lead to facilitation among co-flowering species, and floral constancy mediated by extensive interspecific floral trait variation might mitigate its potentially negative effects.

Do introduced honeybees affect seed set and seed quality in a plant adapted for bird pollination?	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Apis mellifera; Banksia ericifolia; Proteaceae; seedling performance; seed vigour	GREVILLEA-BARKLYANA PROTEACEAE; BANKSIA-ERICIFOLIA; APIS-MELLIFERA; AUSTRALIAN PROTEACEAE; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NECTARIVOROUS BIRDS; MAMMAL POLLINATION; NONFLYING MAMMALS; MATING SYSTEMS; AFRICAN PROTEA	Aims Worldwide, evidence suggests that exotic pollinators can disrupt plant mating patterns. However, few studies have determined if pollination by the honeybee Apis mellifera (the world's most widely introduced pollinator) reduces offspring quality when compared with pollination by native birds. The Australian Proteaceae provides an excellent opportunity to test the impact of honeybees in pollination systems that are adapted to birds and non-flying mammals. Methods We compared the frequency of flower visitation and foraging behaviour of birds and insects within seven populations of Banksia ericifolia. Banksia ericifolia is hermaphroditic and has large nectar-rich, orange inflorescences typical of bird and mammal pollinated species. For a subset of the study populations, we compared the quality of seed produced via an exclusion treatment (that only allowed invertebrates to access flowers) with an open-pollination treatment (potentially visited by mammals, birds and invertebrates), by measuring seed weight, germination rates (T-50), percent germination, seedling height after 14 days since the emergence of the cotyledon and time to emergence of the cotyledon. Important Findings Apis mellifera was the only apparent insect pollinator and the most frequent flower visitor, while the open treatment inflorescences were also frequently visited by avian pollinators, primarily honey-eater species. The foraging behaviour of honeybees and honeyeaters showed striking differences that potentially affect patterns of pollen transfer. Honeybees made significantly greater proportions of within cf. among plant movements and only 30% (n = 48) of honeybees foraged for pollen (nectar foragers carried no pollen) whilst all birds were observed to contact both stigmas and anthers when foraging for nectar. Despite these fundamental differences in behaviour, there was little effect of treatment on seed set or quality. Our data show that while honeybees appear to alter patterns of pollen transfer within B. ericifolia populations, they do not impact reproductive rates or performance of early life-stages.

J	Montalva, J; Sepulveda, V; Vivallo, F; Silva, DP				Montalva, Jos; Sepulveda, Victor; Vivallo, Felipe; Silva, Daniel Paiva			New records of an invasive bumble bee in northern Chile: expansion of its range or new introduction events?	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION			English	Article						Invasive species; Exotic bees; Pollinators; Corbiculate bees	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; TERRESTRIS L. HYMENOPTERA; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION; SAMPLING BIAS; DISTRIBUTIONS; APIDAE; PREDICTION; ACCURACY; VEGETATION	The Eurasian bumble bee Bombus terrestris Linnaeus has been used commercially for pollination of a large number of crop species worldwide. This species has become invasive in several countries where it has escaped into natural environments. This species has become naturalized in many zones of Chile and southern Argentina, and may potentially invade other regions and countries in South America. These naturalized populations of B. terrestris have been associated with rapid population declines of the native bee B. dahlbomii Gu,rin-M,neville. We report new records of the exotic bee B. terrestris in the Region de Arica y Parinacota in the far north of Chile, which includes portions of the Atacama Desert. We used species distribution models (SDMs) and multivariate analyses to evaluate whether these occurrences represent new escapes from managed colonies or natural dispersal of the species from its southern invaded range. These reports of B. terrestris indicate a northward expansion of this bee. In our analyses, these new areas of occurrences have environmental conditions similar to those observed in the species' southern invaded range, and our SDMs predict that B. terrestris dispersal through the Atacama is possible, although not likely given the occasional flower blooming in that region of Chile. These new occurrences in northern Chile reflect a potential for future invasion into other regions of South America by B. terrestris. Future surveys in the area should be intensified to evaluate if viable populations of this invasive species may become established.

Influence of landscape context on the abundance of native bee pollinators in tomato crops in Central Brazil	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION			English	Article						Buzzers; Cerrado; Ecosystem service; Exomalopsis; Fragmentation; Habitat loss; Halictidae	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; FOREST FRAGMENTS; LAND-USE; FORAGING RANGES; TROPICAL FOREST; EUGLOSSINE BEES; FRUIT-SET; CONSERVATION; SERVICES; APIDAE	Evidence shows that pollinator abundance has declined and, consequently, so has their services, which has possible negative impacts on ecosystem functioning. The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of landscape context at multiple spatial scales on the abundance of bee pollinators of tomato crops in Brazil. Pollinator abundance was obtained from tomato crops grown in a conventional system in the Cerrado region. Around each tomato field circular buffers of 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 km radius were defined. Inside each buffer the landscapes were manually classified into native and non-native cover and, the proportion of native vegetation, the relative largest patch size, and the distance of the nearest native vegetation to each field were calculated. Pollinator species were categorized into five groups: Exomalopsis, Centris, Bombus/Eulaema, Halictidae, and all buzz pollinators combined (Buzzers). The results showed that the landscape context influenced the abundance of the five groups of tomato pollinators. Bees with a smaller body size, such as Exomalopsis spp., responded at smaller scales, while bees with a larger body size, such as the Centris and Bombus/Eulaema groups, responded at larger scales. The abundance of all pollinator groups increased with native vegetation cover. Most groups showed higher abundances in landscapes with similar-size fragments. The results reinforce the recommendation for maintaining natural habitats around crop areas, even if fragmented, for the conservation of the tomato pollinator assemblage. These findings are valuable for planning landscape management in the studied area to improve bee conservation, ecosystem services, and food production.

J	Gonzalez-Varo, JP; Vila, M				Gonzalez-Varo, Juan P.; Vila, Montserrat			Spillover of managed honeybees from mass-flowering crops into natural habitats	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Agroecosystems; Apis mellifera; Blooming; Cross-habitat spillover; Landscape scale; Orange groves; Resource pulse	AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; WILD POLLINATORS; APIS-MELLIFERA; BEE ABUNDANCE; FRUIT-SET; POPULATIONS; SHRUBLANDS; BENEFITS; DYNAMICS; ECOLOGY	Mass-flowering crops (MFCs) and beekeeping are increasing across agroecosystems globally. Managed honeybees could spillover after the blooming of MFCs into nearby natural habitats, especially if hive numbers are associated with the cover of MFCs at the landscape scale. Nevertheless, this phenomenon has been largely overlooked despite the potential impacts of honeybees on local wildlife. We assessed this `MFC-beekeeping' association and honeybee spillover into woodland patches in 17 fragmented landscapes in SW Spain with contrasting cover of orange groves as MFC. Hive densities were almost four times greater in landscapes with high cover of orange groves and, after the orange-tree bloom, mean honeybee densities were eight times higher in woodland patches within these landscapes, as compared to landscapes with no/low cover. Seemingly, this spillover was resource-mediated since it mirrored the temporal changes in flower cover at habitat and landscape scales. Our study demonstrates for the first time a consistent spillover of managed honeybees from a MFC into nearby natural habitats. These findings are a warning about the potential detrimental effects of magnified honeybee densities on local fauna and flora, especially on wild bees.

Effects of competition and climate on a crop pollinator community	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Crop pollination; Honeybees; Bumblebees; Exploitative competition; Temperature	FLOWER CONSTANCY; HONEY-BEE; BUMBLE BEES; IMPACTS; TEMPERATURE; DECLINES; INSECTS; VISITS; APIS; SET	Plant-pollinator interactions are ubiquitous in nature where both wild and domesticated pollinators interact with wild plant communities and entomophilous crops. Honeybees are important pollinators in many crop systems, but recent declines in honeybee stocks in Europe and the US have caused concern about the sustainability of crop systems solely depending on honeybees. In addition, several studies have shown that honeybees might negatively affect native pollinator populations, bumblebees in particular. Here we have studied flower visitation to two raspberry farms and surrounding wildflower communities in SE Norway. Bumblebees were excluded from the raspberry field by means of exploitative competition from honeybees ( > 97% of flower visits in the raspberry fields were conducted by honeybees). More than 55% of the visits recorded in wild plant communities surrounding the farms were conducted by bumblebees, showing that bumblebees were present in the system. Pollinator taxa were affected differently by temperature; honeybee visits showed a unimodal relationship with maximum flower visitation activity at a temperature of 24.1 degrees C, while flower visits by bumblebees showed a positive, linear relationship with temperature. The effect of temperature was much weaker for bumblebees than for honeybees (similar to 2.2% of the variation was explained by temperature, compared to similar to 46% for honeybees). Farming practice affected flower visitation, as flowers within growing tunnels received fewer visits. However, the number of flower visits, also within the growing tunnels, was far above what other studies have shown to be sufficient for optimal pollination in raspberry. We conclude that the raspberry fields were sufficiently pollinated by honeybees but that the system should be considered vulnerable as it is solely dependent on this particular pollinator species. The honeybees were sensitive to ambient temperature suggesting that they might suffer more from future climate change than bumblebees.

Flower handling behavior and abundance determine the relative contribution of pollinators to seed set in apple orchards	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agricultural pollination; Apple orchards; Bee diversity; Ecosystem services; Flower-handling behavior; Functional traits; Pollination	BEES HYMENOPTERA; SPECIES RICHNESS; NATIVE BEES; FRUIT-SET; SERVICES; WILD; DIVERSITY; APOIDEA; VISITORS; PROVIDE	A growing body of evidence suggests that wild bees play an important role in agricultural pollination. It is very difficult, however, to accurately quantify the contribution of wild bees relative to honeybees in most crop systems. We quantified the relative contribution of honeybees and wild bees to the pollination of an economically important, insect-pollinated crop (apple). We use an empirical dataset to identify which of three functional traits (body size, pollen load purity, and flower handling behavior) contribute significantly to seed set. We find that flower handling behavior and abundance were the only functional traits that significantly predict seed set. When we take into account flower handling behavior and abundance, wild bees contributed significantly more to seed set than honeybees in the apple orchards we surveyed. Our findings suggest that land managers may benefit from focusing on supporting communities of wild bees, rather than investing in honeybee hive rental.	[Russo, L.; Danforth, B.

Here we assess the relationships between landscape context, pollinator communities (density and diversity) and pollination of oilseed rape in 18 landscapes with proportions of small-holder farming ranging from 10% to 70% in southern China. To quantify the contribution of pollinators to oilseed rape yield, we manipulated pollinator access in a focal oilseed rape field in each landscape using open and closed cages. The pollinator communities in the focal fields were sampled using pan traps. The abundance of wild pollinators increased significantly with the proportion of cultivated land, but the diversity of the wild pollinator communities declined. The responses of pollinator abundance and diversity to cultivated land were best explained at scales of around 1000 m. The abundance of the unmanaged honey bee Apis cerana was positively associated with the proportion of cultivated land, whereas the abundance of the managed A. mellifera was not. A pollination services index (PSI) was calculated by comparing the reproductive investment in seeds between plants with or without pollinator access. PSI was positively correlated with wild pollinator abundance, but not with the abundance of honeybee species. PSI was also not significantly correlated with the area proportion of cultivated land. Our results indicate that crop dominated landscapes with numerous small fields supported an abundant, but relatively species poor bee community that delivered pollination services to oilseed rape. Conservation of (semi-)natural habitats, however, is important for maintaining the diversity of wild pollinators.

J	Park, B; Nieh, JC				Park, B.; Nieh, J. C.			Seasonal trends in honey bee pollen foraging revealed through DNA barcoding of bee-collected pollen	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Pollen; Foraging; Seasonal; DNA barcoding	APIS-MELLIFERA; POLLINATION SERVICES; COLONIES; DECLINES; HYMENOPTERA; DISTANCES; RESPONSES; SELECTION; AFRICAN; APIDAE	Recent declines in the abundance and diversity of wild bee species have made it important to understand how introduced species such as honey bees contribute to pollinating native plants. In this study, we decoded the waggle dances of Apis mellifera pollen foragers and used DNA barcoding of bee-collected pollen over 17 months to characterize spatio-temporal patterns in recruitment behavior and dietary breadth in a diverse yet fragmented Mediterranean scrub environment. Foragers danced for small, nearby patches of pollen resources during the cool dormant season but danced for 1.6-2.7-fold more distant and more widely dispersed resources during the hot dry season, a time of seasonal drought and floral dearth. Individual foragers collected pollen from a wide variety of species, but colonies focused recruitment on a small subset of common species in flower during each season: 2.7, 6.3, and 10% of all species in bloom during the dormant, growth, and dry seasons, respectively. Pollen foragers danced almost exclusively for cold-adapted native species during the dormant season, equally for native and non-native plants during the short growth season, and primarily for non-native ornamental species during the dry season. Our results suggest that honey bee recruitment behavior and dietary breadth may be influenced by seasonal changes in pollen resources. Furthermore, they indicate that honey bees may be useful in pollinating common native plants, and that non-native ornamental species can provide a major source of colony protein during a seasonal dearth of flowering native species.

Bee visitation rates to cultivated sunflowers increase with the amount and accessibility of nectar sugars	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Apoidea; bumble bee; corolla; Helianthus; honey bee; pollen	BUMBLEBEES BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; HELIANTHUS-ANNUUS; POLLINATOR ACTIVITY; FLOWER COLOR; MALE-STERILE; SEED YIELD; HYMENOPTERA; POLLEN	Pollinators make foraging decisions based on numerous floral traits, including nectar and pollen rewards, and associated visual and olfactory cues. For insect-pollinated crops, identifying and breeding for attractive floral traits may increase yields. In this study, we examined floral trait variation within cultivated sunflowers and its effects on bee foraging behaviours. Over 2years, we planted different sunflower inbred lines, including male-fertile and male-sterile lines, and measured nectar volume, nectar sugar concentration and composition, and corolla length. During bloom, we recorded visits by both managed honey bees and wild bees. We then examined consistency in relative nectar production by comparing field results to those from a greenhouse experiment. Sunflower inbred lines varied significantly in all floral traits, including the amount and composition of nectar sugars, and in corolla length. Both wild bee and honey bee visits significantly increased with nectar sugar amount and decreased with corolla length, but appeared unaffected by nectar sugar composition. While wild bees made more visits to sunflowers providing pollen (male-fertile), honey bees preferred plants without pollen (male-sterile). Differences in nectar quantity among greenhouse-grown sunflower lines were similar to those measured in the field, and bumble bees preferentially visited lines with more nectar in greenhouse observations. Our results show that sunflowers with greater quantities of nectar sugar and shorter corollas receive greater pollination services from both managed and wild bees. Selecting for these traits could thus increase sunflower crop yields and provide greater floral resources for bees.	[Mallinger, R. E.; Prasifka, J.

In Saudi Arabia, preliminary data indicated high infestation levels in the exotic honeybee colonies; such as Apis mellifera carnica and Apis mellifera ligustica, compared to native honeybee subspecies Apis mellifera jemenitica, which may imply higher tolerance to Varroasis. In this study, fertility and reproductive rate of Varroa mite, Varroa destructor, in capped brood cells of the native honeybee subspecies were investigated and compared with an exotic honeybee subspecies, A. m. carnica. Mite fertility was almost alike (87.5% and 89.4%) in the native and craniolan colonies respectively. Similarly, results did not show significant differences in reproduction rate between both subspecies (F = 0.66, Pr > F = 0.42). Number of adult Varroa daughters per fertile mother mite was 2.0 and 2.1 for native and craniolan honeybee subspecies respectively. This may indicate that mechanisms of keeping low infestation rates in the native honeybee colonies are not associated with Varroa reproduction. Therefore, potential factors of keeping lower Varroa infestation rates in native honey bee subspecies should be further investigated. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Pollinators and seed set of Anthyllis barba-jovis L.

The abundance and diversity of wild and managed bees are related to the availability of continuous floral resources. In particular, in Mediterranean basin countries, the presence of wildflower spots enhances the establishment of social Apoidea, since coastal regions are usually characterized by pollen and nectar shortage in early spring and late summer. Anthyllis barba-jovis produces both nectar and pollen as important food source for bees helping them to overcome early spring period food shortage. We investigated flowering, seed set, and pollinator diversity of A. barba-jovis in arid coastal environments of the Mediterranean basin. Pollinator abundance reached a maximum in early April. Honeybees were the most common pollinators followed by bumblebees and solitary bees. Plants prevented from entomophilous pollination showed inbreeding depression with a strong decrease in seed-set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on pollination ecology of A. barba-jovis. (C) 2017 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

In this study, the structural diversity of the gut microbial communities of native honey bees, Apis mellifera jemenitica from two different geographical regions (Riyadh and Al-Baha) of Saudi Arabia was analyzed by culture-dependent methods and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. In this study, 100 bacterial isolates were cultivated and phylogenetic analyses grouped them into three phyla: Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Bacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria were the most dominant (17 species), followed by Firmicutes (13 species) and Actinobacteria (4 species). Some of the identified bacteria (Citrobacter sp., Providencia vermicola, Exiguobacterium acetylicum, and Planomicrobium okeanokoites) were reported for the first time in the genus Apis, while others identified bacteria belonged to the genera Proteus, Enterobacter, Bacillus, Morganella, Lactobacillus, and Fructobacillus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the gut microbiota of the local honey bees in Saudi Arabia. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Three years of banning neonicotinoid insecticides based on sub-lethal effects: can we expect to see effects on bees?	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Neonicotinoids Conference of the Society-Chemical-Industry (SCI) on Are Neonicotinoids Killing Bees	SEP 22, 2016	London, ENGLAND	Soc Chem Ind, Agrisciences Tech Interest Grp		pollinator declines; exposure and dose; honey bees; neonicotinoids; pesticide ban	OILSEED RAPE SEEDS; HONEY-BEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; COLONY LOSSES; POLLINATING INSECTS; TREATED CANOLA; DECLINES; EXPOSURE; CLOTHIANIDIN; PESTICIDES	The 2013 EU ban of three neonicotinoids used in seed coating of pollinator attractive crops was put in place because of concern about declining wild pollinator populations and numbers of honeybee colonies. It was also concluded that there is an urgent need for good field data to fill knowledge gaps. In the meantime such data have been generated. Based on recent literature we question the existence of recent pollinator declines and their possible link with the use of neonicotinoids. Because of temporal non-coincidencewe conclude that declines of wild pollinators and of honeybees are not likely caused by neonicotinoids. Even if bee decline does occur and if there is a causal relationship with the use of neonicotinoids, we argue that it is not possible on such short term to evaluate the effects of the 2013 ban. In order to supply future debate with realistic (field) data and to discourage extrapolating the effects of studies using overdoses that are not of environmental relevance, we propose -in addition to field studies performed by the chemical industry -to use the ` semi-field worst case' treated artificial diet studies approach to free flying colonies in the field. This kind of study may provide realistic estimates for risk and be useful to study realistic interactions with non-pesticide stressors. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Country-specific effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on honey bees and wild bees	SCIENCE			English	Article							EXPOSURE; FIELD; IMPACTS; SURVIVAL; RISKS	Neonicotinoid seed dressings have caused concern world-wide. We use large field experiments to assess the effects of neonicotinoid-treated crops on three bee species across three countries (Hungary, Germany, and the United Kingdom). Winter-sown oil-seed rape was grown commercially with either seed coatings containing neonicotinoids (clothianidin or thiamethoxam) or no seed treatment (control). For honey bees, we found both negative (Hungary and United Kingdom) and positive (Germany) effects during crop flowering. In Hungary, negative effects on honey bees (associated with clothianidin) persisted over winter and resulted in smaller colonies in the following spring (24% declines). In wild bees (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis), reproduction was negatively correlated with neonicotinoid residues. These findings point to neonicotinoids causing a reduced capacity of bee species to establish new populations in the year following exposure.	[Woodcock, B. A.; Bullock, J. M.; Heard, M.

In this area, the endemic subspecies A. m. unicolor has been described in Madagascar. It belongs to the African lineage, one of the four described evolutionary lineages in honey bees. Despite a long beekeeping tradition and several recorded European introductions, few studies have been carried out on the diversity and proportion of honey bee subspecies. In order to identify and define which evolutionary lineages and potential sub-lineages are present in the SWIO, the COI-COII intergenic region and the ND2 gene of the mtDNA were sequenced in honey bee colonies from three archipelagos. An extensive sampling (n = 1184 colonies) was done in the Mascarene (La Reunion, Mauritius, Rodrigues), Seychelles (Mah, Praslin, La Digue) and Comoros (Grande Comore, Mohli, Anjouan, Mayotte) archipelagos. Islands genetic diversity was compared to newly sampled populations from Madagascar, continental African and European populations. Results: African lineage haplotypes were found in all islands (except for Rodrigues). Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles had 100% of A lineage, 95.5% in La Reunion and 56.1% in Mauritius. Among all African colonies detected in the SWIO, 98.1% (n = 633) of COI-COII haplotypes described the presence of the subspecies A.M. unicolor. Both genetic markers revealed i) a new private AI mitochondrial group shared by the SWIO archipelagos and Madagascar distant from continental populations; ii) the private African haplotypes for each island suggested diversity radiation in the archipelagos; iii) the detection of the Comoros archipelago as a possible contact area between insular and continental African populations. The exotic European C and M lineages were only detected in the Mascarene archipelago, but striking differences of proportion were observed among islands. Merely 4.6% of European colonies were found in La Runion whereas Mauritius cumulated 44%. Here, among the 84 observed COI-COII haplotypes, 50 were newly described including 13 which were private to the SWIO archipelagos and Madagascar. Similarly, 24 of the 34 found ND2 haplotypes were novel which included six haplotypes particular to the SWIO populations. Conclusion: A new African subgroup was described in the SWIO region with mitochondrial genetic evidence that A.m. unicolor is the indigenous subspecies of the archipelagos surrounding Madagascar.

J	Czerwinski, MA; Sadd, B				Czerwinski, Mitchell Andrew; Sadd, Ben Michael			Detrimental interactions of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and bumblebee immunity	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							HONEY-BEES; PARASITE EXPOSURE; INSECT; SYSTEM; IMPACTS; DETOXIFICATION; POLLINATORS; HYMENOPTERA; INFECTION; PATHOGEN	Pesticides are well known to have a number of ecological effects. However, it is only now becoming understood that sublethal exposures may have effects on nontarget insects of conservation concern through interactions with immunity, thus increasing detrimental impacts in the presence of pathogens. Pesticides and pathogens are suggested to have played a role in recent declines of several wild bee pollinators. Compromised immunity from exposure to widely used neonicotinoids has been demonstrated in honeybees, but further research on interactions between neonicotinoids and immunity in other important bees is lacking. In this study, adult workers of the bumblebee Bombus impatiens received 6-day pulses of either low (0.7 ppb) or high (7 ppb) field realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid prior to assaying immunity and survival following a nonpathogenic immune challenge. High-dose imidacloprid exposure reduces constitutive levels of phenoloxidase, an enzyme involved in melanization. Hemolymph antimicrobial activity initially increases in all groups following an immune challenge, but while heightened activity is maintained in unexposed and low imidacloprid dose groups, it is not maintained in the high exposure dose bees, even though exposure had ceased 6 days prior. Additionally, imidacloprid exposure followed by an immune challenge significantly decreased survival probability relative to control bees and those only immune challenged or imidacloprid exposed. A temporal lag for immune modulation and combinatorial effects on survival suggest that resource-based trade-offs may, in part, contribute to the detrimental interactions. These interactions could have health consequences for pollinators facing multiple stresses of sublethal neonicotinoid exposure and pathogens.

Physiological thermal limits predict differential responses of bees to urban heat-island effects	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						urban warming; climate change; bee; pollinator; critical thermal maximum; heat tolerance	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY; IMPACTS; TRAITS	Changes in community composition are an important, but hard to predict, effect of climate change. Here, we use a wild-bee study system to test the ability of critical thermal maxima (CTmax, a measure of heat tolerance) to predict community responses to urban heat-island effects in Raleigh, NC, USA. Among 15 focal species, CTmax ranged from 44.6 to 51.3 degrees C, and was strongly predictive of population responses to urban warming across 18 study sites (r(2) = 0.44). Species with low CTmax declined the most. After phylogenetic correction, solitary species and cavity-nesting species (bumblebees) had the lowest CTmax, suggesting that these groups may be most sensitive to climate change. Community responses to urban and global warming will likely retain strong physiological signal, even after decades of warming during which time lags and interspecific interactions could modulate direct effects of temperature.

Behavioral repertoires and interactions between Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and the native bee Lithurgus littoralis (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in flowers of Opuntia huajuapensis (Cactaceae) in the Tehuacan desert	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article						honey bee; native bee; agonistic behavior; competition	FLORAL RESOURCE; HONEY-BEES; REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; FORAGING PATTERNS; L. HYMENOPTERA; MASON BEE; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY	The introduction of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), into the arid environments of Mexico has affected the behavioral ecology of native bees. We described the behavioral repertoire and interactions between A. mellifera and the native bee Lithurgus littoralis Cockerell (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on Opuntia huajuapensis Bravo (Cactaceae) flowers in a semiarid environment. We filmed the bees in 150 cactus flowers to obtain the diversity of behaviors and their durations and thereby quantify the interactions. The behavior accumulation curve (Clench model) showed differences in the behavioral repertoire between the 2 bee species and between the sexes of L. littoralis. We found that A. mellifera and L. littoralis females invested more time in feeding behavior than L. littoralis males and recorded a wider repertoire of agonistic behaviors in male compared with female bees. Native male bees often perched in flowers and were inactive for long periods. The results indicate a possible interference competition between native and non-native bee species that are visiting the flowers of O. huajuapensis.

Using Publicly Available Data to Quantify Plant-Pollinator Interactions and Evaluate Conservation Seeding Mixes in the Northern Great Plains	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						native bee; honey bee; forage; plant visit; seed mix	WILD BEE ABUNDANCE; LAND-USE CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; HONEY-BEES; VISITATION; COLONIES; SERVICES; DECLINE; POLLEN; CROP	Concern over declining pollinators has led to multiple conservation initiatives for improving forage for bees in agroecosystems. Using data available through the Pollinator Library (npwrc. usgs. gov/pollinator/), we summarize plant-pollinator interaction data collected from 2012-2015 on lands managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and private lands enrolled in U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation programs in eastern North Dakota (ND). Furthermore, we demonstrate how plant-pollinator interaction data from the Pollinator Library and seed cost information can be used to evaluate hypothetical seeding mixes for pollinator habitat enhancements. We summarize records of 314 wild bee and 849 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) interactions detected on 63 different plant species. The wild bee observations consisted of 46 species, 15 genera, and 5 families. Over 54% of all wild bee observations were represented by three genera-Bombus, Lassioglossum, and Melissodes. The most commonly visited forbs by wild bees were Monarda fistulosa, Sonchus arvensis, and Zizia aurea. The most commonly visited forbs by A. mellifera were Cirsium arvense, Melilotus officinalis, and Medicago sativa. Among all interactions, 13% of A. mellifera and 77% of wild bee observations were made on plants native to ND. Our seed mix evaluation shows that mixes may often need to be tailored to meet the unique needs of wild bees and managed honey bees in agricultural landscapes. Our evaluation also demonstrates the importance of incorporating both biologic and economic information when attempting to design cost-effective seeding mixes for supporting pollinators in a critically important part of the United States.

J	Hokkanen, HMT; Menzler-Hokkanen, I; Keva, M				Hokkanen, Heikki M. T.; Menzler-Hokkanen, Ingeborg; Keva, Maaria			Long-term yield trends of insect-pollinated crops vary regionally and are linked to neonicotinoid use, landscape complexity, and availability of pollinators	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Brassica rapa; Carum carvi; Ribes nigrum; Pollination deficit; Pollinator decline; Finland	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BEE POLLINATORS; FORAGING RANGES; DECLINES; DISTANCE; IMPACTS; DENSITY; DEPEND; PLANTS	Time series data on crop yields for two main wind-pollinated crops (barley and wheat) and for three crops benefitting from insect pollination (turnip rapeseed, caraway, and black currant), were compiled from official agricultural statistics. In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.

Insights from measuring pollen deposition: quantifying the pre-eminence of bees as flower visitors and effective pollinators	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Pollination; Pollen deposition; Bees; Flower visit duration; Visit timing; Heterospecific pollen	WILD BEES; FLORAL VISITORS; FRUIT-SET; PLANT; CONSTANCY; SERVICES; BUMBLEBEE; HONEYBEES; HYMENOPTERA; PERFORMANCE	Using our accumulated datasets from Kenyan savanna, Mediterranean garigue, UK gardens and heathland, involving 76 plants from 30 families, we present detailed data to quantify the superiority of bees as pollinators of most flowering plants when compared with other flower visitors. Bees provided the majority of visits to study species at all sites, and 33 of the 76 plants received more than 90% of their visits from bees. Furthermore, pollen deposition onto stigmas from single-visit events (SVD, a measure of pollination effectiveness) was significantly higher for bees than non-bees at all the four sites where a major proportion of the flora was sampled. Solitary bees, and also bumblebees in temperate habitats, were the best potential pollinators for most plants in this respect, and significantly out-performed honeybees. Only a few plants were well served by bombyliid flies, and fewer again by larger hoverflies, butterflies, or solitary wasps. Bees also achieved better matches of their visit timing to peak pollen availability (measured indirectly as peak SVD), and made much shorter visits to flowers than did non-bees, permitting a substantially greater visit frequency. Additionally, they deposited significantly lower levels of potentially deleterious heterospecific pollen on stigmas in heathland and Mediterranean garigue, though not in the UK garden with densely clustered high-diversity flowering, or in the Kenyan savanna site with particularly dispersed flowering patches and some specialist non-bee flowers. Our data provide a novel and quantified characterisation of the specific advantages of bees as flower visitors, and underline the need to conserve diverse bee communities.	[Willmer, P.

Hunting for healthy microbiomes: determining the core microbiomes of Ceratina, Megalopta, and Apis bees and how they associate with microbes in bee collected pollen	CONSERVATION GENETICS			English	Article						Core microbiome; Hymenoptera; Pollen diet; 16S; Foraging ecology; Bacterial diversity; Enterotype; Pollen provision	DEVELOPMENTAL-STAGE; GUT MICROBIOTA; BUMBLE BEES; EVOLUTION; ENTEROTYPES; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; BACTERIA; ECOLOGY	Social corbiculate bees such as honey bees and bumble bees maintain a specific beneficial core microbiome which is absent in wild bees. It has been suggested that maintaining this microbiome can prevent disease and keep bees healthy. The main aim of our study was to identify if there are any core bacterial groups in the non-corbiculate bees Ceratina and Megalopta that have been previously overlooked. We additionally test for associations between the core bee microbes and pollen provisions to look for potential transmission between the two. We identify three enterotypes in Ceratina samples, with thirteen core bacterial phylotypes in Ceratina females: Rosenbergiella, Pseudomonas, Gilliamella, Lactobacillus, Caulobacter, Snodgrassella, Acinetobacter, Corynebacterium, Sphingomonas, Commensalibacter, Methylobacterium, Massilia, and Stenotrophomonas, plus 19 in pollen (6 of which are shared by bees). Unlike Apis bees, whose gut microbial community differs compared to their pollen, Ceratina adults and pollen largely share a similar microbial composition and enterotype difference was largely explained by pollen age. Megalopta displays a highly diverse composition of microbes throughout all adults, yet Lactobacillus and Saccharibacter were prevalent in 90% of adults as core bacteria. Only Lactobacillus was both a core bee and pollen provision microbe in all three species. The consequences of such diversity in core microbiota between bee genera and their associations with pollen are discussed in relation to identifying potentially beneficial microbial taxa in wild bees to aid the conservation of wild, understudied, non-model bee species.

The role of disease in bee foraging ecology	CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE			English	Review							BUMBLE-BEE; SELF-MEDICATION; HONEY-BEES; FLORAL PHYTOCHEMICALS; PARASITE; PATHOGEN; POLLINATORS; RESISTANCE; SERVICE; THREATS	Diseases have important but understudied effects on bee foraging ecology. Bees transmit and contract diseases on flowers, but floral traits including plant volatiles and inflorescence architecture may affect transmission. Diseases spill over from managed or invasive pollinators to native wild bee species, and impacts of emerging diseases are of particular concern, threatening pollinator populations and pollination services. Here we review how parasites can alter the foraging behaviour of bees by changing floral preferences and impairing foraging efficiency. We also consider how changes to pollinator behaviours alter or reduce pollination services. The availability of diverse floral resources can, however, ameliorate bee diseases and their impacts through better nutrition and antimicrobial effects of plant compounds in pollen and nectar.

Wildflower Plantings Do Not Compete With Neighboring Almond Orchards for Pollinator Visits	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Apis mellifera; honey bee; Prunus dulcis	WILD BEE ABUNDANCE; APIS-MELLIFERA; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; HONEY-BEES; CROP; RESTORATION; DIVERSITY; SERVICES	The engineering of flowering agricultural field borders has emerged as a research and policy priority to mitigate threats to pollinators. Studies have, however, rarely addressed the potential that flowering field borders might compete with neighboring crops for pollinator visits if they both are in bloom at the same time, despite this being a concern expressed by growers. We evaluated how wildflower plantings added to orchard borders in a large (512 ha) commercial almond orchard affected honey bee and wild bee visitation to orchard borders and the crop. The study was conducted over two consecutive seasons using three large (0.48 ha) wildflower plantings paired with control orchard borders in a highly simplified agricultural landscape in California. Honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) and wild bee visitation to wildflower plots were at least an order of magnitude higher than to control plots, but increased honey bee visitation to wildflower plots did not lead to any detectable shifts in honey bee visitation to almond flowers in the neighboring orchard. Wild bees were rarely observed visiting almond flowers irrespective of border treatment, indicating a limited short-term potential for augmenting crop pollination using wild bees in highly simplified agricultural landscapes. Although further studies are warranted on bee visitation and crop yield from spatially independent orchards, this study indicates that growers can support bees with alternative forage in almond orchards without risking competition between the wildflower plantings and the crop.

Monitoring these insects for research projects is often done by timed observations or by direct aerial netting, but there has been increasing interest in blue vane traps as an efficient passive approach to collecting bees. Over multiple spring seasons in Michigan and Pennsylvania, orchards were monitored for wild bees using timed netting from crop flowers and blue vane traps. This revealed a distinctly different community of wild bees captured using the two methods, suggesting that blue vane traps can complement but cannot replace direct aerial netting. The bee community in blue vane traps was generally composed of nonpollinating species, which can be of interest for broader biodiversity studies. In particular, blue vane traps caught Eucera atriventris (Smith), Eucera hamata (Bradley), Bombus fervidus (F.), and Agapostemon virescens (F.) that were never collected from the orchard crop flowers during the study period. Captures of bee species in nets was generally stable across the 3 yr, whereas we observed significant declines in the abundance of Lasioglossum pilosum (Smith) and Eucera spp. trapped using blue vane traps during the project, suggesting local overtrapping of reproductive individuals. We conclude that blue vane traps are a useful tool for expanding insights into bee communities within orchard crop systems, but they should be used with great caution to avoid local extirpation of these important insects.

Replication of honey bee-associated RNA viruses across multiple bee species in apple orchards of Georgia, Germany and Kyrgyzstan	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						ABPV; Apis mellifera; Bombus; CBPV; DWV-A; DWV-B; Pathogen; SBPV; SBV; Wild bee	DEFORMED-WING-VIRUS; APIS-MELLIFERA; TRANSMISSION; POLLINATORS; PATHOGENS	The essential ecosystem service of pollination is provided largely by insects, which are considered threatened by diverse biotic and abiotic global change pressures. RNA viruses are one such pressure, and have risen in prominence as a major threat for honey bees (Apis mellifera) and global apiculture, as well as a risk factor for other bee species through pathogen spill-over between managed honey bees and sympatric wild pollinator communities. Yet despite their potential role in global bee decline, the prevalence of honey bee-associated RNA viruses in wild bees is poorly known from both geographic and taxonomic perspectives. We screened members of pollinator communities (honey bees, bumble bees and other wild bees belonging to four families) collected from apple orchards in Georgia, Germany and Kyrgyzstan for six common honey bee-associated RNA virus complexes encompassing nine virus targets. The Deformed wing virus complex (DWV genotypes A and B) had the highest prevalence across all localities and host species and was the only virus complex found in wild bee species belonging to all four studied families. Based on amplification of negative-strand viral RNA, we found evidence for viral replication in wild bee species of DWV-A/DWV-B (hosts: Andrena haemorrhoa and several Bombus spp.) and Black queen cell virus (hosts: Anthophora plumipes, several Bombus app., Osmia bicornis and Xylocopa spp.). Viral amplicon sequences revealed that DWV-A and DWV-B are regionally distinct but identical in two or more bee species at any one site, suggesting virus is shared amongst sympatric bee taxa. This study demonstrates that honey bee associated RNA viruses are geographically and taxonomically widespread, likely infective in wild bee species, and shared across bee taxa.

OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Pollinators; Virulence; Virus; Bees; Longevity	COLONY COLLAPSE; GUT MICROBIOTA; VIRAL PATHOGEN; BUMBLE BEES; VARROA; PARASITES; IMMUNITY; TRYPANOSOMATIDAE; TRANSMISSION; INVERTEBRATE	Slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV)-previously considered an obligate honeybee disease-is now known to be prevalent in bumblebee species. SBPV is highly virulent in honeybees in association with Varroa mites, but has been considered relatively benign otherwise. However, condition-dependent pathogens can appear asymptomatic under good, resource abundant conditions, and negative impacts on host fitness may only become apparent when under stressful or resource-limited conditions. We tested whether SBPV expresses condition-dependent virulence in its bumblebee host, Bombus terrestris, by orally inoculating bees with SBPV and recording longevity under satiated and starvation conditions. SBPV infection resulted in significant virulence under starvation conditions, with infected bees 1.6 times more likely to die at any given time point (a median of 2.3 h earlier than uninfected bees), whereas there was no effect under satiated conditions. This demonstrates clear condition-dependent virulence for SBPV in B. terrestris. Infections that appear asymptomatic in non-stressful laboratory assays may nevertheless have significant impacts under natural conditions in the wild. For multi-host pathogens such as SBPV, the use of sentinel host species in laboratory assays may further lead to the underestimation of pathogen impacts on other species in nature. In this case the impact of 'honeybee viruses' on wild pollinators may be underestimated, with detrimental effects on conservation and food security. Our results highlight the importance of multiple assays and multiple host species when testing for virulence, in order for laboratory studies to accurately inform conservation policy and mitigate disease impacts in wild pollinators.

Less is known about the evolutionary consequences of interactions between species used in commercial agriculture and wild pollinators. Given population declines of many wild bee species, it is crucial to understand if commercial queens become established in natural areas, if wild bees visit agricultural fields and have the potential to interact with commercial bees, and if gene flow occurs between commercial and wild bees. We drew on a long-term data set that documents commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) use in New England, and we conducted genetic analyses of foraging B. impatiens from areas with varying intensities of commercial bee use. In agricultural areas with a history of commercial bee use we also sampled bees directly from commercial hives. We found significant genetic differences among foraging B. impatiens and B. impatiens sampled directly from hives (average pairwise F'(ST) = 0.14), but not among samples of foraging bees from natural areas (average F'(ST) among foraging bees = 0.002). Furthermore, Bayesian analysis of population structure revealed that foraging bees caught in areas with a history of commercial bee use grouped with samples from natural areas. These results document an agricultural setting where there was no widespread introgression of alleles from commercial bumble bees to wild bumble bees, commercial bumble bees did not become established in natural areas, and wild bees were providing pollination services to crops.

Neonicotinoids override a parasite exposure impact onhibernation success of a key bumblebee pollinator	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Diapause; hymenoptera; multiple stresses; pollinator health; trypanosome; virulence	PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; CRITHIDIA-BOMBI; HOST; BEES; VIRULENCE; TRENDS; FIELD; EVOLUTIONARY; INSECTICIDES; REPRODUCTION	1. Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators.

Unfortunately, native bees are declining in abundance and diversity. Much of this decline comes from human landuse change. While the effects of large-scale agriculture on native bees are relatively well understood, the effects of urban development are less clear. Understanding urbanity's effect on native bees requires consideration of specific characteristics of both particular bee species and their urban landscape. We surveyed bumble-bee (Bombus spp.) abundance and diversity in gardens across multiple urban centres in southeastern Michigan. There are significant declines in Bombus abundance and diversity associated with urban development when measured on scales in-line with Bombus flight ability. These declines are entirely driven by declines in females; males showed no response to urbanization. We hypothesize that this is owing to differing foraging strategies between the sexes, and it suggests reduced Bombus colony density in more urban areas. While urbanity reduced Bombus prevalence, results in Detroit imply that 'shrinking cities' potentially offer unique urban paradigms that must be considered when studying wild bee ecology. Results show previously unidentified differences in the effects of urbanity on female and male bumble-bee populations and suggest that urban landscapes can be managed to support native bee conservation.

The combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to thiamethoxam on the performance of bumblebee micro-colonies	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Bees; Neonicotinoids; Pollination; Pollen quality; Stressors; Bee health	BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDE; PROTEIN-CONTENT; POLLEN QUALITY; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; HONEY-BEES; HYMENOPTERA; CONSERVATION; DECLINE; FIELD	There is a pressing need to better understand the factors contributing to declines of wild pollinators such as bumblebees. Many different contributors have been postulated including: loss of flower-rich habitats and nesting sites; monotonous diets; impacts of invasive pathogens; exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids. Past research has tended to investigate the impacts of these stressors in isolation, despite the increasing recognition that bees are simultaneously exposed to a combination of stressors, with potentially additive or synergistic effects. No studies to date have investigated the combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to pesticides. Using queenless micro-colonies of Bombus terrestris audax, we examined this interaction by providing bees with monofloral or polyfloral pollen that was either contaminated with field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam, a commonly used neonicotinoid, or not contaminated. Both treatments were found to have a significant effect on various parameters relating to micro-colony performance. Specifically, both pesticide treated micro-colonies and those fed monofloral pollen grew more slowly than those given polyfloral pollen or pollen without pesticides. The two factors appeared to act additively. Micro-colonies given monofloral pollens also exhibited lower reproductive efforts and produced smaller drones. Although further research is needed to examine whether similar effects are found in whole colonies, these findings increase our understanding of the nicely effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural intensification on bee declines.

Natural products isolated from Tetragonula carbonaria cerumen modulate free radical-scavenging and 5-lipoxygenase activities in vitro	BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						Propolis; Tetragonula carbonaria; Inflammation; 5-lipoxygenase; Free radical-scavenging	AUSTRALIAN STINGLESS BEES; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITIES; POLYPHENOL CONTENTS; PROPOLIS; HYMENOPTERA; RESIN	Background: Propolis and cerumen are plant-derived products found in honeybees and stingless bees, respectively. Although propolis is an ancient folk medicine, the bioactivities of cerumen obtained from Australian native stingless bees (Tetragonula carbonaria) have not been widely studied. Therefore, we investigated selected anti-oxidant and antiinflammatory properties of T. carbonaria cerumen. Methods: A methanolic extract was prepared from the combined cerumen of 40 T. carbonaria hives, and HPLC was used to screen for chemical constituents that scavenged 2,2-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH). The ability of cerumen extracts to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and to interfere with leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) production in ionomycin-stimulated human neutrophils was also examined. Results: The extract dose-dependently scavenged DPPH (EC50 = 27.0 +/- 2.3 mu g/mL); and inhibited the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-mediated oxidation of linoleic acid (IC50 = 67.1 +/- 9.6 mu g/mL). Pre-treatment of isolated human neutrophils with the methanolic cerumen extract additionally inhibited the ionomycin-stimulated production of LTB4 from these cells (IC50 = 13.3 +/- 5.3 mu g/mL). Following multi-solvent extraction, the free radical-scavenging and 5-LOX-inhibiting activities of the initial cerumen extract were retained in a polar, methanol-water extract, which contained gallic acid and a range of flavonone and phenolic natural products. Conclusions: The findings identify free radical scavenging activity, and interference by extracts of T. carbonaria cerumen in 5-LOX-LTB4 signaling. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the extracts will provide therapeutic benefits for medical conditions in which oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated, including cardiovascular disease and impaired wound healing.

Managed Bumble Bees (Bombus impatiens) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Caged With Blueberry Bushes at High Density Did Not Increase Fruit Set or Fruit Weight Compared to Open Pollination	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bombus impatiens; bumble bee; highbush blueberry; Vaccinium corymbosum; pollination	VACCINIUM-CORYMBOSUM; RABBITEYE BLUEBERRY; CROSS-POLLINATION; SELF-POLLINATION; ERICACEAE; APOIDEA; CULTIVARS; SIZE; SEED; BLUECROP	Highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) is an important crop grown throughout Florida. Currently, most blueberry growers use honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) to provide pollination services for highbush blueberries even though bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have been shown to be more efficient at pollinating blueberries on a per bee basis. In general, contribution of bumble bees to the pollination of commercial highbush blueberries in Florida is unknown. Herein, we determined if managed bumble bees could contribute to highbush blueberry pollination. There were four treatments in this study: two treatments of caged commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) colonies (low and high weight hives), a treatment excluding all pollinators, and a final treatment which allowed all pollinators (managed and wild pollinators) in the area have access to the plot. All treatments were located within a highbush blueberry field containing two cultivars of blooming plants, 'Emerald' and 'Millennia', with each cage containing 16 mature blueberry plants. We gathered data on fruit set, berry weight, and number of seeds produced per berry. When pollinators were excluded, fruit set was significantly lower in both cultivars (<8%) compared to that in all of the other treatments (>58%). Berry weight was not significantly different among the treatments, and the number of seeds per berry did not show a clear response. This study emphasizes the importance of bumble bees as an effective pollinator of blueberries and the potential beneficial implications of the addition of bumble bees in commercial blueberry greenhouses or high tunnels.

Most studies that have investigated the effects of pesticides on honey bees have focused on the European honey bee (Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae)), which is commonly domesticated worldwide. However, the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) is widely distributed throughout Asia, and toxicity data are lacking for this species. This study aimed to fill this important knowledge gap. In this study, we determined the acute contact toxicity in A. cerana to various pesticides, including neonicotinoids, fipronil, organophosphorus, synthetic pyrethroids, carbamate, and anthranilic diamide. Based on the test duration of 48 h of contact LD50 tests, A. cerana was most sensitive to dinotefuran (0.0014 mu g/bee), followed by thiamethoxam (0.0024 mu g/bee) and fipronil (0.0025 mu g/bee). Dinotefuran is used extensively in Asia, thereby potentially creating a substantial hazard. More generally, A. cerana was approximately one order of magnitude more sensitive than was A. mellifera to most of the pesticides evaluated. The results of our study suggest that neonicotinoid pesticides should not be considered as a single group that acts uniformly on all honey bees, and that more careful management strategies are required to conserve A. cerana populations than A. mellifera.

Bee communities along a prairie restoration chronosequence: similar abundance and diversity, distinct composition	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						beta diversity; biodiversity; community composition; ecological restoration; native bees; pollinator conservation; tallgrass prairie	PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE; POLLINATION SERVICES; HYMENOPTERA APOIDEA; LAND-USE; CONSERVATION; RESPONSES; DECLINE; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; PERSISTENCE	Recognition of the importance of bee conservation has grown in response to declines of managed honey bees and some wild bee species. Habitat loss has been implicated as a leading cause of declines, suggesting that ecological restoration is likely to play an increasing role in bee conservation efforts. In the midwestern United States, restoration of tallgrass prairie has traditionally targeted plant community objectives without explicit consideration for bees. However, restoration of prairie vegetation is likely to provide ancillary benefits to bees through increased foraging and nesting resources. We investigated community assembly of bees across a chronosequence of restored eastern tallgrass prairies and compared patterns to those in control and reference habitats (old fields and prairie remnants, respectively). We collected bees for 3 yr and measured diversity and abundance of in-bloom flowering plants, vegetation structure, ground cover, and surrounding land use as predictors of bee abundance and bee taxonomic and functional diversity. We found that site-level variables, but not site type or restoration age, were significant predictors of bee abundance (bloom diversity, P=0.004; bare ground cover, P=0.02) and bee diversity (bloom diversity, P=0.01). There were significant correlations between overall composition of bee and blooming plant communities (Mantel test, P=0.002), and both plant and bee assemblages in restorations were intermediate between those of old fields and remnant prairies. Restorations exhibited high bee beta diversity, i.e., restored sites' bee assemblages were taxonomically and functionally differentiated from each other. This pattern was strong in younger restorations (<20yr old), but absent from older restorations (>20yr), suggesting restored prairie bee communities become more similar to one another and more similar to remnant prairie bee communities over time with the arrival of more species and functional groups of bees. Our results indicate that old fields, restorations, and remnants provide habitat for diverse and abundant bee communities, but continued restoration of old fields will help support and conserve bee communities more similar to reference bee communities characteristic of remnant prairies.

Long-term prevalence of the protists Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi and detection of the microsporidium Nosema bombi in invasive bumble bees	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article							HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; CERANAE MICROSPORIDIA; APIS-MELLIFERA; TERRESTRIS; PATHOGEN; PARASITE; TRANSMISSION; ARGENTINA; AMERICA; ATRATUS	An initial survey in 2009 carried out at a site in northwestern Patagonia region, Argentina, revealed for the first time in South America the presence of the flagellate Crithidia bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi, two pathogens associated with the Palaearctic invasive bumble bee Bombus terrestris. In order to determine the long-term persistence and dynamics of this microparasite complex, four additional collections at the same site (San Carlos de Bariloche) were conducted along the following seven years. Both protists were detected in all collections: prevalence was 2%-21.6% for C. bombi and 1.2%-14% for A. bombi. In addition, the microsporidium Nosema bombi was recorded for the first time in the country in the last two collections, at prevalences of 12.4% and 2.4% and unusually high infection intensities (Average=6.56 x 10(7) spores per individual). Due to the exceptional dispersal ability of the exotic B. terrestris, these three multihost pathogens should be considered as potential threats to South American native bumble bees.

J	Tepedino, VJ; Nielson, D				Tepedino, V. J.; Nielson, Dale			Bee-Rustling on the Range: Trap-nesting for Pollinators on Public Lands	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						crop pollination; illegal trap-nesting; solitary bees; sustainable ecosystem management; Tragedy of the Commons	DECLINES; SERVICES; TRENDS	A significant portion of world food supply depends on the action of pollinators, which for most crops are primarily domesticated and " wild" bees. Over 75% of pollinator value in the USA accrues through the actions of domesticated honey bees. However, the number of commercial honey bee colonies in the USA has been declining for seven decades due to parasitic arthropods, diseases, and various stresses. The recognition that honey bees, and the crops they service, are vulnerable has accelerated the search for alternative species of bees for pollination of selected crops. Foremost among potential alternatives are native solitary species such as Osmia lignaria propinqua, the "Blue Orchard Bee" (BOB), whose use as a pollinator of almonds, cherries, and apples is increasing. The BOB occurs on public lands managed by the USDA Forest Service, and the USDI Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service. BOBs are targets of " trappers" who place mostly unauthorized "trap- nests" of various designs on public lands. Several problems result from this "Tragedy of the Commons" situation: (1) the unsupervised removal of target bee species from their role in maintaining healthy ecosystems as pollinators of native plants; (2) the removal, as bycatch, of many nontarget species of bees and wasps that also employ trap-nests to rear their progeny; and (3) the shipping of these bees into areas where they do not occur naturally. We argue that unauthorized trap-nesting on public lands should be prohibited and offer several proposals to legalize commercial trap-nesting at a reduced level.	[Tepedino, V.

Of the 37 wild nests in pristine Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos in the Cape Point section of Table Mountain National Park that have been analyzed so far, only 22 could be accessed sufficiently to determine the existence of a propolis wall of which 68% had propolis walls which entirely enclosed their openings. The analysis of the 37 wild nests revealed that 78% occurred under boulders or in clefts within rocks, 11% in the ground, 8% in tree cavities, and 3% within shrubs. The analysis of 17 of these nests following a fire within the park revealed that the propolis walls materially protected the nests and retarded the fire with all the colonies surviving. The bees responded to the smoke by imbibing honey and retreating to the furthest recess of their nest cavity. The bees were required to utilize this honey for about 3 weeks after which fire-loving plants appeared and began flowering. Considerable resources were utilized in the construction of the propolis walls, which ranged in thickness from 1.5 to 40 mm (mean 5 mm). Its physical environment determines the nesting behavior of the Cape bee. The prolific use of propolis serves to insulate the nest from extremes of temperature and humidity, restricts entry, camouflages the nest, and acts as an effective fire barrier protecting nests established mostly under rocks in vegetation subjected to periodic fires.

Native bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) pollinators vary in floral resource use across an invasion gradient	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article							BROOM CYTISUS-SCOPARIUS; SCOTCH BROOM; SEED SET; POLLEN; VISITATION; COMPETITION; HONEYBEES; FABACEAE; BEHAVIOR; TRAITS	Integration of pollinator-dependent invasive plants into native pollination networks can have direct and indirect effects on local plant and pollinator communities. Impacts on local plants are well documented; however effects on native pollinators have gained less attention. We examine these issues in habitat fragments of the endangered oak-savannah ecosystem in British Columbia, Canada. We measured pollen collection by native bumble bees (Bombus Latreille; Hymenoptera: Apidae) and the introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus; Hymenoptera: Apidae) foraging on two common native plants in habitat fragments with varying invasive (Cytisus scoparius (Linnaeus) Link; Fabaceae) density. The Bombus species with the largest workers had higher proportions of invasive pollen on their bodies and in their corbiculae than smaller workers. Honey bees rarely collected C. scoparius pollen. While some native bumble bees species collect an increasing proportion of C. scoparius pollen with increasing C. scoparius density, this did not translate into an increased potential for pollination. Rather, measures of effective pollination decline with C. scoparius density. Overall, our results suggest that some bee species may be better at finding resources at highly invaded sites. Apis mellifera is likely not playing a major role in facilitating the spread of C. scoparius in our region. Rather C. scoparius is visited by a complement of native bumble bees that are similar to pollinators in the native range of this plant.	[Gillespie, S.

Pollination Reservoirs in Lowbush Blueberry (Ericales: Ericaceae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						agroecosystem; crop pollination; pollination reservoir; wildflower planting; wild bee	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; SOWN WILDFLOWER STRIPS; WILD BEE ABUNDANCE; ECOSYSTEM-SERVICES; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; VACCINIUM-ANGUSTIFOLIUM; HEDGEROW RESTORATION; FLORAL RESOURCES; DEPENDENT CROP; FIELD MARGINS	Pollinator-dependent agriculture heavily relies upon a single pollinator-the honey bee. To diversify pollination strategies, growers are turning to alternatives. Densely planted reservoirs of pollen-and nectar-rich flowers (pollination reservoirs, hereafter "PRs") may improve pollination services provided by wild bees. Our focal agroecosystem, lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), exists in a simple landscape uniquely positioned to benefit from PRs. First, we contrast bee visitation rates and use of three types of PR. We consider the effects of PRs on wild bee diversity and the composition of bumble bee pollen loads. We contrast field-level crop pollination services between PRs and controls four years postestablishment. Last, we calculate the time to pay for PR investment. Social bees preferentially used clover plantings; solitary bees preferentially used wild-flower plantings. On average, bumble bee pollen loads in treatment fields contained 37% PR pollen. PRs significantly increased visitation rates to the crop in year 4, and exerted a marginally significant positive influence on fruit set. The annualized costs of PRs were covered by the fourth year using the measured increase in pollination services. Our findings provide evidence of the positive impact of PRs on crop pollination services. Agricultura que depende de los polinizadores depende fuertemente de una especie-la abeja melifera. Para diversificar las estrategias de la polinizacion, los productores buscan alternativas. Una reserva de flores muy densa con una gran cantidad de polen y nectar (una reserva de polinizacion, en lo sucesivo la 'PR') puede que mejore los servicios de polinizacion por parte de las abejas silvestres. El agroecosistema focal, el arandano bajo, (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), crece en un campo sencillo que se beneficiaria de las PRs. En primer lugar, contrastamos la tasa de visita de las abejas a lo largo de tres clases de PR. Tenemos en cuenta los efectos de las PRs sobre la diversidad de las abejas silvestres y la composicion de la carga de polen de los abejorros. Cuatro anos despues de establecimiento, contrastamos los servicios de polinizacion al nivel del campo entre las PRs y los grupos de control. Finalmente, calculamos el tiempo para realizar ganancias. Las abejas sociales prefirieron los cultivos del trebol; las abejas solitarias prefirieron los cultivos de flores silvestres. En promedio, en los campos de tratamiento, las cargas de polen de los abejorros contuvo 37% de polen de la PR. Las PRs aumentaron significativamente las tasas de visita al cultivo en el ano 4, y ejercieron una influencia positiva y marginalmente significativa sobre el cuajado del fruto. Utilizando el aumento medido en los servicios de polinizacion, los costos anualizados de las PRs habian sido cubierto del ano 4. Nuestros hallazgos implican que hay un efecto positivo de las PRs sobre los servicios de polinizacion.	[Venturini, E. M.; Drummond, F. A.; Dibble, A.

Elevated temperature drives a shift from selfing to outcrossing in the insect-pollinated legume, faba bean (Vicia faba)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Allogamy; autogamy; climate change; extreme weather; heat stress; insect pollination; plant-climate interactions; plant-pollinator interactions; Vicia faba	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; HEAT-STRESS; FLOWERING PLANTS; BEE POLLINATORS; YIELD; LANDSCAPES; CULTIVARS; ABUNDANCE; SERVICES	Climate change can threaten the reproductive success of plants, both directly, through physiological damage during increasingly extreme weather events, and indirectly, through disruption of plant-pollinator interactions. To explore how plant-pollinator interactions are modified by extreme weather, we exposed faba bean (Vicia faba) plants to elevated temperature for 5 d during flowering, simulating a heatwave. We then moved the plants to flight cages with either bumblebees or no pollinators, or to two field sites, where plants were enclosed in mesh bags or pollinated by wild insect communities. We used a morphological marker to quantify pollen movement between experimental plants. There was a substantial increase in the level of outcrossing by insect pollinators following heat stress. Proportion outcrossed seed increased from 17 % at control temperature, to 33 % following heat stress in the flight cages, and from 31 % to 80 % at one field site, but not at the other (33 % to 32 %). Abiotic stress can dramatically shift the relative contributions of cross-and self-pollination to reproduction in an insect pollinated plant. The resulting increases in gene flow have broad implications for genetic diversity and functioning of ecosystems, and may increase resilience by accelerating the selection of more stress-tolerant genotypes.

At the same time, the gardens themselves are dependent upon the pollination services provided by insects. Thus, understanding the variables that can increase bee richness or abundance in community gardens can contribute to both urban agriculture and pollinator conservation. Here we examine the impact of several environmental variables on bee abundance and diversity in urban community gardens in Sydney, Australia. We used hand netting and trap nests to sample bees in 27 community gardens ranging from inner city gardens with limited surrounding green space, to suburban gardens located next to national parks. We did not find strong support for an impact of any of our variables on bee species richness, abundance or diversity. We found high abundance of a recently introduced non-native bee: the African carder bee, Afranthidium repetitum (Schulz 1906). The abundance of African carder bees was negatively correlated with the amount of surrounding green space and positively correlated with native bee abundance/species richness. Our results highlight the seemingly rapid increase in African carder bee populations in inner city Sydney, and we call for more research into this bee's potential environmental impacts. Our results also suggest that hard-to-change environmental factors such as garden size and distance to remnant forests may not have a strong influence on native bee diversity and abundance in highly urbanized area.

Bumblebee family lineage survival is enhanced in high-quality landscapes	NATURE			English	Article							AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; COLONY GROWTH; LAND-USE; HABITAT; CONSERVATION; POLLINATORS; RESOURCES; QUEENS; SCALE; BEES	Insect pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline(1,2). A major cause of this decline is habitat loss due to agricultural intensification(3). A range of global and national initiatives aimed at restoring pollinator habitats and populations have been developed(4,5). However, the success of these initiatives depends critically upon understanding how landscape change affects key population-level parameters, such as survival between lifecycle stages(6), in target species. This knowledge is lacking for bumblebees, because of the difficulty of systematically finding and monitoring colonies in the wild. We used a combination of habitat manipulation, land-use and habitat surveys, molecular genetics(7) and demographic and spatial modelling to analyse between-year survival of family lineages in field populations of three bumblebee species. Here we show that the survival of family lineages from the summer worker to the spring queen stage in the following year increases significantly with the proportion of high-value foraging habitat, including spring floral resources, within 250-1,000 m of the natal colony. This provides evidence for a positive impact of habitat quality on survival and persistence between successive colony cycle stages in bumblebee populations. These findings also support the idea that conservation interventions that increase floral resources at a landscape scale and throughout the season have positive effects on wild pollinators in agricultural landscapes.

Chronic exposure to a neonicotinoid increases expression of antimicrobial peptide genes in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BEES APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; HYMENOPTERA; NOSEMA; APIDAE; POLLINATORS; PATHOGEN; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR	Bumblebees are important pollinators in wild and agricultural settings. In recent decades pollinator declines have been linked to the effects of increased pesticide use and the spread of disease. Synergy between these factors has been suggested, but no physiological mechanism has been identified. This study examines the connection between neonicotinoid exposure and innate immune function in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens, which is an important wild and commercial pollinator in eastern North America. Experimental colonies in the field were enclosed and provided pollen and sugar syrup containing an agriculturally relevant range of imidacloprid concentrations. Bumblebees were collected from colonies over four weeks, and the expression of antimicrobial peptides was measured using multiplex quantitative real time PCR. Significant increases in the expression of abaecin, apidaecin and hymenoptaecin were found over time in treatments receiving moderate to high concentrations of the pesticide. Responses were dependent on time of exposure and dose. These results indicate that immune function in bumblebees is affected by neonicotinoid exposure and suggest a physiological mechanism by which neonicotinoids may impact the innate immune function of bumblebee pollinators in wild and agricultural habitats.

Gauging the Effect of Honey Bee Pollen Collection on Native Bee Communities	CONSERVATION LETTERS			English	Article						Apis; conservation reserve program; competition; pollinators; public land; resource depletion	SEX-RATIO; BODY-SIZE; SOLITARY BEES; HYMENOPTERA; RESOURCE; REPRODUCTION; BUMBLEBEES; IMPACT; APIDAE; COSTS	Experimental demonstration of direct exploitative competition between foraging honey bees and native bees in wildlands has proven elusive, due to problems of experimental design, scale, and context-dependence. We propose a different approach that translates floral resources collected by a honey bee colony into progeny equivalents of an average solitary bee. Such a metric is needed by public land managers confronting migratory beekeeper demands for insecticide-free, convenient, resource-rich habitats for summering. We calculate that, from June-August, a strong colony gathers as much pollen as could produce 100,000 progeny of an average solitary bee. Analogous to the animal unit month (AUM) for livestock, a hive unit month (HUM) is therefore 33,000 native bee progeny. By this calculation, a 40-hive apiary residing on wildlands for 3 months collects the pollen equivalent of four million wild bees. We introduce a rapid assessment metric to gauge stocking of honey bees, and briefly highlight alternative strategies to provide quality pasture for honey bees with minimal impact on native bees.

Yearlong association of Apis dorsata and Apis florea with flowering plants: planted forest vs. agricultural landscape	SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Honey bees; floral host plants; seasonal variations; conservation	LOWLAND DIPTEROCARP FOREST; ALLIUM-CEPA L.; POLLINATOR COMMUNITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CROP POLLINATION; POLLEN SOURCES; CONSTANCY; DIVERSITY; BEES; HYMENOPTERA	The yearlong association of two native honey bee species (Apis dorsata and A. florea) with 49 plant species was recorded in a planted forest and adjacent agricultural landscape at Multan, Pakistan. The study resulted in 588 interactions of A. dorsata with 40 plant species and 454 interactions of A. florea on 38 plant species. The most visited plants species by A. dorsata included Helianthus annuus, Citrus reticulata, Trifolium alexandrinum, Moringa oleifera and Calotropis procera, while the most visited plant species by A. florea included C. procera, Mangifera indica, T. alexandrinum, Coriandrum sativum and H. annuus. The peak abundance of bees and floral resources (i.e. number of plant species in flowering and abundance of floral units) was recorded during early March to late May followed by a gradual decline until December. Monthly abundance of both bee species was positively related to the floral resources, negatively related to relative humidity while it was not significantly related to temperature. The current study may serve as a baseline to track the degradation in ecosystem service of cross pollination and making new conservation strategies at local scale while future research should focus on tempo-spatial variations in foraging preferences, floral constancy and effect of foraging competition on crop pollination in different ecological regions of Pakistan.

First Characterization of Sphingomyeline Phosphodiesterase Expression in the Bumblebee, Bombus lantschouensis	SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Bombus lantschouensis; SMPDgene; gene clone; prokaryotic expression; polyclonal antibody; expression characteristics	NIEMANN-PICK-DISEASE; ACID SPHINGOMYELINASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; NEUTRAL SPHINGOMYELINASE; BACILLUS-CEREUS; NORTH CHINA; METABOLISM; DROSOPHILA; TERRESTRIS; WORKERS	The bumblebee (Bombus lantschouensis Vogt) is an important pollinator of wild plants. Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (SMPD) is a hydrolase that plays a major role in sphingolipid metabolism reactions. We report the preparation and characterization of a polyclonal antibody for bumblebee SMPD. We then use the polyclonal antiserum to detect the SMPD protein at different development stages and in different tissues. Our results showed that a 1228bp fragment homologous with the B. terrestris SMPD gene was successfully amplified. The molecular weight of the fusion protein was about 70kDa by SDS-PAGE. An effective polyclonal antibody against SMPD was also obtained from mice and found to have a higher specificity for bumblebee SMPD. Western blotting detection showed that SMPD was expressed at a high level in queen ovaries, although expression was lower in the midgut and venom gland. SMPD expression decreased from the egg stage until the pbl pupal stage. We interpret our results as showing that the development of an effective polyclonal antiserum for the SMPD protein of a bumblebee, which provides a tool for exploring the function of the SMPD gene. In addition, the work has confirmed that SMPD should be considered as an important enzyme during bumblebee egg and larval stages.

J	Kamper, W; Bluthgen, N; Eltz, T				Kaemper, Wiebke; Bluethgen, Nico; Eltz, Thomas			Bumblebee footprints on bird's-foot trefoil uncover increasing flower visitation with land-use intensity	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Pollination; Unsaturated hydrocarbons; Ecosystem function; Agriculture; Lotus corniculatus	POLLEN-LIMITATION; PLANT REPRODUCTION; CROP POLLINATION; EPICUTICULAR WAX; SCENT MARKS; LONGEVITY; SPECIALIZATION; EXTINCTION; POPULATION; RESPONSES	Wild pollinators aredeclining in abundance, diversity and richness and this puts the ecosystem function pollination at risk. Here, we investigated how land-use intensity and the three main components of land use used on the study sites (mowing, grazing, fertilisation) affect bumblebee visitation to bird's-foot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus, using a novel chemistry-based approach that overcomes the limitations of classical visitation monitoring. This approach uses the hydrocarbon footprints left behind by bumblebees that accumulate within the epicuticular wax of flowers. Along with land-use intensity, we investigated whether the small-scale (patch) population density and local abundance of L. corniculatus affected visitation. We found that the amount of footprints, and thus visitation, of bumblebees to L. corniculatus increased with land-use and grazing intensity while traditionally recorded visitation rates did not show such an effect. We further found that the patch density and local abundance of L. corniculatus had no effect on visitation. We conclude that bumblebee visitation to L. corniculatus increased with land use using the novel approach but emphasise that foraging decisions by bumblebees can be affected by many different parameters unrelated to the land-use intensity of a specific site.

There is growing proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4 ng/g (bee body weight) for individual pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There is virtually no information available on the strength of pollination services and the identity of pollination service providers from Asian smallholder farming systems, where fields are small, and variation among fields is high. We established 18 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields along a large geographical gradient in Jiangxi province in China. In each field, oilseed rape plants were grown in closed cages that excluded pollinators and open cages that allowed pollinator access. The pollinator community was sampled by pan traps for the entire oilseed rape blooming period. Results: Oilseed rape plants from which insect pollinators were excluded had on average 38% lower seed set, 17% lower fruit set and 12% lower yield per plant, but the seeds were 17% heavier, and the caged plants had 28% more flowers and 18% higher aboveground vegetative biomass than plants with pollinator access. Oilseed rape plants thus compensate for pollination deficit by producing heavier seeds and more flowers. Regression analysis indicated that local abundance and diversity of wild pollinators were positively associated with seed set and yield/straw ratio, while honey bee abundance was not related to yield parameters. Conclusions: Wild pollinator abundance and diversity contribute to oilseed rape yield by enhancing plant resource allocation to seeds rather than to above-ground biomass. This study highlights the importance of the conservation of wild pollinators to support oilseed rape production in small-holder farming systems in China.

AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ecosystem services; Ecosystem disservices; Pollination; Blueberry; Agriculture	FRUIT ABORTION; VACCINIUM-ANGUSTIFOLIUM; WILD BEES; CROP; HYMENOPTERA; FLOWER; YIELD; SET; AGRICULTURE; ERICACEAE	Pollination is frequently identified as an important ecosystem service to agricultural production. In contrast, ecosystem disservices are rarely considered. This study explores pollinator service versus disservice in lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) production. This crop is highly managed, requires insect pollination, and has a relatively long bloom; when combined, these characteristics may cause a portion of early season pollination to result in premature ripening and loss. To test this, we exposed early and late flowering clones to early season (wild) pollination only or late season (wild and managed) pollination only. Contrary to our hypothesis of disservice, pre-harvest loss, shatter, and sugar content were consistent across treatments, even though early season pollination plots exhibited heavier berries. Remarkably, early season pollination plots produced over 70% of the total production of late season pollination plots. These results suggest that early season pollination by wild pollinators does not present an ecosystem disservice to lowbush blueberry production. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Promoting diverse communities of wild bees and hoverflies requires a landscape approach to managing meadows	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agri-environment schemes; Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Life-history traits; Mowing; Pollinators; Semi-natural grassland	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; SOWN FLOWER STRIPS; FORAGING RANGES; BIODIVERSITY; POLLINATORS; BUTTERFLIES; SYRPHIDAE; RESPONSES; DENSITY; DIPTERA	There is ongoing concern regarding the observed decline in pollinator populations. Managing agricultural landscapes through agri-environment schemes (AES) supports biodiversity and could counteract pollinator population declines. We investigated whether alterations to current AES grassland mowing regimes would increase the abundance and species richness of wild bees and hoverflies. Furthermore, we investigated the response of different nesting and feeding guilds of wild bees and hoverfiies, respectively, to these regimes. The three experimental mowing regimes were: (i) first cut not before 15 June, before the beginning of summer (Swiss AES management, control meadows); (ii) first cut delayed until 15 July (delayed meadows); (iii) as for control meadows but leaving 10-20% uncut as a refuge (refuge meadows). The rationale behind the delayed and refuge mowing regimes was extending the availability of floral resources for pollinators, while also providing refugia for species that may be directly impacted by mowing. Hoverflies and wild bees were collected in 2014 and 2015, respectively, using pan-trapping and sweep-netting, once before and once after the first cut. The two collecting methods showed contrasting results. While there was no difference in the abundance or richness of wild bees between the meadows when using pan traps, following the first cut, sweep-netting resulted in a higher abundance and richness of wild bees in delayed and refuge meadows compared to control meadows. Pan-trapping detected a higher abundance of hoverflies in delayed compared to refuge meadows, whereas sweep-netting detected a higher abundance in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows, after the first cut. Saprophagous hoverflies were more abundant in the control and delayed than refuge meadows following the first cut, when sampled with pan traps. Predatory hoverfiies were more abundant and species rich in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows following the first cut, when sampled by sweep netting. Our study demonstrates that simple alterations to a common AES grassland mowing regime can enhance populations of pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, the contrasting response of the life-history guilds indicates that promoting heterogeneous management practices Within the landscape is important for supporting diverse communities, and maintaining key ecosystem services such as pollination and biocontrol.

Do sown flower strips boost wild pollinator abundance and pollination services in a spring-flowering crop? A case study from UK cider apple orchards	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Flower strips; Malus domestica; Pollination; Sustainable agriculture; Wild bees	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; FRUIT-SET; INSECT POLLINATORS; HABITATS ENHANCE; BEE ABUNDANCE; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; RESOURCES; POLLEN	Flower strips are widely recommended as a tool to boost insect pollinators and yield in pollinator-dependeht crops. Using UK cider apple orchards (Mains domestica Borkhausen) as a model system, we assessed whether flower strips increased pollination services in orchards. Pollinator communities (visual observation) and pollination services (fruit set) were assessed at increasing distance from surrounding semi-natural habitats (0-200 m) in eight orchards. In four orchards, perennial flower strips had been established and bloomed in the year before the main experiment. In a separate experiment, insect visits to apple flowers were observed to investigate possible functional mechanisms underpinning pollinator efficacy. The visit rate of wild insects to apple flowers (non-Apis bees and flies), but not that of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.), increased by 40% in flower strip orchards compared to control orchards, particularly in areas close to semi-natural habitat (<100 m). Wild insect visitation was also positively related to dandelion (Taraxacum species) abundance in orchards. Fruit set in orchards was positively related to wild insect richness, and andrenid bee (Andrena species) visitation, but neither richness nor andrenid bee visit rate responded positively to flower strips. Wild bees (andrenid bees and bumblebees (Bombus species)) contacted apple stigma (95 and 100% of visits) more often than honeybees (81%), but only bumblebees moved frequently between different tree rows, an important trait for transfer of compatible pollen in apples. Our results demonstrate that flower strips enhanced overall wild insect abundance but not pollination services in cider orchards. Positive effects of ground flora on wild insect abundance in orchards suggest that flower mixtures or orchard management could be optimised for andrenid bees, the single most important pollinator taxa, by increasing the availability of early-flowering plants in orchards. Equally, wild insect richness was highest in areas close to semi-natural habitats. Therefore, whilst flower strips can boost abundance of the existing species pool, only large scale preservation of (semi-) natural habitat will maintain pollinator diversity in apple orchards.

Climate change threatens pollination services in tomato crops in Brazil	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Solanum lycopersicum; Pollinator; Modeling; Ecosystem services; Species conservation	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; LAND-USE; FUTURE SCENARIOS; SOLITARY BEE; FRUIT-SET; DIVERSITY; YIELD; PATTERNS; DECLINES; INCREASE	Understanding how climate change may affect species distribution helps predict how ecosystem services, such as pollination, could be impaired in the future. We examine the potential consequences of climate change on the geographical distribution of five native bee species and estimate the possible effects of bee distribution shifts on tomato crops in Brazil. Ensemble forecasting was implemented through five algorithms in two carbon emission scenarios to predict range shifts for five tomato-visiting bee species for the year 2100. We then calculated the total tomato crop area in the cells with at least 50% bee suitability, for each bee species, in each scenario. Results showed that all species will undergo a reduction in suitable areas in both scenarios. Bombus mono had the greatest area reduction in 2100 under the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios: near 38% and 71%, respectively. Centris tarsata had the smaller area reduction under the same scenarios: 8.5% and 19.5% respectively. The high agreement between tomato crops and bee distribution observed in the present will also be reduced in both Scenarios for all species, especially in the pessimistic scenario. B. mono had the highest reduction in range due to habitat suitability and will be restricted to some parts of southeastern and southern Brazil. Over 60% of the tomato crop area presently within the distribution of B. mono will become climatically unsuitable in the pessimistic emission scenario. This study indicates that the predicted climate change may negatively impact several species associated with tomato crops in Brazil by the year 2100. This is troubling, as it could result in tomato production losses, which would bring economic and environmental losses to the tomato-producing regions with implications for pollinator conservation.

J	Eeraerts, M; Meeus, I; Van Den Berge, S; Smagghe, G				Eeraerts, Maxime; Meeus, Ivan; Van Den Berge, Sanne; Smagghe, Guy			Landscapes with high intensive fruit cultivation reduce wild pollinator services to sweet cherry	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agricultural intensification; Pollinators; Diversity; Ecosystem service; Fruit set	MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; ENHANCE POLLINATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; BEE POLLINATORS; NATIVE BEES; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; INTENSIFICATION; HABITATS; DECLINES	Fruit cultivation highly depends on insect pollination for fruit development. Yet, fruit cultivation as an intensive land use can possibly alter the diversity of pollinator communities and the corresponding pollination service. In this study we investigate how intensive fruit cultivation influences both pollinator diversity and fruit set in sweet cherry orchards in Flanders, Belgium. Negative relations were detected between intensive fruit cultivation within 250 m around the orchards and both pollinator species richness and wild pollinator abundance. Honeybee abundance on cherry blossom was positively related with intensive fruit cultivation within 1000 m. Sweet cherry fruit set decreased with increasing intensive fruit cultivation within 250 m and 1000 m around the orchards. These findings suggest that intensive land use such as intensive fruit cultivation can undermine the pollination service of wild pollinators. In addition, the loss of this pollination service was not compensated by honeybees. In these intensive agricultural landscapes the production of sweet cherry is below the optimum, inducing a clear yield gap. In order to gain the full benefit of intensive agriculture, the pollination service needs to be optimised. Landscape-scale measures need to be taken, such as conservation of semi-natural habitat to improve nesting and flowering resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Consequently, declines in bumble bee populations in many regions around the globe are cause for concern. We monitored abundance of 22 bumble bee species at multiple elevations over 5 years in Boulder County, Colorado. While no declines in abundance of any species were apparent over the course of the study, such a finding does not preclude prior declines in abundance. This study provides current baseline abundance data that can be used for future monitoring projects.

Here, we tested for increased compatibility under a mate limitation scenario after long-distance dispersal of the tristylous Oxalis pes-caprae, a South African geophyte invasive in regions with Mediterranean climate. We investigated variation in the expression of the trimorphic incompatibility system in plants from 16 native populations covering the entire distribution range in South Africa, and 18 invasive populations from the western Mediterranean basin by performing controlled hand-pollinations. After legitimate pollinations, native plants had higher fruit and seed set than invasives, while after illegitimate pollinations (self- and intramorph pollinations), invasives were more successful than natives. We detected morph-specific differences in the weakening of the incompatibility system and within population variability in the expression of the incompatibility reactions for invasive plants. Additionally, the offspring obtained after illegitimate pollinations was able to germinate, survive and flower under glasshouse conditions. Our results provide experimental evidence for differences in the expression of the incompatibility system between native and invasive populations of O. pes-caprae after introduction and under strong compatible mate's limitation. The weakening in the ificompatibility system reported here for the L- and M-morphs might possibly constitute an additional strategy for reproductive assurance in the invaded range of the Mediterranean basin.

Although they have long been studied as models for social evolution, recent challenges to bee health (mainly diseases and pesticides) have gathered the attention of both public and research communities. Genome sequences of twelve bee species are now complete or under progress, facilitating the application of additional 'omic technologies. Here, we review recent developments in honey bee and native bee research in the genomic era. We discuss the progress in genome sequencing and functional annotation, followed by the enabled comparative genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics applications regarding social evolution and health. Finally, we end with comments on future challenges in the postgenomic era.

The Complex Demographic History and Evolutionary Origin of the Western Honey Bee, Apis Mellifera	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						genomics; population genetics; ancestry; Apis mellifera	POLLINATORS; HYMENOPTERA; ANCIENT; AFRICA	The western honey bee, Apis mellifera, provides critical pollination services to agricultural crops worldwide. However, despite substantial interest and prior investigation, the early evolution and subsequent diversification of this important pollinator remain uncertain. The primary hypotheses place the origin of A. mellifera in either Asia or Africa, with subsequent radiations proceeding from one of these regions. Here, we use two publicly available whole-genome data sets plus newly sequenced genomes and apply multiple population genetic analysis methods to investigate the patterns of ancestry and admixture in native honey bee populations from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The combination of these data sets is critical to the analyses, as each contributes samples from geographic locations lacking in the other, thereby producing the most complete set of honey bee populations available to date. We find evidence supportingan origin of A. mellifera in the Middle Eastor North Eastern Africa, with the A and Ylineages representing the earliest branching lineages. This finding has similarities with multiple contradictory hypotheses and represents a disentangling of genetic relationships, geographic proximity, and secondary contact to produce a more accurate picture of the origins of A. mellifera. We also investigate how previous studies came to their various conclusions based on incomplete sampling of populations, and illustrate the importance of complete sampling in understanding evolutionary processes.

J	Brown, J; York, A; Christie, F; McCarthy, M				Brown, Julian; York, Alan; Christie, Fiona; McCarthy, Michael			Effects of fire on pollinators and pollination	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Review						conceptual model; fire management; fire regimes; flowering plants; phenotypic traits; plant-pollinator interactions; pollination; pollinators	BEE COMMUNITIES; FLOWER VISITATION; MUTUALISMS MATTER; WILD BEES; PLANT; DIVERSITY; SEASON; HABITAT; RESPONSES; BIODIVERSITY	Increased incidence of landscape fire and pollinator declines with co-extinctions of dependent plant species are both globally significant. Fire can alter species distributions, but its effects on plant-pollinator interactions are poorly understood so its present and future role in coupled plant-pollinator declines cannot be assessed. We develop a conceptual model of fire effects on plant-pollinator interactions. We review the empirical literature in the context of this model to identify important knowledge gaps regarding the processes underlying these effects and the phenotypic traits of flowering plants and pollinators mediating these effects. Fire generates, and plant-pollinator interactions respond to, heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. There is evidence of local-scale fire effects on these interactions, but landscape-scale effects are poorly understood. Nest location and floral resource utilization primarily mediate pollinator survival during and after fire. Voltinism and mobility traits are potentially important, but poorly studied. Plant traits mediating flowering responses to fire include growth form, phenology and potentially bud location, seasonal changes in bud exposure and response to bud damage.Synthesis and applications. We suggest management actions and an agenda for future research to fill knowledge gaps currently inhibiting predictions of fire effects on plant-pollinator interactions. Fire regimes promoting floral diversity at local scales provide a surrogate means of managing pollinators and pollination while empirical research continues. Above-ground nesting, univoltine pollinators may be particularly vulnerable under expected fire regime changes. Improved knowledge of traits mediating the exploitation of landscape heterogeneity could be used to enhance the persistence of these species. Ultimately, our conceptual framework could be used as a basis for understanding fire effects on aggregate network properties to inform fire management strategies buffering plant-pollinator networks against secondary species extinctions.

Concerns at these declines have led to the development of flower-rich agri-environment schemes as a way to enhance bee diversity and abundance. Whilst the effect of these schemes on bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) has been well studied, their impact on the wider bee community is poorly understood. We used direct observations of foraging bees and pollen load analysis to quantify the relative contribution that sown flowers (i.e. those included in agri-environment scheme seed mixes) make to the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on Higher Level Stewardship farms (HLS) implementing pollinator-focused schemes and on Entry Level Stewardship farms (ELS) without such schemes in southern England, UK. HLS management significantly increased floral abundance, and as the abundance of sown flowers increased, these sown plants were utilized for pollen by a greater proportion of the solitary bee species present. However, the overall proportion of pollen collected from sown plants was low for both direct observations (270%) and pollen load analysis (233%). At most only 25 of the 72 observed species of solitary bee (347%) were recorded utilizing sown plants to a meaningful degree. The majority of solitary bee species did not collect pollen from flower species sown for pollinators. Total bee species richness was significantly associated with plant species richness, but there was no difference in the total species richness of either bee or flowering plant species between HLS and ELS farms.Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the majority of solitary bee species present on farmland in the south-east of England collect most of their pollen from plants that persist unaided in the wider environment, and not from those included in agri-environment schemes focused on pollinators. If diverse bee communities are to be maintained on farmland, existing schemes should contain an increased number of flowering plant species and additional schemes that increase the diversity of flowering plants in complementary habitats should be studied and trialled.

Sublethal exposure to neonicotinoids and related side effects on insect pollinators: honeybees, bumblebees, and solitary bees	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION			English	Review						Neonicotinoids; Bees; Risk assessment; Sublethal effects	APIS-MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; APIDAE COLONY HEALTH; SEED-TREATED CANOLA; LEARNING PERFORMANCES; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; FORAGING ACTIVITY; RISK-ASSESSMENT; NOSEMA-CERANAE; CLOTHIANIDIN	Nowadays, there are increasing concerns about the bioavailability of neonicotinoids in the environment and possible exposure of nontarget organisms to these insecticides, their residues having been detected at different concentrations in many matrices, i.e., pollen, nectar, soil, water. Regarding the risk assessment process, there are still some information gaps about the exposure pathways and the possibility of various sublethal effects on insect pollinators. Recently, a clear rapprochement between the sublethal effects of different endpoints under laboratory conditions and field-realistic exposure level has been demonstrated. Here, we attempt to draw general portrayal about the current debate of the exposure to neonicotinoids and their impacts on pollinators. Depending on our extracted data from the published literature, we show that the lowest observed effect concentration under realistic field conditions in the most cases is higher than under laboratory conditions, which indicate that further long-term field research is required with consideration that our good understanding of the pollinators' responses to sublethal exposure should be taken into account in the future experimental design in order to establish vigorous conclusions. We review currently available information in the published literature, presenting the reports about detected residues in relation to multiple ways of exposure and their potential consequences on insect pollinators and community dynamics. Nevertheless, we attempt to classify the sublethal effects depending on the different biological levels from genes to population. Moreover, we consider the field-realistic exposure level and critically analyze the laboratory as well as field studies to specify their physiological and behavioral effects. Additionally, synergistic effects of different factors, including exposure to neonicotinoids and their hazards on bees, will find special attention.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Apis; Bombus; Osmia; Neonicotinoid; Trace metal; DEBtox	APIS-MELLIFERA; INSECTICIDES; HYMENOPTERA; SENSITIVITY; EXPOSURE; VULNERABILITY; TOXICOLOGY; APIDAE; ROUTE; RATES	Threats to wild and managed insect pollinators in Europe are cause for both ecological and socio-economic concern. Multiple anthropogenic pressures may be exacerbating pollinator declines. One key pressure is exposure to chemicals including pesticides and other contaminants. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an 'indicator' species for 'standard' ecotoxicological testing but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other types of eusocial and solitary bees because of species differences in autecology and sensitivity to various stressors. We developed a common toxicity test system to conduct acute and chronic exposures of up to 240 h of similar doses of seven chemicals, targeting different metabolic pathways, on three bee species (Apis mellifera spp., Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis). We compared the relative sensitivity between species in terms of potency between the chemicals and the influence of exposure time on toxicity. While there were significant interspecific differences that varied through time, overall the magnitude of these differences (in terms of treatment effect ratios) was generally comparable (<2 fold) although there were some large divergences from this pattern. Our results suggest that A. mellifera spp. could be used as a proxy for other bee species provided a reasonable assessment factor is used to cover interspecific variation. Perhaps more importantly our results show significant and large time dependency of toxicity across all three tested species that greatly exceeds species differences (>25 fold within test). These are rarely considered in standard regulatory testing but may have severe environmental consequences, especially when coupled with the likelihood of differential species exposures in the wild. These insights indicate that further work is required to understand how differences in toxicokinetics vary between species and mixtures of chemicals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High Elevation Refugia for Bombus terricola (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Conservation and Wild Bees of the White Mountain National Forest	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						Apoidea; Species of Greatest Conservation Need; Biodiversity; New England; New Hampshire	AMERICAN BUMBLE BEES; NEW-HAMPSHIRE; APOIDEA ANTHOPHILA; NEW-YORK; BEETLES COLEOPTERA; 40-YEAR-OLD FOREST; SOUTHERN ONTARIO; OLD-GROWTH; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE	Many wild bee species are in global decline, yet much is still unknown about their diversity and contemporary distributions. National parks and forests offer unique areas of refuge important for the conservation of rare and declining species populations. Here we present the results of the first biodiversity survey of the bee fauna in the White Mountain National Forest (WMNF). More than a thousand specimens were collected from pan and sweep samples representing 137 species. Three species were recorded for the first time in New England and an additional seven species were documented for the first time in the state of New Hampshire. Four introduced species were also observed in the specimens collected. A checklist of the species found in the WMNF, as well as those found previously in Strafford County, NH, is included with new state records and introduced species noted as well as a map of collecting locations. Of particular interest was the relatively high abundance of Bombus terricola Kirby 1837 found in many of the higher elevation collection sites and the single specimen documented of Bombus fervidus (Fabricius 1798). Both of these bumble bee species are known to have declining populations in the northeast and are categorized as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List.

Support for the reproductive ground plan hypothesis in a solitary bee: links between sucrose response and reproductive status	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						juvenile hormone; Nomia melanderi; proboscis extension response; Dufour's gland; gustatory response; reproductive ground plan hypothesis	DUFOURS GLAND SECRETIONS; DIVISION-OF-LABOR; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEE; JUVENILE-HORMONE; CONTACT CHEMORECEPTORS; PROBOSCIS EXTENSION; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; GUSTATORY RESPONSIVENESS; MACROCYCLIC LACTONES	In social bees, foraging behaviour is correlated with reproductive status and sucrose sensitivity via endocrine pathways. This association led to the hypothesis that division of labour in social insect societies is derived from an ancestral ground plan that functions to synchronize dietary preferences with reproductive needs in solitary insects. However, the relationship between these traits is unknown for solitary bees, which represent the ancestral state of social bees. We used the proboscis extension response assay to measure sucrose response among reproductive females of the solitary alkali bee (Nomia melanderi) as a function of acute juvenile hormone (JH) treatments and reproductive physiology. We also tested long-term effects of JH on reproductive development in newly emerged females. JH did not have short-term effects on reproductive physiology or sucrose response, but did have significant long-term effects on ovary and Dufour's gland development. Dufour's gland size, not ovary development, was a significant predictor of sucrose response. This provides support for the reproductive ground plan hypothesis, because the Dufour's gland has conserved reproductive functions in bees. Differing results from this study and honeybees suggest independent origins of division of labour may have evolved via co-option of different components of a conserved ground plan.

In many male insects, large eyes and eye regions of higher acuity are believed to facilitate the location of females. Here, we compare various features of male and female eyes in three sympatric carpenter bee species, which include two diurnal species (Xylocopa tenuiscapa and X. leucothorax) as well as a nocturnal species (X. tranquebarica). In X. tenuiscapa, males have larger eyes than females, while in the nocturnal X. tranquebarica, males have slightly smaller eyes and in X. leucothorax, the eyes are of similar size in both sexes. X. tenuiscapa males detect females by perching near nest sites (resource defence) or along fly-ways and other open areas with good visibility. Males of the other two species search for females by patrolling. We postulate that the larger eyes of male X. tenuiscapa are beneficial to their mode of mate detection since perching males may benefit from a larger visual area of high resolution detecting moving stimuli across the sky, and which may be germane to the more social and gregarious nesting behaviour of this species, compared to the other solitary bees. We tested the performance of the eyes of male X. tenuiscapa behaviourally and find that a perching male can detect a flying female at a distance of 20 m, which darkens the visual field of a single ommatidium by just 2%.

J	Fujiwara, A; Washitani, I				Fujiwara, Ayumi; Washitani, Izumi			Dependence of Asian honeybee on deciduous woody plants for pollen resource during spring to mid-summer in northern Japan	ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Apidae; Apis cerana japonica; deciduous forest; foraging habitat; Hymenoptera; landscape mosaic; pollination service	FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; APIS-MELLIFERA; FOREST; LANDSCAPE; CERANA; SET	Apis cerana japonica Radoszkowski, endemic to Japan, is known to be one of the most important pollinators for wild plants and crops, such as buckwheat, in cool to warm temperate Japan. To determine the degree of dependence of A. cerana japonica on forest resources, we analyzed pollen brought back to nests in a typical "Satoyama" landscape with relatively high deciduous forest coverage in northern Japan. We divided the landscape elements of the study area into three types: deciduous forest, conifer plantation and open land according to landcover digital data, and each pollen taxon was assigned to one of these three types of landscape elements. We collected total pollen loads of 15.75 g (total of colonies A and B) in May (spring), 1.57g ( total of colonies A and C) in June (early summer), 19.03 g (total of colonies A, B and C) in July (mid-summer) and 45.61 g (total of colonies A, B and D) in September (autumn). Deciduous forests are the most important foraging habitats for A. cerana japonica in the "Satoyama" landscape especially from spring to mid-summer when mass flowering of tall trees and shrubs species provides rich floral resources for developing bee colonies. On the other hand, the bees frequently foraged from herbaceous plant species in autumn when flowering of tree species reduces and herbaceous plant species have flowering peaks. In turn, the bees provide pollination services to a number of wild flowers blooming in various forest layers ranging from the canopy to the understory layer.

Bumblebees are the predominant wild pollinators for many plant species in temperate regions. A bumblebee colony requires pollen and nectar throughout its lifetime, but degraded and fragmented habitats may have gaps in the temporal and spatial continuity of floral resources. 2. Heathlands are open biotopes that provide favourable habitat for bumblebees like Bombus jonellus, a declining species in Belgium. In heathlands, ericaceous species are the main plants that provide pollen and nectar for bumblebees. Although the nectar composition of ericaceous species has been previously studied, data on pollen composition remain scarce. 3. We examined bumblebee diets (composition of their pollen loads) in Belgian heathlands over the course of a colony lifetime to assess the fidelity of bumblebees for ericaceous species. We compared nutritional values by investigating the chemical composition (amino acids, polypeptides and sterols) of the pollen of the ericaceous and dominant non-ericaceous species present in pollen loads. No relationship was detected between the abundance of a particular plant species in bumblebee loads and its pollen composition. 4. The successive flowering periods and the nutritional quality of pollen of ericaceous species offer valuable resources for bumblebees. Ericaceous species represent a large part of bumblebee diets in heathlands, especially in early spring and late summer when the diversity of other flowering species was low. 5. Bumblebee pollen loads also contained non-ericaceous flowering species that grow outside heathlands. Thus, land planning must incorporate conservation strategies for the different elements of the landscape matrix, including heathlands, peatlands, meadows and margins.

Range Expansion of the Small Carpenter Bee Ceratina smaragdula across the Hawaiian Archipelago with Potential Ecological Implications for Native Pollinator Systems	PACIFIC SCIENCE			English	Article							HYLAEUS NESOPROSOPIS HYMENOPTERA; EXONEURINE ALLODAPINE BEES; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; INTRODUCED HONEYBEES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; NESTING BIOLOGY; APIS-MELLIFERA; DISPERSAL; POLLEN; CONSERVATION	Invasive bee species may have a widely detrimental impact on their novel host ecosystem. Introduced bees can rapidly disrupt native plant pollinator mutualisms through competition with indigenous pollinator fauna and facilitation of invasive flora reproduction. Island ecosystems, which are inherently limited in physical range, resource availability, and trophic diversity, tend to be particularly sensitive to ecological impacts of invasive species. The small green carpenter bee Ceratina (Pithitis) smaragdula occurs throughout Southeast Asia and across the Hawaiian archipelago. Historical records indicate that C. smaragdula is nonnative to the Hawaiian archipelago and is recently introduced. Here we present a comprehensive synthesis of C. smaragdula's known biological and ecological history, as well as a population genetic analysis of C. smaragdula from Maui, and from locations across its native range, at the cytochrome oxidase I (C01) locus. We update C. smaragdula's known distribution and occurrence elevation in Hawai'i and reveal a lack of genetic structure between Hawaiian and native range populations. We discuss points of origin, means of introduction, and potential ecological impact of this nonnative pollinator.

The mitochondrial genome was 15,843 bp in length, with 37 classical eukaryotic mitochondrial genes and an A+T-rich region. Gene directions and arrangements were similar to those of other Apis mitogenomes. Most genes initiate with ATT (though ATG and ATC also were used) and all genes terminated with TAA. Nine genes were encoded on the light strand while four were encoded on the heavy strand. All 22 tRNA genes have a typical cloverleaf structure. The most likely phylogenetic tree showed A. nuluensis clustering with A. cerana. The complete mitogenome of A. nuluensis completes the sequencing of all mitogenomes of the currently accepted species of Apis.

J	Boyle, NK; Pitts-Singer, TL				Boyle, N. K.; Pitts-Singer, T. L.			The Effect of Nest Box Distribution on Sustainable Propagation of Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in Commercial Tart Cherry Orchards	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						blue orchard bee; commercial pollination; dispersal; Prunus cerasus; solitary bee	POLLINATION; APPLE; POPULATIONS; SUCCESS; YIELDS; BEES	The blue orchard bee, Osmia lignaria (Say), is a solitary bee that is an excellent pollinator of tree fruit orchards. Due to the annual rising costs of honey bee hive rentals, many orchardists are eager to develop management tools and practices to support O. lignaria as an alternative pollinator. Establishing O. lignaria pollination as a sustainable industry requires careful consideration of both bee and orchard management. Here, we test the effect of artificial nest box distribution on in-orchard propagation of O. lignaria in Utah commercial tart cherry orchards. Two nest box distributions were compared across three paired, 1.2-ha plots. One distribution, traditionally employed by O. lignaria consultants, included a centrally located tote for mass-nesting with smaller, surrounding 'satellite' nest boxes at orchard margins. The other distribution was composed of smaller, more equally distributed nest boxes throughout the 1.2-ha plots. Significantly higher propagation of O. lignaria was observed in the latter nest box distribution, although all treatments resulted in bee return exceeding the number of bees initially released. These findings provide support for the use of O. lignaria in tart cherry orchards, and demonstrate how simple changes to bee set-up and management can influence propagation efforts.	[Boyle, N.

The mitochondrial genome is a circular molecule of 15,855 bp, including 37 classical eukaryotic mitochondrial regions and an A+T-rich region. Gene directions and arrangements are similar to those of other Apis mitogenomes. Most genes initiated with ATT, though ATG and ATA were also used as start codons. Twelve of 13 protein-coding genes terminated with TAA, though ND2 terminated with TAG. Four PCG genes, eight tRNAs and both rRNAs were encoded on the heavy strand while all others were encoded on the light strand (9 PCGs and 14 tRNAs). Overall, the GC content composed 15.6% of the mitogenome. All of the 22 tRNA genes, ranging from 66 to 114 bp, have a typical cloverleaf structure. A phylogenetic tree showed that A. nigrocincta clustered closest to A. cerana.

True beekeeping began when humans started providing artificial cavities within which the bees could build comb for the queen to lay her eggs and the workers could process honey. By 2450 BCE, the Egyptians had developed sophisticated apiculture, and, within two millennia, beekeeping with horizontal hives had spread throughout the Mediterranean. During Europe's Middle Ages, honey and wax became important commodities for trade, and beekeeping in skep, log, box, and tree hives flourished to meet the demand. Other species of honey bees contributed to the development and spread of beekeeping in Asia beginning around 300 BCE. Meanwhile, beekeeping evolved independently in Mesoamerica with the stingless bee Melipona beecheii, as documented by archaeological finds and written accounts that survived Spanish conquest.

Pulsed light inactivation of the bumble bee trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi	JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						bumble bee; Bombus terrestris audux; Crithidia bombi parasite; pulsed light; disinfection; pollination industry	VITRO CELL-CULTURE; PATHOGEN SPILLOVER; PCR ASSAY; UV; POLLINATORS; THREATS; WATER; DISINFECTION; TRANSMISSION; TERRESTRIS	The anthropogenic movement of managed bees has led to the introduction and global spread of parasites with significant adverse effects on the health of both managed and wild species. This constitutes the first study to report on the use of high-intensity pulsed light (PL) for the inactivation of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi, a pest of wild and managed bees. Through initial PL range-finding studies we identified a putative effective UV dose of 12.96 mu J/cm(2) for C. bombi treatment. This was a result of tests on waterborne protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum, and was determined using in vitro combined cell culture-qPCR infectivity assays. This irradiance produced ca. >= 4 log(10) oocyst reductions of C. parvum. To confirm this dose as appropriate for treatment of C. bombi, we used the buff tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) as an animal infectivity model. C. bombi was collected from the feces of wild B. terrestris queens and used to inoculate 30 commercially supplied workers (B. terrestris audux) in order to obtain a colony-specific C. bombi inoculum. This was used for subsequent tests on 60 randomly-selected unparasitised workers, which were divided evenly and fed either PL-treated or untreated (control) C. bombi inoculant. Of the 28 surviving workers fed with pooled C. bombi untreated inoculum, 25 exhibited infection as confirmed by detection of the parasite in fecal samples after 9 days, where the remaining two did not excrete feces. Twenty-eight of 30 (93%) workers fed PL-treated C. bombi at 12.96 mu J/cm(2) under similar test conditions were uninfected after the same time period (the remaining two workers did not produce feces for testing). Thus we demonstrate for the first time, that PL is potentially a reliable and efficient technology for the non-thermal inactivation of C. bombi for the pollination industry. Although in vivo treatment of whole bees with PL is not possible, the use of this technology on equipment used in commercial bumble bee breeding facilities could potentially reduce infection rates, therefore contributing to making the industry more sustainable and less of a risk to wild pollinators.

Diversity of native bees on Parkinsonia aculeata L. in Jammu region of North-West Himalaya	TROPICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Diversity; land use pattern; Megachile bees; native pollinators; Parkinsonia aculeata; species composition	POLLINATION; BIODIVERSITY	A study was conducted in Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir State to determine the species composition and relative abundance of pollinators on Parkinsonia aculeata L., (Family Fabaceae) is a perennial flowering plant, growing as an avenue tree on roadsides. Parkinsonia flowers attracted 27 species of insects belonging to orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera. They included Megachile bicolor (Fabricius), Megachile hera (Bingham), Megachile lanata (Fabricius), Megachile disjuncta (Fab.), Megachile cephalotes (Smith), Megachile badia (Fab.), Megachile semivestita (Smith), Megachile vigilans (Smith), Megachile relata (Fab.), Megachile femorata, Andrena sp., Amegilla zonata (Linnaeus), Amegilla confusa (Smith), Apis dorsata (Fab.), Apis cerana (Fab.), Apis florea (Fab.), Ceratina smaragdula (Fab.)., Xylocopa latipes (Drury), Nomia iridescens (Smith), Nomia curvipes (Fab.), and seven species of unidentified insects. Megachile bees were most abundant and constituted more than 95% of the insects visiting Parkinsonia aculeata flowers. Species diversity measured by Shannon Wiener index showed a high value of H' = 2.03, reflecting a diverse pollinator community in the area. The foragers of all the species were found to be most active between 11.00 and 15.00 hrs and the population of flower visitors declined thereafter. Information on diversity of native pollinators from disturbed habitats and their specific dependence on P. aculeata during dearth period will provide a base for conservation of pollinators.

Pollination reservoirs for wild bee habitat enhancement in cropping systems: a review	AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Review						Ecosystem services; hedgerows; native bees; pollination services; wildflower planting	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; PROVIDING FORAGING RESOURCES; BUMBLEBEE NEST DENSITY; SOWN WILDFLOWER STRIPS; MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; FRUIT-SET; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; NATIVE BEES; ECONOMIC VALUE; LAND-USE	Pollinator-dependent growers seek alternative pollination models as pollination-security concerns grow. Pollination reservoirs, set-aside bee foraging areas, may offer growers a practical tool for increasing wild bee populations and decreasing reliance on managed bees. We review the literature on pollination reservoirs regarding a) effectiveness, b) reservoir-to-crop ratios, and c) costs and benefits. We discuss the relevant aspects of d) plant-pollinator relationships, e) landscape context, f) wild bees as pollinators, g) flower selection, and h) limitations. Recent research clearly suggests that pollination reservoirs can increase wild bee populations, crop yield, and profit. Last, we identify gaps that require additional research.

Origins and implications of apid bees (Hymentopera: Apidae) in French Polynesia	ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						biosecurity; food security; introduced species; invasive species; Pacific islands; pollinators	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; REUNION ISLAND; PACIFIC; HYMENOPTERA; DIVERSITY; ARCHIPELAGOES; CONSERVATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ECOSYSTEMS; PHYLOGENY	Island plant-pollinator networks are typically simpler than their continental counterparts and this can make them less resilient to disturbance from exotic species. French Polynesia has a very low diversity of bees, but their status as either native or introduced species has been largely speculative. We combine previous studies with new DNA sequence data to show that 11 bee species have now been recorded for French Polynesia. Haplotype variation at the 'barcode' region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) for four of these species, Ceratina dentipes Freise, Xylocopa sonorina Smith, Braunsapis puangensis (Cockerell) and Amegilla pulchra (Smith), indicates that they all represent very recent introductions. Apis mellifera Linnaeus was a purposefully introduced species, and four megachilid species probably arrived due to human-aided dispersal through maritime activities in the Pacific. The two remaining bee species, an unidentified partial specimen of a halictid bee and the colletid bee Hylaeus (P.) tuamotuensis Michener, are collectively known from only four specimens collected in the 1930s and their provenance is uncertain. French Polynesia therefore comprises a region where recently introduced bee species greatly overwhelm any possible native bee fauna. These introductions are likely to have major ecosystem impacts, including disruptions of existing plant-pollinator networks and facilitating the spread of weedy plant species, as well as positive impacts for agriculture. Future biosecurity initiatives need to consider these potential impacts and the likely routes of dispersal to effectively control any further unintended introductions.	[Groom, Scott V.

Risks and benefits of the biological interface between managed and wild bee pollinators	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Review						bees; biodiversity; eco-system services; interface; pollinators; resilience; resistance	APIS-MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA; VARROA-DESTRUCTOR; COLONY LOSSES; HONEY-BEES; NATIONAL-SURVEY; AETHINA-TUMIDA; NATIVE BEES; BIODIVERSITY; INFESTATION; POPULATION	1. Increasing global human populations and climate change not only increase the demand for food but require it to be supplied in sustainable quantities. One crucial aspect for sustainability is to ensure pollinator services for crop production and ecosystem services. 2. The global distribution of universal bee pollinators and the different degrees of intensity of bee-keeping have resulted in a high variability of impacts. It is therefore essential to separate the different pollinator populations, in particular the cases of honeybees and bumblebees, into wild/feral and managed populations, which can and will interact. 3. Such interactions can be either beneficial or deleterious. A deleterious interaction between wild/feral colonies and the managed populations may result in disease and pest transmission. 4. However, a wild/feral population could easily buffer the effects of newly introduced pathogens increasing the resistance of the population as a whole. Varroa mites that caused the loss of the wild population of Apis mellifera in Europe have recently been established in South Africa. Studies of the mite's introduction into South Africa suggest that African honeybee populations are less affected by the mite and can deal with and survive parasite loads which would kill colonies in the Northern Hemisphere. 5. This observed resilience in Africa and Americas is most likely based on the interactions between wild and managed bees, since a large proportion of the total honeybee population is wild in these regions and therefore not influenced by humans. This allows the wild population to adapt to new parasites/pathogens, without human interference, with the large numbers of wild colonies ensuring that resilience is high. A high ratio of wild to managed colonies could also ensure that beneficial adaptations in the wild population filter through to the managed population. 6. Whether a similar situation prevails in bumblebees with wild and managed populations needs to be more carefully examined, particularly in the context of the global trade in colonies of these bees. Our current understanding of the interaction between wild/feral and managed populations suggests that transporting of species out of their endemic range should be done with great caution.

Community-level studies provide an integrative assessment of invasion impacts and insights into factors that influence the vulnerability of different native species. We investigated effects of the nonnative herb Lythrum salicaria on pollination of native species in 14 fens of the eastern United States. We compared visitors per flower for 122 native plant species in invaded and uninvaded fens and incorporated a landscape-scale experiment, removing L. salicaria flowers from three of the invaded fens. Total flower densities were more than three times higher in invaded than uninvaded or removal sites when L. salicaria was blooming. Despite an increase in number of visitors with number of flowers per area, visitors per native flower declined with increasing numbers of flowers. Therefore, L. salicaria invasion depressed visitation to native flowers. In removal sites, visitation to native flowers was similar to uninvaded sites, confirming the observational results and also suggesting that invasion had not generated a persistent build-up of visitor populations. To study species-level impacts, we examined effects of invasion on visitors per flower for the 36 plant species flowering in both invaded and uninvaded fens. On average, the effect of invasion represented about a 20% reduction in visits per flower. We measured the influence of plant traits on vulnerability to L. salicaria invasion using meta-analysis. Bilaterally symmetrical flowers experienced stronger impacts on visitation, and similarity in flower color to L. salicaria weakly intensified competition with the invader for visitors. Finally, we assessed the reproductive consequences of competition with the invader in a dominant flowering shrub, Dasiphora fruticosa. Despite the negative effect of invasion on pollinator visitation in this species, pollen limitation of seed production was not stronger in invaded than in uninvaded sites, suggesting little impact of competition for pollinators on its population demography. Negative effects on pollination of native plants by this copiously flowering invader appeared to be mediated by increases in total flower density that were not matched by increases in pollinator density.

One species, Hylaeus azorae, seems to be a single island endemic, and three species are possibly native (Colletes eous, Halictus villosulus, and Hylaeus pictipes). All the remaining bee species are most likely accidental introductions that arrived after human colonization of the archipelago in the 15th century. Bee diversity in the Azores is similar to bee diversity of Madeira and Cape Verde but nearly ten times lower than it is in the Canary Islands.

Predicting acute contact toxicity of pesticides in honeybees (Apis mellifera) through a k-nearest neighbor model	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Pesticides; Honey bees; k-NN; In silico models; Acute contact toxicity	BEE; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Ecological risk assessment of plant protection products (PPPs) requires an understanding of both the toxicity and the extent of exposure to assess risks for a range of taxa of ecological importance including target and non-target species. Non-target species such as honey bees (Apis mellifera), solitary bees and bumble bees are of utmost importance because of their vital ecological services as pollinators of wild plants and crops. To improve risk assessment of PPPs in bee species, computational models predicting the acute and chronic toxicity of a range of PPPs and contaminants can play a major role in providing structural and physico-chemical properties for the prioritisation of compounds of concern and future risk assessments; Over the last three decades, scientific advisory bodies and the research community have developed toxicological databases and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that are proving invaluable to predict toxicity using historical data and reduce animal testing. This paper describes the development and validation of a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) model using in-house software for the prediction of acute contact toxicity of pesticides on honey bees. Acute contact toxicity data were collected from different sources for 256 pesticides, which were divided into training and test sets. The k-NN models were validated with good prediction, with an accuracy of 70% for all compounds and of 65% for highly toxic compounds, suggesting that they might reliably predict the toxicity of structurally diverse pesticides and could be used to screen and prioritise new pesticides.

Unbiased RNA Shotgun Metagenomics in Social and Solitary Wild Bees Detects Associations with Eukaryote Parasites and New Viruses	PLOS ONE			English	Article							KROMBEINI ACARI CHAETODACTYLIDAE; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; HYMENOPTERA; PATHOGEN; MICROSPORIDIA; POLLINATORS; PERFORMANCE; PASCUORUM	The diversity of eukaryote organisms and viruses associated with wild bees remains poorly characterized in contrast to the well-documented pathosphere of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera. Using a deliberate RNA shotgun metagenomic sequencing strategy in combination with a dedicated bioinformatics workflow, we identified the (micro-)organisms and viruses associated with two bumble bee hosts, Bombus terrestris and Bombus pascuorum, and two solitary bee hosts, Osmia corn uta and Andrena vaga. Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing generated approximately 3.8 million high quality reads. The most significant eukaryote associations were two protozoan, Apicystis bombiand Crithidia bombi, and one nematode parasite Sphaerularia bombi in bumble bees. The trypanosome protozoan C. bombi was also found in the solitary bee 0. corn uta. Next to the identification of three honey bee viruses Black queen cell virus, Sacbrood virus and Varroa destructor virus-1 and four plant viruses, we describe two novel RNA viruses Scaldis River bee virus (SRBV) and Ganda bee virus (GABV) based on their partial genomic sequences. The novel viruses belong to the class of negative-sense RNA viruses, SRBV is related to the order Mononegavirales whereas GABV is related to the family Bunyaviridae. The potential biological role of both viruses in bees is discussed in the context of recent advances in the field of arthropod viruses. Further, fragmentary sequence evidence for other undescribed viruses is presented, among which a nudivirus in 0. corn uta and an unclassified virus related to Chronic bee paralysis virus in B. terrestris. Our findings extend the current knowledge of wild bee parasites in general and addsto the growing evidence of unexplored arthropod viruses in valuable insects.

J	MacIvor, JS; Packer, L				MacIvor, J. Scott; Packer, Laurence			The Bees among Us: Modelling Occupancy of Solitary Bees	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; LAND-USE; DETECTION PROBABILITY; SPECIES OCCURRENCE; FORAGING RANGES; INTRODUCED BEES; WILD BEES; HYMENOPTERA; POLLINATION; CITY	Occupancy modelling has received increasing attention as a tool for differentiating between true absence and non-detection in biodiversity data. This is thought to be particularly useful when a species of interest is spread out over a large area and sampling is constrained. We used occupancy modelling to estimate the probability of three phylogenetically independent pairs of native-introduced species [Megachile campanulae (Robertson)-Megachile rotundata (Fab.), Megachile pugnata Say-Megachile centuncularis (L.), Osmia pumila Cresson-Osmia caerulescens (L.)] (Apoidea: Megachilidae) being present when repeated sampling did not always find them. Our study occurred along a gradient of urbanization and used nest boxes (bee hotels) set up over three consecutive years. Occupancy modelling discovered different patterns to those obtained by species detection and abundance-based data alone. For example, it predicted that the species that was ranked 4th in terms of detection actually had the greatest occupancy among all six species. The native M. pugnata had decreased occupancy with increasing building footprint and a similar but not significant pattern was found for the native O. pumila. Two introduced bees (M. rotundata and M. centuncularis), and one native (M. campanulae) had modelled occupancy values that increased with increasing urbanization. Occupancy probability differed among urban green space types for three of six bee species, with values for two native species (M. campanulae and O. pumila) being highest in home gardens and that for the exotic O. caerulescens being highest in community gardens. The combination of occupancy modelling with analysis of habitat variables as an augmentation to detection and abundance-based sampling is suggested to be the best way to ensure that urban habitat management results in the desired outcomes.

Native Bee Diversity and Pollen Foraging Specificity in Cultivated Highbush Blueberry (Ericaceae: Vaccinium corymbosum) in Rhode Island	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Andrenidae; Apidae; Colletidae; Halictidae; Megachilidae	LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY; FRUIT PRODUCTION; BUMBLE BEES; POLLINATION; HYMENOPTERA; APOIDEA; ABUNDANCE; WILD; REQUIREMENTS; BIOLOGY	We identified 41 species of native bees from a total of 1,083 specimens collected at cultivated highbush blueberry plantings throughout Rhode Island in 2014 and 2015. Andrena spp., Bombus spp., and Xylocopa virginica (L.) were collected most often. Bombus griseocollis (DeGeer), B. impatiens Cresson, B. bimaculatus Cresson, B. perplexus Cresson, and Andrena vicina Smith collected the largest mean numbers of blueberry pollen tetrads. The largest mean percent blueberry pollen loads were carried by the miner bees Andrena bradleyi Viereck (91%), A. carolina Viereck (90%), and Colletes validus Cresson (87%). The largest mean total pollen grain loads were carried by B. griseocollis (549,844), B. impatiens (389,558), X. virginica (233,500), and B. bimaculatus (193,132). Xylocopa virginica was the fourth and fifth most commonly collected bee species in 2014 and 2015, respectively. They exhibit nectar robbing and females carried relatively low blueberry pollen loads (mean 33%). Overall, we found 10 species of bees to be the primary pollinators of blueberries in Rhode Island.

J	Jimenez, DR; Cure, JR				Riano Jimenez, Diego; Ricardo Cure, Jose			Acute lethal effect of the commercial formulation of the insecticides Imidacloprid, Spinosad y Thiocyclam hidrogenoxalate in Bombus atratus (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL			Spanish	Article						bumblebees; lethal median dose; DL50; pollinators; toxicity	PESTICIDES; BUMBLEBEES; TOXICITY; IMPACT; BEES; POLLINATORS; DECLINES	The effect of insecticides on bees has gained great attention, however, there are few studies that explore this issue on Neotropical bees. Bombus atratus is a neotropical species broadly distributed in Colombia and is considered an important pollinator of both Andean ecosystems and agroecosystems. However, as for many wild bees species, the effect of insecticides on B. atratus is unknow. In this study we determined the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of commercial formulations of insecticides Imidacloprid, Spinosad and Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, widely used in Colombia to control several pests of important crops. The LD50 was carried out by oral and contact routes, following and modifying the EPPO and OECD guidelines to perform LD50 on A. mellifera. We evaluated five doses for each route and insecticide, in a total of 25 medium-size workers for each dose by duplicate. Mortality was registered at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the experiment; and data were analyzed with the Probit regression model. For Imidacloprid, contacts and oral LD50 were 0.048 mu g/bee and 0.010 mu g/bee, respectively. For Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, topical and oral LD50 were 0.244 mu g/bee and 0.056 mu g/bee, respectively. For Spinosad, the oral LD50 corresponded to 0.28 mu g/bee; it was not possible to establish the LD50 for the contact route. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Index of Relative Toxicity indicated that all three active ingredients are highly toxic.

It has been shown that domesticated honey bee larvae are raisable in a controlled environment. Here we demonstrate that this approach is also transferable to wild solitary bees and wasps without inducing negative effects on their development. Wells may also be supplemented with the antibiotic substance oxytetracycline to control the presence of bacteria. The method thus provides a useful tool to investigate offspring recruitment and larval development in solitary bees and wasps, plus their responses to manipulation of factors as for example diets, toxins and microbiota.

J	Cane, JH				Cane, James H.			Adult pollen diet essential for egg maturation by a solitary Osmia bee	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Helianthus; Foraging; Reproduction; Vitellogenesis; Apoidea; Yolk	APIS-MELLIFERA-CARNICA; HYMENOPTERA; CONSUMPTION; VITELLOGENESIS; MEGACHILIDAE; SYRPHIDAE; APOIDEA; NECTAR	Reproduction is a nutritionally costly activity for many insects, as their eggs are rich in lipids and proteins. That cost seems especially acute for non-social bees, which for their size, lay enormous eggs. All adult female bees visit flowers, most of them to collect pollen and nectar, or sometimes oils, to feed their progeny. For adult bees, the need for pollen feeding has only been detailed for the honey bee, Apis mellifera. To experimentally test for the reproductive value of adult pollen feeding by a non-social bee, Osmia californica (Hymenoptera: Apiformes: Megachilidae), young female bees plus males were released into large glasshouse cages provided with either a male-fertile sunflower cultivar or a pollen-less one. Females regularly visited and drank nectar from flowers of both cultivars. Abundant orange pollen was seen regularly in guts of females confined with the male-fertile sunflowers, indicative of active pollen ingestion. All females' terminal oocytes (next egg to be laid) were small at emergence. Oocytes of females confined with the pollen-less sunflowers remained small, despite frequent nectaring and exposure to other floral stimuli. In contrast, the basal oocytes of female O. californica with access to pollen had swelled to full size within ten days following emergence, enabling them to lay eggs in provided nest tubes. Adult females of this solitary bee required dietary pollen to reproduce; nitrogen stores acquired as larvae were inadequate. Early and regular pollen feeding in part paces the onset and maximum tempo of solitary bees' lifetime reproductive output.

J	Sanderson, MA				Sanderson, Matt A.			Forage and Grasslands as Pollinator Habitat in North Dakota	CROP FORAGE & TURFGRASS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Perennial grasslands typically support a diversity of vegetation and an abundance of pollinators. The northern Great Plains provide critical habitat for pollinators, both native and those managed for honey production. The objective of this research was to broadly assess the land use adjacent to apiaries across North Dakota. In 2014 and 2015, the land use around 320 apiaries in North Dakota was documented in roadside surveys and site visits. Results showed that apiaries were most often located near perennial grassland, followed by small grain crops, grazingland, and trees. The distribution of apiaries seemed to follow the acreage of crops in North Dakota. There was a greater frequency of apiaries associated with hay and pasture than other crops, except small grains, in relation to crop acreage. The number of crops or land uses surrounding the apiaries ranged from 1 to 5, with hay crops the most common followed by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and pasture. Apiaries were also frequently located in abandoned farmsteads and near shelterbelts. The results presented here highlight the value of forage and grazinglands in providing additional ecosystem services that support native pollinators and a large domestic honey bee industry.

J	Russo, L				Russo, Laura			Positive and Negative Impacts of Non-Native Bee Species around the World	INSECTS			English	Review						bees; competition; genetic introgression; impacts; invasive species; pollination; species introductions		Though they are relatively understudied, non-native bees are ubiquitous and have enormous potential economic and environmental impacts. These impacts may be positive or negative, and are often unquantified. In this manuscript, I review literature on the known distribution and environmental and economic impacts of 80 species of introduced bees. The potential negative impacts of non-native bees include competition with native bees for nesting sites or floral resources, pollination of invasive weeds, co-invasion with pathogens and parasites, genetic introgression, damage to buildings, affecting the pollination of native plant species, and changing the structure of native pollination networks. The potential positive impacts of non-native bees include agricultural pollination, availability for scientific research, rescue of native species, and resilience to human-mediated disturbance and climate change. Most non-native bee species are accidentally introduced and nest in stems, twigs, and cavities in wood. In terms of number of species, the best represented families are Megachilidae and Apidae, and the best represented genus is Megachile. The best studied genera are Apis and Bombus, and most of the species in these genera were deliberately introduced for agricultural pollination. Thus, we know little about the majority of non-native bees, accidentally introduced or spreading beyond their native ranges.

Experimental evidence that honeybees depress wild insect densities in a flowering crop	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						crop pollinators; flies; interspecific competition; oilseed rape; wild bees	APIS-MELLIFERA; POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; OILSEED RAPE; BEE; IMPACT; COMPETITION; BUMBLEBEES; EXPANSION; REDUCE; GROWTH	While addition of managed honeybees (Apis mellifera) improves pollination of many entomophilous crops, it is unknown if it simultaneously suppresses the densities of wild insects through competition. To investigate this, we added 624 honeybee hives to 23 fields of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) over 2 years and made sure that the areas around 21 other fields were free from honeybee hives. We demonstrate that honeybee addition depresses the densities of wild insects (bumblebees, solitary bees, hoverflies, marchflies, other flies, and other flying and flower-visiting insects) even in amassive flower resource such as oilseed rape. The effect was independent of the complexity of the surrounding landscape, but increased with the size of the crop field, which suggests that the effect was caused by spatial displacement of wild insects. Our results have potential implications both for the pollination of crops (if displacement of wild pollinators offsets benefits achieved by adding honeybees) and for conservation of wild insects (if displacement results in negative fitness consequences).

Honey Bee Viruses in Wild Bees: Viral Prevalence, Loads, and Experimental Inoculation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEFORMED-WING-VIRUS; ACUTE PARALYSIS VIRUS; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; POLLINATORS; INFECTION; PATHOGEN; BUMBLEBEES; DECLINE; TRENDS	Evidence of inter-species pathogen transmission from managed to wild bees has sparked concern that emerging diseases could be causing or exacerbating wild bee declines. While some pathogens, like RNA viruses, have been found in pollen and wild bees, the threat these viruses pose to wild bees is largely unknown. Here, we tested 169 bees, representing 4 families and 8 genera, for five common honey bee (Apis mellifera) viruses, finding that more than 80% of wild bees harbored at least one virus. We also quantified virus titers in these bees, providing, for the first time, an assessment of viral load in a broad spectrum of wild bees. Although virus detection was very common, virus levels in the wild bees were minimal D similar to or lower than foraging honey bees and substantially lower than honey bees collected from hives. Furthermore, when we experimentally inoculated adults of two different bee species (Megachile rotundata and Colletes inaequalis) with a mixture of common viruses that is lethal to honey bees, we saw no effect on short term survival. Overall, we found that honey bee RNA viruses can be commonly detected at low levels in many wild bee species, but we found no evidence that these pathogens cause elevated short-term mortality effects. However, more work on these viruses is greatly needed to assess effects on additional bee species and life stages.

J	Campbell, JW; Campbell, BE; Kimmel, CB; Galvan, P				Campbell, Joshua W.; Campbell, Brittany E.; Kimmel, Chase B.; Galvan, Paula			Observations of insect visitors to Price's Potato Bean (Apios priceana, Fabaceae) in North Alabama, USA	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Pollinators; Apios priceana; Megachile sculpturalis; Bombus; Alabama	MEGACHILE CALLOMEGACHILE SCULPTURALIS; AMERICANA LEGUMINOSAE; BIOLOGY; SMITH; BEE	Background and aims - Apios priceana is a rare flowering plant that can only be found in parts of the Southeastern United States. Little is known about the reproductive biology of this plant and only a few insect flower visitors have been previously documented. The aim of this study was to further document the insect flower visitors of A. priceana in North Alabama. Methods - Cameras and observers recorded flower visitors during the 2014 blooming season of a large North Alabama population of A. priceana. Key results - Although fifteen different species of insects were documented on flowers of A. priceana, most performed a single or very few visits. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.), two species of Megachilidae (Megachile sculpturalis and Megachile campanulae), and the hummingbird clearwing (Hemaris thysbe) were the most common visitors. Interestingly, the giant resin bee, M. sculpturalis, is considered to be an invasive species but in this case may be pollinating a native and Federally threatened plant. Conclusion - Although A. priceana flowers are visited by numerous insects, Bombus spp. and, surprisingly, an invasive species (Megachile sculpturalis) are probably the most important pollinators of this plant.

J	Schmuck, R; Lewis, G				Schmuck, Richard; Lewis, Gavin			Review of field and monitoring studies investigating the role of nitro-substituted neonicotinoid insecticides in the reported losses of honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera)	ECOTOXICOLOGY			English	Review						Neonicotinoids; Risk assessment; Bee monitoring; Honey bees; Bumble bees; Solitary bees	SEED-TREATED CANOLA; OILSEED RAPE; EXPOSURE; INCIDENTS; HEALTH; FALL	The nitro-substituted neonicotinoid insecticides, which include imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, are widely used to control a range of important agricultural pests both by foliar applications and also as seed dressings and by soil application. Since they exhibit systemic properties, exposure of bees may occur as a result of residues present in the nectar and/or pollen of seed- or soil-treated crop plants and so they have been the subject of much debate about whether they cause adverse effects in pollinating insects under field conditions. Due to these perceived concerns, the use of the three neonicotinoids imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam has been temporarily suspended in the European Union for seed treatment, soil application and foliar treatment in crops attractive to bees. Monitoring data from a number of countries are available to assess the presence of neonicotinoid residues in honey bee samples and possible impacts at the colony level and these are reviewed here together with a number of field studies which have looked at the impact of clothiandin on honey bees in relation to specific crop use and in particular with oilseed rape. Currently there is considerable uncertainty with regards to the regulatory testing requirements for field studies. Accordingly, a testing protocol was developed to address any acute and chronic risks from oilseed rape seeds containing a coating with 10 g clothianidin and 2 g beta-cyfluthrin per kg seeds (Elado(A (R))) for managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, commercially bred bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) colonies and red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) as a representative solitary bee species.

However, uncertainty remains, because only the median and rear zones of this cocoon type have thus far been analyzed. Here, we studied the front zone of this cocoon, searching its components and their organization, to fill this knowledge gap. Topochemical assays, polarization microscopy and Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy were used to study cross sections from L. chrysurus cocoon. Three main layers differing in structural organization were found to compose the cocoon wall. Silk fibroins were assumed to constitute the filamentous threads of the inner and outer layers and the laminar structure of the intermediate layer. Deduced from its topochemical properties and FT-IR spectral signature, a foamy material containing mucin glycoproteins and carboxylated acid glycosaminoglycans was found in the intermediate layer. FT-IR analysis using a Savitzky-Golay 2nd-derivative and absence of linear dichroism and birefringence phenomena suggest that a random-coil secondary structure predominates in the foam component. Co-existence of alpha-helical and beta-sheet conformations is also hypothesized for the fibroin component of this cocoon. It is thus concluded that in addition to fibroin elements, a mucous component, likely contributed by a Malpighian tubule secretion, integrates the composition of the front zone of the cocoon wall of L chrysurus. In addition, the FT-IR analysis of the inner layer silk of this cocoon suggests significant differences in comparison to the silk fibroins of the silkworm, and some minor spectral differences in comparison to published data on the honeybee silk, with respect to protein secondary structure.

Observations of Africanized honey bee Apis mellifera scutellata absence and presence within and outside forests across Rondonia, Brazil	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Amazon; Apidae; Deforestation; Invasive species; Land use	NATIVE BEES; STINGLESS BEES; DEFORESTATION; CONSERVATION; IMPACT; APIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; NEOTROPICS; MELIPONINI; INVASION	The Africanized honey bee (AHB) has generated much research on invasion ecology and impacts on native pollinators ever since its introduction in Brazil approximately 60 years ago. Some have sought to determine how deforestation plays a role in mediating impacts between the AHB and native pollinators. We present the largest-ever, systematic survey of AHB presence/absence in the Neotropics to test to what extent the AHB prefers to forage within forests vs. outside forests. AHB presence/absence within and outside forest fragments was recorded at 187 locations distributed across the state of Rondonia, Brazil. The landscapes at each location varied in terms of overall level of deforestation and the length of time since modern human settlement. AHB presence was significantly higher outside forest cover. These findings agree with previous studies documenting the spread of AHBs in the Amazon in their preference for deforested areas.	[Brown, J.

Molecular detection of the tracheal mite Locustacarus buchneri in native and non-native bumble bees in Chile	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Bombus dahlbomii; PCR detection; Specific primers; CO1 gene; Pollinators	WORLDWIDE MIGRATION; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; PARASITIC MITES; COMMERCIALIZATION; INFECTION; ACCURATE; RATIO	Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are considered one of the most important pollinators of native, non-native, and domesticated plants. Pathogens and parasites, such as the tracheal mite Locustacarus buchneri (Podapolipidae), are harmful to bumble bees. We developed primers based on the mitochondrial CO1 gene for the specific detection of L. buchneri directly from samples of native Bombus dahlbomii and non-native B. terrestris and B. ruderatus. PCR products amplified and sequenced for these primers shared 100 % identity among themselves and around 99-100 % identity with other sequences of L. buchneri reported in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Japan. Bombus terrestris was the most infected species (41 %), followed by B. ruderatus (31 %) and B. dahlbomii (23 %). This is the first report involving L. buchneri in native and non-native bumble bees in Chile.

Here, we evaluated the influence of landscape structure over bee community composition and coffee (Coffea arabica) pollination. Our study was undertaken in one of the most important coffee-producing regions of Brazil, and comprised nine landscapes of sun coffee plantations surrounded by different amounts of Atlantic Forest remnants. Using floral exclusion experiments we evaluated fruit set in 15 coffee shrubs per landscape. We also sampled the bees visiting coffee flowers. Our analyses were made at two landscape scales, with 1 and 2 km radii, and one shrub scale, with 300 m radius around each coffee shrub. We collected 241 bee individuals and identified a total of 22 species. The honeybee Apis mellifera (Apini) was the most abundant flower visitor followed by Trigona spinipes (Meliponini). Native bee abundance, richness and diversity were positively affected by forest cover at the shrub scale. Honeybee abundance, on the other hand, was negatively affected by forest cover at the shrub scale. The presence of bees resulted in an increase in coffee fruit set of 28%. A. mellifera abundance positively affected fruit set across spatial scales, while the composition of the native bee community affected fruit set differently at the landscape scales than at the shrub scale. Our work shows that bee pollination services are affected by landscape structure at different spatial scales. These findings can be used in conservation and agricultural planning to maximize crop production while safeguarding biodiversity and the provision of pollination services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Competition between managed honeybees and wild bumblebees depends on landscape context	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Interspecific competition; Apis mellifera; Bombus; Landscape complexity; Pollinators; Flower resources	BEES; POLLINATORS; APIDAE	Honeybees might outcompete wild bees by depleting common resources, possibly more so in simplified landscapes where flower-rich habitats have been lost. We tested this by experimentally adding honeybee hives to nine sites while ensuring that ten additional sites were free from hives. The landscape surrounding each geographically separated site either held low (homogeneous landscape) or high (heterogeneous landscape) proportions of semi-natural grassland. Adding honeybees suppressed bumblebee densities in field borders and road verges in homogeneous landscapes whereas no such effect was detected in heterogeneous landscapes. The proportional abundance of bumblebee species with small foraging ranges was lower at honeybee sites than at control sites in heterogeneous landscapes, whereas bumblebee communities in homogeneous landscapes were dominated by a single species with long foraging range irrespective of if honeybees were added or not. We conclude that honeybees can impact bumblebee densities, but that landscape heterogeneity modified this effect.

Beekeeping practices and geographic distance, not land use, drive gene flow across tropical bees	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						beekeeping; dispersal; land use; landscape genetics; pollination; stingless bees	ATLANTIC RAIN-FOREST; STINGLESS BEE; TETRAGONISCA-ANGUSTULA; POLLINATOR DECLINE; WILD POLLINATORS; MODEL SELECTION; APIDAE; POPULATIONS; LANDSCAPE; CONSERVATION	Across the globe, wild bees are threatened by ongoing natural habitat loss, risking the maintenance of plant biodiversity and agricultural production. Despite the ecological and economic importance of wild bees and the fact that several species are now managed for pollination services worldwide, little is known about how land use and beekeeping practices jointly influence gene flow. Using stingless bees as a model system, containing wild and managed species that are presumed to be particularly susceptible to habitat degradation, here we examine the main drivers of tropical bee gene flow. We employ a novel landscape genetic approach to analyse data from 135 populations of 17 stingless bee species distributed across diverse tropical biomes within the Americas. Our work has important methodological implications, as we illustrate how a maximum-likelihood approach can be applied in a meta-analysis framework to account for multiple factors, and weight estimates by sample size. In contrast to previously held beliefs, gene flow was not related to body size or deforestation, and isolation by geographic distance (IBD) was significantly affected by management, with managed species exhibiting a weaker IBD than wild ones. Our study thus reveals the critical importance of beekeeping practices in shaping the patterns of genetic differentiation across bee species. Additionally, our results show that many stingless bee species maintain high gene flow across heterogeneous landscapes. We suggest that future efforts to preserve wild tropical bees should focus on regulating beekeeping practices to maintain natural gene flow and enhancing pollinator-friendly habitats, prioritizing species showing a limited dispersal ability.

J	Hill, B; Bartomeus, I				Hill, Bruce; Bartomeus, Ignasi			The potential of electricity transmission corridors in forested areas as bumblebee habitat	Royal Society Open Science			English	Article						Bombus; ecosystem service; conservation; pollination; maintained electricity transmission corridor; Sweden	ARABLE FIELD MARGINS; POLLINATION SERVICES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; CROP POLLINATION; BEE ABUNDANCE; LINE CORRIDOR; LANDSCAPE; DECLINE; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT	Declines in pollinator abundance and diversity are not only a conservation issue, but also a threat to crop pollination. Maintained infrastructure corridors, such as those containing electricity transmission lines, are potentially important wild pollinator habitat. However, there is a lack of evidence comparing the abundance and diversity of wild pollinators in transmission corridors with other important pollinator habitats. We compared the diversity of a key pollinator group, bumblebees (Bombus spp.), between transmission corridors and the surrounding semi- natural and managed habitat types at 10 sites across Sweden's Uppland region. Our results show that transmission corridors have no impact on bumblebee diversity in the surrounding area. However, transmission corridors and other maintained habitats such as roadsides have a level of bumblebee abundance and diversity comparable to semi- natural grasslands and host species that are important for conservation and ecosystem service provision. Under the current management regime, transmission corridors already provide valuable bumblebee habitat, but given that host plant density is the main determinant of bumblebee abundance, these areas could potentially be enhanced by establishing and maintaining key host plants. We show that in northern temperate regions the maintenance of transmission corridors has the potential to contribute to bumblebee conservation and the ecosystem services they provide.

The toolbox is based on characteristics of a healthy managed honeybee colony: an adequate size, demographic structure and behaviour; an adequate production of bee products (both in relation to the annual life cycle of the colony and the geographical location); and provision of pollination services. The attributes 'queen presence and performance', 'demography of the colony', 'in-hive products' and 'disease, infection and infestation' could be directly measured in field conditions across the EU, whereas 'behaviour and physiology' is mainly assessed through experimental studies. Analysing the resource providing unit, in particular land cover/use, of a honeybee colony is very important when assessing its health status, but tools are currently lacking that could be used at apiary level in field surveys across the EU. Data on 'beekeeping management practices' and 'environmental drivers' can be collected via questionnaires and available databases, respectively. The capacity to provide pollination services is regarded as an indication of a healthy colony, but it is assessed only in relation to the provision of honey because technical limitations hamper the assessment of pollination as regulating service (e.g. to pollinate wild plants) in field surveys across the EU. Integrating multiple attributes of honeybee health, for instance, via a Health Status Index, is required to support a holistic assessment. Examples are provided on how the toolbox could be used by different stakeholders. Continued interaction between the Member State organisations, the EU Reference Laboratory and EFSA is required to further validate methods and facilitate the efficient use of precise and accurate bee health data that are collected by many initiatives throughout the EU.

Defining the Insect Pollinator Community Found in Iowa Corn and Soybean Fields: Implications for Pollinator Conservation	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						ecosystem service; community analysis; prairie	PRAIRIE FILTER STRIPS; GLYCINE-MAX L.; AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS; BUFFER STRIPS; GENE FLOW; CROPS; WILD; BEES; MANAGEMENT; LANDSCAPES	Although corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max L.) do not require pollination, they offer floral resources used by insect pollinators. We asked if a similar community of insect pollinators visits these crops in central Iowa, a landscape dominated by corn and soybean production. We used modified pan traps (i.e., bee bowls) in both corn and soybean fields during anthesis and used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) to compare the communities found in the two crops. Summed across both crops, 6,704 individual insects were captured representing at least 60 species, morphospecies, or higher-level taxa. Thirty-four species were collected in both crops, 19 collected only in corn and seven were collected only in soybean. The most abundant taxa were Lasioglossum [Dialictus] spp., Agapostemon virescens Cresson, Melissodes bimaculata (Lepeletier), and Toxomerus marginatus (Say), which accounted for 65% of the insect pollinators collected from both crops. Although social bees (Apis mellifera L. and Bombus spp.) were found in both crops, they accounted for only 0.5% of all insects captured. The NMS analysis revealed a shared community of pollinators composed of mostly solitary, ground nesting bees. Many of these species have been found in other crop fields throughout North America. Although corn and soybean are grown in landscapes that are often highly disturbed, these data suggest that a community of pollinators can persist within them. We suggest approaches to conserving this community based on partnering with activities that aim to lessen the environmental impact of annual crop production.	[Wheelock, M. J.; Rey, K. P.; O'Neal, M.

J	Cane, JH; Love, B				Cane, James H.; Love, Byron			Floral Guilds of Bees in Sagebrush Steppe: Comparing Bee Usage of Wildflowers Available for Postfire Restoration	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						Apoidea; Asteraceae; Great Basin; oligolecty; restoration	ASTRAGALUS; ATTRACTIVENESS; HYMENOPTERA; PATTERNS; BIOLOGY	Healthy plant communities of the American sagebrush steppe consist of mostly wind-pollinated shrubs and grasses interspersed with a diverse mix of mostly spring-blooming, herbaceous perennial wildflowers. Native, nonsocial bees are their common floral visitors, but their floral associations and abundances are poorly known. Extrapolating from the few available pollination studies, bees are the primary pollinators needed for seed production. Bees, therefore, will underpin the success of ambitious seeding efforts to restore native forbs to impoverished sagebrush steppe communities following vast wildfires. This study quantitatively characterized the floral guilds of 17 prevalent wildflower species of the Great Basin that are, or could be, available for restoration seed mixes. More than 3800 bees representing >170 species were sampled from >35,000 plants. Species of Osmia, Andrena, Bombus, Eucera, Halictus, and Lasioglossum bees prevailed. The most thoroughly collected floral guilds, at Balsamorhiza sagittata and Astragalus filipes, comprised 76 and 85 native bee species, respectively. Pollen-specialists dominated guilds at Lomatium dissectum, Penstemon speciosus, and several congenerics. In contrast, the two native wildflowers used most often in sagebrush steppe seeding mixes-Achillea millefolium and Linum lewisii-attracted the fewest bees, most of them unimportant in the other floral guilds. Successfully seeding more of the other wildflowers studied here would greatly improve degraded sagebrush steppe for its diverse native bee communities.

Therefore, in co-flowering plant communities, the proportion of visits to a focal plant species in individual pollinator foraging bouts determines reproductive outcomes for that species. We investigated the factors determining bee visits to the plant Astragalus scaphoides within foraging bouts in a natural multispecies community in the northern Rocky Mountains. We found that both conspecific and heterospecific floral density influenced the proportion of visits to A. scaphoides during foraging bouts, but these effects of floral density differed among two abundant bee groups. Our field observations reject the null expectation that bees visit plant species in direct proportion to their relative floral densities. Bombus consistently visited A. scaphoides more than expected, while solitary bees of the genera Anthophora and Eucera exhibited a nonlinear response to floral density.

In Ontario, Canada, pollinator-relevant policy and management plans are currently being developed by various ministries with diverse mandates. This review gathers relevant scientific findings to help guide policy decisions and implementation, focusing on the available information for wild bumble bees. Species that occur in Ontario also occur elsewhere in Canada and the United States. Thus, relevant studies from other jurisdictions are also included if they consider species that occur in Ontario. Evidence for declines, review of known and suspected threats, and management recommendations based on this information are presented.

J	Mawdsley, JR; Humpert, M				Mawdsley, Jonathan R.; Humpert, Mark			Revised State Wildlife Action Plans Offer New Opportunities for Pollinator Conservation in the USA	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						bumble bee; butterfly; conservation; pollinator; State Wildlife Action Plans		The 56 US State Wildlife Action Plans provide strategic guidance and direction for the state, territorial, and federal wildlife and natural resource management agencies in the United States. Funding associated with these plans supports a broad spectrum of state wildlife diversity and nongame programs, state natural heritage programs, and state natural areas programs. The implementation of these plans is being coordinated by the state and territorial fish and wildlife agencies, which have legal management authority for much of the native pollinator diversity in the United States. Forty of the 56 plans published in 2005 included taxa from one or more pollinator groups, including representatives of the insect orders Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera (Insecta), as well as nectar-feeding bats and hummingbirds. We document specific examples of pollinator conservation projects that have been conducted by state fish and wildlife agencies between 2005 and 2015 in order to achieve conservation objectives identified in the State Wildlife Action Plans. Comprehensive revisions of these plans, completed in 2015 and now under review by the US Fish and Wildlife Service for final approval, will include significant increases in coverage of pollinator taxa. Based on our surveys of state wildlife planners in May and June 2015, we document increases in the number of states that are including moths, nectar-feeding bats, bumble bees, and other native bees in their revised plans. The increased coverage of pollinator taxa in these plans will generate additional opportunities for pollinator conservation for the state agencies and their partners	[Mawdsley, Jonathan R.; Humpert, Mark] Assoc Fish & Wildlife Agencies, 1100 First St NE,Suite 825, Washington, DC 20002 USA	Mawdsley, JR (corresponding author), Assoc Fish & Wildlife Agencies, 1100 First St NE,Suite 825, Washington, DC 20002 USA.	jmawdsley@fish-wildlife.org					Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, 2011, STAT TRIB WILDL GRAN; Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies Teaming With Wildlife Committee State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) Best Practices Working Group, 2012, BEST PRACT STAT WILD; Benson A., 2016, NATL LOOK SPECIES GR; Bried JT, 2010, INSECT CONSERV DIVER, V3, P61, DOI 10.1111/j.1752-4598.2010.00081.x; Cook M.T., 2008, STATE WILDLIFE ACTIO; Fontaine JJ, 2011, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V92, P1403, DOI 10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.10.015; Mawdsley J.R., T 80 N AM WILDL NAT; Meretsky VJ, 2012, BIOSCIENCE, V62, P970, DOI 10.1525/bio.2012.62.11.6; National Research Council, 2007, STAT POLL N AM; NatureServe, 2012, NATURESERVE CONS STA; Pollock C.M., 2008, IUCN RED LIST THREAT; Riexinger P., 2009, T 74 N AM WILDL NAT, P82; Stoms D., 2010, GAP ANAL B, V17, P30; The Heinz Center, 2013, POLL STAT WILDL ACT	14	2	2	0	16	NATURAL AREAS ASSOC	ROCKFORD	320 SOUTH THIRD ST, ROCKFORD, IL 61104 USA	0885-8608	2162-4399		NAT AREA J	Nat.

Seed predators can increase nectar volumes in an alpine daisy: but do the insects benefit?

We examined how pre-dispersal seed predators modify nectar quality and quantity and thereby influence pollinator behaviour. Working in a Tibetan alpine meadow, we hypothesized that increasing levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by larvae of tephritid flies would reduce nectar quantity and quality in Saussurea nigrescens (Asteraceae), and that this would make the flowers less attractive to honeybees, the most frequent floral visitors. Our field experiments showed that floret nectar volumes responded differently to high and low densities of fly larvae, with significant increases when there was one larva present, but decreases when two or more larvae were present in a capitulum. Experimental manipulations of fly larvae yielded the same result. The increases in nectar volume generated by a single larva are likely to be beneficial for these insects in locations where pollinators preferentially visit those S. nigrescens that produce more nectar. At our study sites, honeybees were the main pollinators and visitation rates were unaffected by the changes in nectar volumes, but they are introduced to the area, and native pollinators may be more selective.

JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Vision; Behaviour; Colour; Interommatidial angle; Insect	COLOR-VISION; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; MELIPONA-QUADRIFASCIATA; SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY; BEHAVIORAL EVIDENCE; SMITH HYMENOPTERA; VISUAL-ACUITY; POLLINATION; APIDAE	We tested the endemic Australian Tetragonula carbonaria bee as a model of how colour vision may allow these small bees to find flowers. In a Y-Maze apparatus, we presented stimuli that contained both chromatic- and green-receptor contrasts, or only had chromatic contrast to free flying bees. Stimuli were detected at visual angles of 9.5A degrees and 9.3A degrees, respectively. We next made morphological measurements of the compound eye under high magnification using a digital microscope, and despite a relatively small eye size with a surface area of 0.64 +/- A 0.02 mm(2), the compound eye contained 3010 +/- A 10 ommatidia. Measurements of diverging rays of light using antidromic illumination revealed a mean interommatidial angle in the frontal visual field measures 1.56A degrees A A +/- A 0.10A degrees. Finally, we calculate that the minimum number of ommatidia that need to be excited for object detection is 33, which is much higher than for object detection in bumblebees and for the detection of objects providing both colour and green contrasts by honeybees, but lower for the detection of an object lacking green contrast in honeybees. We discuss reasons that may explain potential tradeoff for foraging bees.

Comparing diversity to flower-bee interaction networks reveals unsuccessful foraging of native bees in disturbed habitats	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Bipartite network; Community diversity; Ecological trap; Floral diversity; Land management; Plant-pollinator interactions	PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; LAND-USE; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; SOLITARY BEES; ECOLOGY; FIRE; FRAGMENTATION; CONSEQUENCES; CONSERVATION; METAANALYSIS	As land is converted to agriculture (e.g., pastures), natural vegetation is repeatedly disturbed, creating various levels of habitat alteration in which flowering plants and pollinators (e.g., bees) interact. Community structure of flowering plants, bees, and flower-bee interactions may each respond to disturbance, but potentially in different ways or magnitudes. We studied flowering plants, bees, and their interactions across four mechanical disturbance levels in and near Archbold Biological Station, Florida (USA) for one year, using repeated sampling with standard techniques in replicated plots. Data were analyzed for community structure, flower-bee interactions and bipartite network structure. Over 7500 flowering plants (81 species) and almost 5000 bees (48 species) were sampled, representing >80% of estimated species richness. Disturbance altered available flower diversity and both shifted and simplified compositions of floral and bee communities. Importantly, the number of foraging bee species did not decrease with disturbance but fewer bee species interacted with flowers given greater disturbance, indicating that disturbance reduced successful foraging. Interaction networks became simpler with disturbance, and the non-native European honey bee (Apis mellifera) became more dominant as disturbance intensity increased. Flower-bee interactions were most sensitive to disturbance. For some native bees, anthropogenic disturbance may contribute to ecological trap conditions and drive long-term diversity patterns. Attention to interaction networks will help land managers identify plant species to conserve and restore flowering plants that are vital to native pollinator communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Across six European regions and 2 years, we assessed how landscape-scale cover of MFCs affected pollinator densities in 408 MFC fields and adjacent SNHs. In MFC fields, densities of bumblebees, solitary bees, managed honeybees and hoverflies were negatively related to the cover of MFCs in the landscape. In SNHs, densities of bumblebees declined with increasing cover of MFCs but densities of honeybees increased. The densities of all pollinators were generally unrelated to the cover of SNHs in the landscape. Although MFC fields apparently attracted pollinators from SNHs, in landscapes with large areas of MFCs they became diluted. The resulting lower densities might negatively affect yields of pollinator- dependent crops and the reproductive success of wild plants. An expansion of MFCs needs to be accompanied by pollinator-supporting practices in agricultural landscapes.

Local bumble bee decline linked to recovery of honey bees, drought effects on floral resources	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Apis mellifera; Bombus; bumble bee; climate; competition; drought; floral resources; honey bee; pollinator declines; population trends	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CALIFORNIA DROUGHT; CRESTED BUTTE; NATIVE BEES; BOMBUS; POLLINATION; HYMENOPTERA	Time series of abundances are critical for understanding how abiotic factors and species interactions affect population dynamics, but are rarely linked with experiments and also scarce for bee pollinators. This gap is important given concerns about declines in some bee species. I monitored honey bee (Apis mellifera) and bumble bee (Bombus spp.) foragers in coastal California from 1999, when feral A. mellifera populations were low due to Varroa destructor, until 2014. Apis mellifera increased substantially, except between 2006 and 2011, coinciding with declines in managed populations. Increases in A. mellifera strongly correlated with declines in Bombus and reduced diet overlap between them, suggesting resource competition consistent with past experimental results. Lower Bombus numbers also correlated with diminished floral resources. Declines in floral abundances were associated with drought and reduced spring rainfall. These results illustrate how competition with an introduced species may interact with climate to drive local decline of native pollinators.

Honeybees and bumblebees have strong preferences for 'blue' stimuli, and flowers of this colour typically present higher nectar rewards. Interestingly, flowers from multiple different locations around the world independently have the same distribution in bee colour space. Currently, however, there is a paucity of data on the innate colour preferences of stingless bees that are often implicated as being key pollinators in many parts of the world. In Australia, the endemic stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria is widely distributed and known to be an efficient pollinator of both native plants and agricultural crops. In controlled laboratory conditions, we tested the innate colour responses of na < ve bees using standard broadband reflectance stimuli representative of common flower colours. Colorimetric analyses considering hymenopteran vision and a hexagon colour space revealed a difference between test colonies, and a significant effect of green contrast and an interaction effect of green contrast with spectral purity on bee choices. We also observed colour preferences for stimuli from the blue and blue-green categorical regions of colour space. Our results are discussed in relation to the similar distribution of flower colours observed from bee pollination around the world.

However, the role of A. mellifera as an introduced species in natural areas is potentially more complicated. The impact of A. mellifera on native insect pollinators can depend on broad community context, as can the relative effectiveness of A. mellifera in pollination of both native and nonnative plant species outside of agricultural systems. Apis mellifera is highly generalist and able to interact with hundreds of native plant species following its naturalization. It is unlikely to wholly replace native pollinators as visitors of specialized plant species, and its behavioral characteristics tend to reduce A. mellifera's per-visit efficiency, even when its overall effectiveness is high. Preliminary results of our case study exploring the importance of A. mellifera vs. native bees as pollinators of native plants in Hawai'i indicate that A. mellifera is less important than native Hylaeus bees as a flower visitor of focal native plant species. In light of current global declines in A. mellifera populations, maintenance of a diversity of pollinators and pollinator habitat are critical conservation needs in natural areas.

Plant-pollinator observations made in March 2008 and 2009 were used to describe the pollination network for Ka'ena Point, one of Hawai'i's best-conserved coastal communities. The network includes 15 native plant species, two native bee species, and 26 nonnative insect taxa, forming 119 interactions. Network connectance is 29.4% and weighted nestedness is 17.9, which are similar to values of other dry-habitat, island networks. The network's structure has a core of generalized pollinators plus several more-specialized pollinators. Nearly all plant species interact with two or more generalist pollinators and a variable number of specialists. Small, nonnative bees (Lasioglossum, Ceratina), wasps (Proconura), and flies (mostly Tachinidae) were responsible for 72.7% of flower visits, and they visit five plant species not visited by native bees. The two native visitors were the bees Hylaeus anthracinus and H. longiceps (both proposed as endangered). Hylaeus spp. (especially females) provided 19.8% of flower visits, foraging at high visitation rates and on many species, including the endangered Scaevola coriacea and Sesbania tomentosa. In Hawai'i's coastal habitat, nonnative insects form novel interactions with native species and may maintain an ecosystem's function following loss of most of the original native pollinators. However, their high visitation rates suggest that the two remaining native Hylaeus species are potentially important pollinators for many of the native plants on which they rely for nectar and pollen resources.

Interspecific sensitivity of bees towards dimethoate and implications for environmental risk assessment	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HONEY-BEES; HYMENOPTERA; DISTRIBUTIONS; INSECTICIDES; CANOLA; GENES	Wild and domesticated bee species are exposed to a variety of pesticides which may drive pollinator decline. Due to wild bee sensitivity data shortage, it is unclear if the honey bee Apis mellifera is a suitable surrogate species in the current EU risk assessment scheme. Furthermore, the underlying causes for sensitivity differences in bees are not established. We assessed the acute toxicity (median lethal dose, LD50) of dimethoate towards multiple bee species, generated a species sensitivity distribution and derived a hazardous dose (HD5). Furthermore, we performed a regression analysis with body weight and dimethoate toxicity. HD5 lower 95% confidence limit was equal to honey bee mean LD50 when applying a safety factor of 10. Body weight proved to be a predictor of interspecific bee sensitivity but did not explain the pattern completely. Using acute toxicity values from honey bees and a safety factor of 10 seems to cover the interspecific sensitivity range of bees in the case of dimethoate. Acute endpoints of proposed additional test species, the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris and the red mason bee Osmia bicornis, do not improve the risk assessment for the entire group. However, this might not apply to other insecticides such as neonicotinoids.

J	Niu, JZ; Meeus, I; Smagghe, G				Niu, Jinzhi; Meeus, Ivan; Smagghe, Guy			Differential expression pattern of Vago in bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), induced by virulent and avirulent virus infections	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							JAK-STAT PATHWAY; DROSOPHILA; MECHANISMS; INDUCTION; IMMUNITY	Viruses are one of the main drivers of the decline of domesticated and wild bees but the mechanisms of antiviral immunity in pollinators are poorly understood. Recent work has suggested that next to the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway other immune-related pathways play a role in the defense of the bee hosts against viral infection. In addition, Vago plays a role in the cross-talk between the innate immune pathways in Culex mosquito cells. Here we describe the Vago orthologue in bumblebees of Bombus terrestris, and investigated its role upon the infection of two different bee viruses, the virulent Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and the avirulent slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV). Our results showed that BtVago was downregulated upon the infection of IAPV that killed all bumblebees, but not with SBPV where the workers survived the virus infection. Thus, for the first time, Vago/Vago-like expression appears to be associated with the virulence of virus and may act as a modulator of antiviral immunity.

Bee diversity and abundance in a livestock drove road and its impact on pollination and seed set in adjacent sunflower fields	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ecosystem services; Pollinators; Sunflower; Livestock transhumance; Wild bees	LAND-USE INTENSITY; CROP POLLINATION; NATIVE BEES; WILD BEES; HONEYBEE POLLINATION; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FORAGING RANGES; FRUIT-SET; BIODIVERSITY	Natural and semi-natural habitats within agricultural landscapes provide food and nesting resources for wild bees, thus promoting crop pollination services. In central Spain, a large network of drove roads (DRs) crosses extensive areas of intensive agricultural fields. DRs are tracks (20-75 m wide) with semi-natural vegetation, protected for their priority function of transhumant livestock herding. In this study, we analyse the bee community of one of the main, Spanish DRs, and evaluate its effects on flower visitation and seed set in adjacent sunflower fields. We used pan traps to assess bee abundance and richness at 13 sites along the DR and in adjacent sunflower fields at 10, 75 and 150m from the DR. We also conducted visual counts to assess visitation rates to sunflower heads and measured seed set. Wild bee abundance and richness were significantly higher in the DR than in sunflower fields; but there were no significant differences among distances within sunflower fields. Honey bee abundance did not differ between the DR and sunflower fields. Wild bee visitation to sunflower heads was higher at 10 m compared to 75 and 150 m from the DR, but differences in honey bee visitation were non-significant. Sunflower seed set was significantly higher at 10 m compared to 75 and 150 m, and was associated with wild bee abundance, but not with honey bee abundance. Our results show that livestock DRs act as reservoirs of wild bee diversity within intensive agricultural matrices, enhancing wild bee visitation and seed set in adjacent sunflower crops.

The worldwide decline of bee populations, including wild pollinators, poses a threat to this system. However, most studies to date are situated in temperate regions where Apini and Bombini are very abundant pollinators. Tropical and subtropical regions where stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are generally very common, are often overlooked. These bees also face pressure due to deforestation and agricultural intensification as well as the growing use and spread of exotic pollinators as Apis mellifera and Bombus species. The loss or decline of this important bee tribe would have a large impact on their provided ecosystem services, in both wild and agricultural landscapes. The importance of pollinator diseases, which can contribute to decline, has not been investigated so far in this bee tribe. Here we report on the first large pathogen screening of Meliponini species in southern Brazil. Remarkably we observed that there was an absence of Leishmaniinae and Nosematidae, and a very low occurrence of Apicystis bombi. Our data on disease prevalence in both understudied areas and species, can greatly improve our knowledge on the distribution of pathogens among bee species.

(Myrtaceae) in fragments of Atlantic Forest in South Brazil	SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Species richness; Halictinae; Anthrenoides paolae; Apis mellifera; Scaptotrigona bipunctata	REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; POLLINATOR DECLINES; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; CONSERVATION; HONEYBEES; IMPACTS	Eugenia uniflora L. (Myrtaceae) is pollinated mostly by bees and there are no restrictions for pollen collection in their flowers. This stimulated us to study the bee diversity on its flowers in two forest fragments in southern Brazil, in August and September, 2012. A total of 826 bees belonging to 39 species and four subfamilies were captured with entomological nets. Halictinae presented the greatest richness, followed by Apinae, Colletinae and Andreninae. Apis mellifera was the only common species and the most abundant, followed by Scaptotrigona bipunctata and Melipona obscurior. Seven species were classified as intermediate and 31 as rare. Highest numbers of bees were collected from 10 to 11:30 h. The species richness of flower visiting bees was much higher than that of previous studies with first records of Plebeia remota and Anthrenoides paolae. Eugenia uniflora is a food source for exotic and native bees and possibly contributes to the conservation of these bees in forest fragments. In return, the bees probably act in maintaining this plant native of the Atlantic Forest.	[Diniz, M. E. R.; Buschini, M. L.

Flowering phenology influences bee community dynamics in old fields dominated by the invasive plant Centaurea stoebe	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Invasive species; Plant community diversity; Floral visitation; Native bees; Spotted knapweed	ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; POLLEN; POLLINATION; DIVERSITY; IMPACTS; DIFFUSA; BIOLOGY	Wild and managed bees provide critical pollination services to both native and cultivated plants, and the invasion of exotic plants can have positive or negative effects on bee communities. In this study we investigated the influence of the exotic invasive Centaurea stoebe ssp. micranthos (spotted knapweed) On bee species diversity and abundance in old-fields (Michigan, USA). We conducted field observations in knapweed dominated fields and adjacent fields with greater forb diversity to determine whether the bee communities foraging in each field type differed in their composition, diversity, and abundance, and to determine how bees' use of floral resources changed throughout the growing season. This was coupled with a common garden experiment that contrasted the attractiveness of C. stoebe to 12 native plant species, which occur in similar habitats, Both studies were conducted throughout the 2012-2013 growing seasons to examine the temporal effect of floral resource availability. C stoebe was the most heavily-visited plant, in terms of total bee visitation and bee species richness in both studies. While C. stoebe-dominated old-fields had high floral resource levels during its peak bloom period, before and after this period these fields contained very few floral resources. In contrast, diverse fields had a number of flowering plant species that provided floral resources before, during, and after C. stoebe bloom. As a result, diverse fields contained significantly greater season-long floral resource availability and significantly greater season-total bee abundance, diversity and species richness. This greater species richness was driven at least in part by the ability of diverse flowering plant communities to support bee species that are active before and after the bloom period of C. stoebe. Our results suggest that efforts in manage C. stoebe should take into account the floral resources the plant is providing, and coincide with the restoration of diverse forb communities in order to enhance bee foraging-habitat in old-fields.

Effects of spatial buffers from 0.5 to 8 km around each blueberry field on the abundance of the main wild pollinator, Bombus terrestris queens, were tested. Wild B. terrestris abundances were positively affected by natural forest area and negatively affected by high-food resource area, and these effects were strongest at a buffer radius of 1 and 3.5 km, respectively. Possibly, continuous food resources provided by natural forest areas favor colony establishment and growth, and/or increase overwintering survival of bumblebee queens. Also, pollinator dependent crop area can generate a "transient dilution effect" by decreasing the density of bumblebees in simultaneously flowering crops. Management strategies might increase crop pollination services by considering the importance of nesting and overwintering habitat quality/amount and area of simultaneously flowering crops requiring insect pollination.

Spill-over of pest control and pollination services into arable crops	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agri-environment schemes; Ecosystem services; Biocontrol; Pollination; Predator hunting guilds; Spill-over	BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; AGRICULTURE; DISTANCES; STRENGTH; HONEYBEE; INSECTS; IMPACTS	In order to make agriculture more sustainable it is important to enhance the natural processes supporting crop production, including pollination and pest control. The distance over which these services are delivered into the crop (referred to as spill-over) sets limitations on biodiversity mediated agriculture sustainability. We assess how pest control of aphids on wheat (Rhopalosiphum padi) and pollinator linked yield gain in oilseed rape decline with distance from the crop edge. For natural pest control we also assess how field margin floristic diversity (simple grass vs. species-rich wildflower) affects pest control. We do not consider the impact of field margins on oilseed rape pollination as perennial dominated field margins are not in flower at the time of oilseed rape seed set and so do not act to attract pollinators. Aphid colonies exposed to invertebrate natural enemies went extinct at a faster rate than colonies where they were excluded. The rate of decline in per capita growth rates of aphid colonies was greatest when exposed to natural predators, with this effect being detected up to 50 m into the crop where species-rich field margins were present. While oilseed rape yield gains were correlated with pollinator (bees and flies) visitation rates, there was no evidence that yield gain declined with distance from the crop edge. Possibly this was due to honeybees showing no evidence of declining visitation rates with distance into the crop (over 200 m). This contrast with bumblebees, solitary bees and flies which showed evidence of declining visitation rates with distance from the crop edge. Our results suggests that for a typical arable field (c. 12 ha) surrounded by species rich field margins, 50% of the total area could benefit from enhanced pest control services. Increased yields of oilseed rape due to insect pollinators of c. 0.4 t ha(-1) were identified, but there was no evidence that field size would limit the spatial distribution of yields. Our results have implications for integrated crop management world-wide through the use of variable dose rate applications technologies that could be used to target pesticides to field centres and so help support biodiversity mediated ecosystem services.

Uncultivated field boundaries constitute a significant part of the remaining semi-natural habitat in simplified agricultural landscapes, providing habitats for many grassland species. In Europe, agri-environment schemes (AES) offer incentives to farmers to manage farmland more environmentally friendly. In Sweden, one AES has specifically targeted management of incidental habitats on farmland by promoting removal of woody vegetation to benefit cultural heritage and biodiversity. 2. This study investigates if pollinating insects benefit from removal of woody vegetation and whether any such benefits depend on the structural complexity of the surrounding landscape. Using a nested study design, pollinator communities were compared in pairs of managed and unmanaged field boundaries in landscapes of different complexity. 3. The effect of removing trees and bushes in field boundaries varied among pollinator groups. Bumblebee species richness and abundance benefited from the management, whereas the species richness of solitary bees and hoverflies were unaffected. The abundance of solitary bees was higher in managed field boundaries, but only late in the season in complex landscapes, while the same management lowered the hoverfly abundance particularly late in the season. Landscape complexity did not affect bumblebees, while the abundance of solitary bees and the species richness of hoverflies were positively correlated with increasing landscape complexity, but at different spatial scales. 4. The contrasting effects of management on different organism groups shown in this study, illustrate the importance of studies conducted on multiple taxa. Management prescriptions based on results from one pollinator group may not benefit other pollinator groups.	[Soderman, Annika M.

J	Goulson, D; Nicholls, E				Goulson, Dave; Nicholls, Elizabeth			The canary in the coalmine; bee declines as an indicator of environmental health	SCIENCE PROGRESS			English	Review							POLLINATION SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRUIT-SET; HONEY; BIODIVERSITY; BUMBLEBEES; ECOLOGY; COMMON; UK; HOMOGENIZATION	Bee declines have received much attention of late, but there is considerable debate and confusion as to the extent, significance and causes of declines. In part, this reflects conflation of data for domestic honeybees, numbers of which are largely driven by economic factors, with those for wild bees, many of which have undergone marked range contractions but for the majority of which we have no good data on population size. There is no doubt that bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined along with availability of suitable nest sites, bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites and pathogens accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future, particularly for cool climate specialists such as bumblebees. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple, interacting stressors is driving honeybee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators. Bees have a high profile and so their travails attract attention, but these same stressors undoubtedly bear upon other wild organisms, many of which are not monitored and have few champions. Those wild insects for which we do have population data (notably butterflies and moths) are overwhelmingly also in decline. We argue that bee declines are indicators of pervasive and ongoing environmental damage that is likely to impact broadly on biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides.

The biofungicide Prestop-Mix, which contains Gliocladium catenulatum, is effective against Botrytis infections; however, the need for frequent applications increases the costs for farmers. Here, we demonstrate that bumble bees, Bombus terrestris L., effectively disseminate the preparation onto flowers in open field conditions. Over the course of three years, we found a highly significant decrease in the rate of Botrytis infection. Pathogen control was achieved with relatively low numbers of G. catenulatum spores per flower, even using flowers that are not highly attractive to bumble bees. An even distribution of spores was detected up to 100 m from the hives, either due to primary inoculation by bumble bees or secondary distribution by other flower visitors such as honey bees and solitary bees. We showed that the application of a biocontrol agent by bumble bees is reliable for the use of environmentally friendly pest control strategies in northern climatic conditions. This low cost technology is especially relevant for organic farming. This study provides valuable information for introducing this method into practice in open strawberry fields.

In this project we worked with Bombus terrestris, which is one of the most numerous bumblebee species in Europe and an important pollinator for wild flowers and many crops in agriculture. Besides the classic symptoms of paralysis and trembling prior to death, we report a new IAPV-related symptom, crippled/immobilized forelegs. Reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR showed that IAPV accumulates in different body tissues (midgut, fat body, brain and ovary). The highest levels of IAPV were observed in the fat body. With fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) we detected IAPV in the Kenyon cells of mushroom bodies and neuropils from both antennal and optic lobes of the brain in IAPV-infected workers. Finally, we observed an induction of Dicer-2, a core gene of the RNAi antiviral immune response, in the IAPV-infected tissues of B. terrestris workers. According to our results, tissue tropism and the induction strength of Dicer-2 could not be correlated with virus-related paralysis symptoms.

This native honey bee subspecies of Jordan expresses behavioral adaptations to high temperature and dry seasons typical of the region. However, persistent honey bee imports of commercial breeder lines are endangering local honey bee population. This study reports the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to study the A. m. syriaca genome and to identify genetic factors possibly contributing toward mite resistance and other favorable traits. We obtained a total of 46.2 million raw reads by applying the NGS to sequence A. m. syriaca and used extensive bioinformatics approach to identify several candidate genes for Varroa mite resistance, behavioral and immune responses characteristic for these bees. As a part of characterizing the functional regulation of molecular genetic pathway, we have mapped the pathway genes potentially involved using information from Drosophila melanogaster and present possible functional changes implicated in responses to Varroa destructor mite infestation toward this. We performed in-depth functional annotation methods to identify similar to 600 candidates that are relevant, genes involved in pathways such as microbial recognition and phagocytosis, peptidoglycan recognition protein family, Gram negative binding protein family, phagocytosis receptors, serpins, Toll signaling pathway, Imd pathway, Tnf, JAK-STAT and MAPK pathway, heamatopioesis and cellular response pathways, antiviral, RNAi pathway, stress factors, etc. were selected. Finally, we have cataloged function-specific polymorphisms between A. mellifera and A. m. syriaca that could give better understanding of varroa mite resistance mechanisms and assist in breeding. We have identified immune related embryonic development (Cactus, Relish, dorsal, Ank2, baz), Varroa hygiene (NorpA2, Zasp, LanA, gasp, impl3) and Varroa resistance (Pug, pcmt, elk, elf3-s10, Dscam2, Dhc64C, gro, futsch) functional variations genes between A. mellifera and A. m. syriaca that could be used to develop an effective molecular tool for bee conservation and breeding programs to improve locally adapted strains such as syriaca and utilize their advantageous traits for the benefit of apiculture industry.

Impact of managed honey bee viruses on wild bees	CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY			English	Article							EMERGING INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; DEFORMED WING VIRUS; POPULATION BIOLOGY; PARASITIC MITE; COLONY LOSSES; PATHOGENS; POLLINATORS; DYNAMICS; IMMUNITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Several viruses found in the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) have recently been detected in other bee species, raising the possibility of spill-over from managed to wild bee species. Alternatively, these viruses may be shared generalists across flower-visiting insects. Here we explore the former hypothesis, pointing out weaknesses in the current evidence, particularly in relation to deformed wing virus (DWV), and highlighting research areas that may help test it. Data so far suggest that DWV spills over from managed to Wild bee species and has the potential to cause population decline. That DWV and other viruses of A. mellifera are found in other bee species needs to be considered for the sustainable management of bee populations.

Impacts of neonicotinoid use on long-term population changes in wild bees in England	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							COLONY GROWTH; POLLINATORS; DECLINES; EXPOSURE; BRITAIN; CONSERVATION; PESTICIDES; RESPONSES; TRENDS	Wild bee declines have been ascribed in part to neonicotinoid insecticides. While short-term laboratory studies on commercially bred species ( principally honeybees and bumblebees) have identified sub-lethal effects, there is no strong evidence linking these insecticides to losses of the majority of wild bee species. We relate 18 years of UK national wild bee distribution data for 62 species to amounts of neonicotinoid use in oilseed rape. Using a multi-species dynamic Bayesian occupancy analysis, we find evidence of increased population extinction rates in response to neonicotinoid seed treatment use on oilseed rape. Species foraging on oilseed rape benefit from the cover of this crop, but were on average three times more negatively affected by exposure to neonicotinoids than non-crop foragers. Our results suggest that sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids could scale up to cause losses of bee biodiversity. Restrictions on neonicotinoid use may reduce population declines.

The neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, affects Bombus impatiens (bumblebee) sonication behavior when consumed at doses below the LD50	ECOTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Buzz pollination; Native bees; Pollination; Solanum; Tomato; Vibration	CHRONIC TOXICITY; POLLEN; BEES; EXPOSURE; SURVIVAL; L.; INSECTICIDES; HYMENOPTERA; METABOLITES; NECTAR	We investigated changes in sonication (or buzz-pollination) behavior of Bombus impatiens bumblebees, after consumption of the neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid. We measured sonication frequency, sonication length, and flight (wing beat) frequency of marked bees collecting pollen from Solanum lycopsersicum (tomato), and then randomly assigned bees to consume 0, 0.0515, 0.515, or 5.15 ng of imidacloprid. We recorded the number of bees in each treatment group that resumed sonication behavior after consuming imidacloprid, and re-measured sonication and flight behavior for these bees. We did not find evidence that consuming 0.0515 ng imidacloprid affected the sonication length, sonication frequency, or flight frequency for bees that sonicated after consuming imidacloprid; we were unable to test changes in these variables for bees that consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng because we did not observe enough of these bees sonicating after treatment. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression to determine whether consuming imidacloprid affected the probability of engaging in further sonication behavior on S. lycopersicum and found that bumblebees who consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng of imidacloprid were significantly less likely to sonicate after treatment than bees who consumed no imidacloprid. At the end of the experiment, we classified bees as dead or alive; our data suggest a trend of increasing mortality with higher doses of imidacloprid. Our results show that even modest doses of imidacloprid can significantly affect the likelihood of bumblebees engaging in sonication, a behavior critical for the pollination of a variety of crops and other plants.

Neonicotinoid insecticides can serve as inadvertent insect contraceptives	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Apis mellifera; insecticide; pollination; reproduction; sperm; sub-lethal	HONEY-BEE COLONY; APIS-MELLIFERA; SEXUAL SELECTION; EXTREME POLYANDRY; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; VARROA-DESTRUCTOR; GENETIC DIVERSITY; MATING FREQUENCY; SPERM VIABILITY; SEMEN QUALITY	There is clear evidence for sublethal effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on non-target ecosystem service-providing insects. However, their possible impact on male insect reproduction is currently unknown, despite the key role of sex. Here, we show that two neonicotinoids (4.5 ppb thiamethoxam and 1.5 ppb dothianidin) significantly reduce the reproductive capacity of male honeybees (drones), Apis mellifera. Drones were obtained from colonies exposed to the neonicotinoid insecticides or controls, and subsequently maintained in laboratory cages until they reached sexual maturity. While no significant effects were observed for male teneral (newly emerged adult) body mass and sperm quantity, the data dearly showed reduced drone lifespan, as well as reduced sperm viability (percentage living versus dead) and living sperm quantity by 39%. Our results demonstrate for the first time that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect male insect reproductive capacity, and provide a possible mechanistic explanation for managed honeybee queen failure and wild insect pollinator decline. The widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoids may have previously overlooked inadvertent contraceptive effects on non-target insects, thereby limiting conservation efforts.

Complementary pollination services are also provided by wild bees, yet highbush blueberry is increasingly grown in regions outside its native range where wild bee communities may be less adapted to the crop and growers may still be testing appropriate honey bee stocking densities. To contrast crop pollination in native and non-native production regions, we sampled commercial 'Bluecrop' blueberry fields in British Columbia and Michigan with grower-selected honey bee stocking rates (0-39.5 hives per ha) to compare bee visitors to blueberry flowers, pollination and yield deficits, and how those vary with local-and landscape-scale factors. Observed and Chao-1 estimated species richness, as well as Shannon diversity of wild bees visiting blueberries were significantly higher in Michigan where the crop is within its native range. The regional bee communities were also significantly different, with Michigan farms having greater dissimilarity than British Columbia. Blueberry fields in British Columbia had fewer visits by honey bees than those in Michigan, irrespective of stocking rate, and they also had lower berry weights and a significant pollination deficit. In British Columbia, pollination service increased with abundance of wild bumble bees, whereas in Michigan the abundance of honey bees was the primary predictor of pollination. The proportion of seminatural habitat at local and landscape scales was positively correlated with wild bee abundance in both regions. Wild bee abundance declined significantly with distance from natural borders in Michigan, but not in British Columbia where large-bodied bumble bees dominated the wild bee community. Our results highlight the varying dependence of crop production on different types of bees and reveal that strategies for pollination improvement in the same crop can vary greatly across production regions.

J	Meurgey, F				Meurgey, Francois			Bee species and their associated flowers in the French West Indies (Guadeloupe, Les Saintes, La Desirade, Marie Galante, St Barthelemy and Martinique) (Hymenoptera: Anthophila: Apoidea)	ANNALES DE LA SOCIETE ENTOMOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE			English	Article						Faunistics; floral hosts; Antilles	MEGACHILIDAE; POLLINATORS; PATTERNS; CONSERVATION; CHECKLIST; ANTILLES; ECOLOGY	A list of 25 bee species in the families Apidae and Megachilidae is provided for the French West Indies (FWI) along with floral host records from 260 plant species in 71 families. Four species are newly recorded for some islands, as follows: Coelioxys abdominalis Guerin, 1844, new island record for Marie-Galante and Martinique, Centris decolorata Lepeletier, 1841, new island record for Marie-Galante, Melissodes rufodentatus Smith, 1854, is newly recorded from Guadeloupe and Mesoplia azurea (Lepeletier & Serville, 1825) from La Desirade. The bee fauna of the FWI is mostly composed of species that occur (or may be expected to occur) throughout much of the West Indies, combined with species that are widely distributed on the mainland and a proportion of regionally endemic species. In addition to these elements, there appear to be at least a few locally endemic species. A few species of bees appear to be oligolectic; their host plants, however, are visited by a wide variety of bees and other insects. There is only one intentionally introduced bee in Guadeloupe, the European honey bee Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758, and three non-native bees that reached the FWI from other parts of the Caribbean and the mainland: Megachile (Pseudomegachile) lanata (Fabricius, 1775), M. (Callomegachile) rufipennis (Fabricius, 1793) and M. (Eutricharaea) concinna Smith, 1879. Honey bees are often extremely abundant, and dominate nectar and pollen resources in ways that are disruptive to native bees. Although it is easy to observe individual honey bees displacing individual native bees on flowers, there are no data on the ecological effects of honey bees on native pollinators in the FWI.

Patterns of Floral Visitation to Native Hawaiian Plants in Presence and Absence of Invasive Argentine Ants	PACIFIC SCIENCE			English	Article							BEES HYMENOPTERA; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; SAMPLING TECHNIQUES; HONEY-BEES; SEED SET; CONSEQUENCES; MUTUALISM; ELEVATION; APOIDEA; CARYOPHYLLACEAE	Invasive ants can influence abundance and diversity of insect pollinators, and this effect may be expected to be especially strong on oceanic islands. We examined abundance of native Hylaeus bees and patterns of flower visitation to three native Hawaiian plant species (Leptecophylla tameiameiae, Santalum haleakalae, and Geranium cuneatum) in presence and absence of invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in the subalpine shrubland of Haleakala volcano. Native bees, nonnative honeybees, and microlepidoptera were responsible for the majority of visits to flowers of the three plant species. Ants visited flowers of S. haleakalae and G. cuneatum relatively commonly in ant-invaded zones but were less common or absent on flowers of L. tameiameiae in the same zones. Zones with ants had fewer Hylaeus bees in yellow pan traps than the zone without ants, and overall flower visitation rates to one plant species, G. cuneatum, were six times lower in sites containing ants. In one of two observation years, flower visitation to L. tameiameiae was also reduced in sites containing ants. Results suggest that Argentine ants may cause a reduction of native Hylaeus bee abundances; however, other factors correlated with elevation cannot be ruled out as the cause of differences in Hylaeus abundances across our sites.

J	Albrecht, M; Ramis, MR; Traveset, A				Albrecht, Matthias; Ramis, Margarita R.; Traveset, Anna			Pollinator-mediated impacts of alien invasive plants on the pollination of native plants: the role of spatial scale and distinct behaviour among pollinator guilds	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Exotic species invasion; Facilitation; Magnet plant effect; Plant reproductive success; Plant-pollinator interactions; Competition for pollinators	REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; CARPOBROTUS SPP.; POLLEN TRANSFER; COMPETITION; VISITATION; DIVERSITY; MECHANISM; PATTERNS; SERVICE	Alien invasive plant species can affect pollination, reproductive success and population dynamics of co-flowering native species via shared pollinators. Consequences may range from reproductive competition to facilitation, but the ecological drivers determining the type and magnitude of such indirect interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the role of the spatial scale of invader presence and spatially contingent behavioural responses of different pollinator groups as potential key drivers, using the invasive Oxalis pes-caprae and the self-incompatible native annual Diplotaxis erucoides as a model system. Three treatments were assigned to native focal plants: (1) invader present at the landscape scale (hectares) but experimentally removed at the floral neighbourhood scale (pa); (2) invader present at both scales (pp); (3) invader absent at both scales (aa). Interestingly, we found pronounced spatially contingent differences in the responses of pollinators: honeybees and bumblebees were strongly attracted into invaded sites at the landscape scale, translating into native plant visitation facilitation through honeybees, while bumblebees almost exclusively visited Oxalis. Non-corbiculate wild bees, in contrast, showed less pronounced responses in foraging behavior, primarily at the floral neighborhood scale. Average heterospecific (Oxalis) pollen deposition onto stigmas of Diplotaxis was low (<1 %), but higher in the pp than in the pa treatment. Hand-pollination of Diplotaxis with Oxalis and conspecific pollen, however, reduced seed set by more than half when compared to hand-pollination with only conspecific pollen. Seed set of Diplotaxis, finally, was increased by 14 % (reproductive facilitation) in the pp treatment, while it was reduced by 27 % (reproductive competition) in the pa treatment compared to uninvaded populations. Our study highlights the crucial role of spatial scale and pollinator guild driving indirect effects of invasive on co-flowering native plant species.

Despite their ecological importance, few studies have investigated patterns of spatial variation in toxic nectar compounds in plant species, and none outside their native range. Grayanotoxin I (GTX I) occurs in nectar of invasive Rhododendron ponticum where it is toxic to honeybees and some solitary bee species. We examined (i) geographic variation in the composition of nectar GTX I, as well as GTX III (which is not toxic to these species), in the native and introduced range of R.ponticum, (ii) how their expression is structured at patch and landscape scales within ranges, and (iii) whether climatic and environmental factors underpin spatial patterns. While both GTXs varied within ranges, variation in GTX I, but not GTX III, was detected between ranges. GTX I expression was thus markedly lower or (in 18% of cases) absent from nectar in introduced plants. Spatial autocorrelation was apparent at both patch and landscape scales and in part related to heat load interception by plants (a function of latitude, aspect and slope). As expression of nectar GTXs was generally robust to environmental variation, and aggregated in space, this trait has the potential to be spatially discriminated by consumers. Given the specificity of change to GTX I, and its differential toxicity to some bee species, we conclude that its expression was likely to have been influenced during invasion by interaction with herbivores/consumers, either via pollinator-mediated selection or enemy release from floral antagonists.Synthesis. As the first demonstration of large-scale geographic variation and spatial structure in toxic nectar compounds, this work deepens our understanding of the chemical ecology of floral interactions in native and introduced species. Spatially explicit studies of nectar secondary compounds are thus required to show how the extent and structure of spatial variation may affect floral ecology. Future development of invasion theory should incorporate a holistic view of plant defence, beyond antagonistic interactions, which integrates the consequences of chemically defended mutualist rewards.

Pollination services enhanced with urbanization despite increasing pollinator parasitism	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Bombus; Crithidia bombi; Nosema bombi; local habitat; land-use change; plant-animal interactions	BEES BOMBUS SPP.; BUMBLE BEES; NOSEMA-BOMBI; HYMENOPTERA; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; PREVALENCE; PRESSURES; PLANTS; SCALE	Animal-mediated pollination is required for the reproduction of the majority of angiosperms, and pollinators are therefore essential for ecosystem functioning and the economy. Two major threats to insect pollinators are anthropogenic land-use change and the spread of pathogens, whose effects may interact to impact pollination. Here, we investigated the relative effects on the ecosystem service of pollination of (i) land-use change brought on by agriculture and urbanization as well as (ii) the prevalence of pollinator parasites, using experimental insect pollinator-dependent plant species in natural pollinator communities. We found that pollinator habitat (i.e. availability of nesting resources for ground-nesting bees and local flower richness) was strongly related to flower visitation rates at the local scale and indirectly influenced plant pollination success. At the landscape scale, pollination was positively related to urbanization, both directly and indirectly via elevated visitation rates. Bumblebees were the most abundant pollinator group visiting experimental flowers. Prevalence of trypanosomatids, such as the common bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi, was higher in urban compared with agricultural areas, a relationship which was mediated through higher Bombus abundance. Yet, we did not find any top-down, negative effects of bumblebee parasitism on pollination. We conclude that urban areas can be places of high transmission of both pollen and pathogens.

Specifically, pollination treatment by honey bee or mining bee species was applied to female flowers of a watermelon plant. There were also three other treatments; a no-visit treatment, an open-pollinated treatment and a 'hand' pollination treatment. Comparisons were based on the number of single bee visits to treated flowers, fruit abortion rates, seed sets as influenced by bee type and the quality characteristics of the developed fruit. The main representative genus of wild bees in the studied area was Lasioglossum. Whilst it was possible that a single visit from either bee type effected pollination, wild bees needed a significantly lower mean number of visits to effect pollination than honey bees. In particular they spent three times as long at each flower compared to Apis mellifera. None of the studied quality characteristics of the developed watermelon fruits (mean weight, brix, number of seeds per fruit and weight of seed) differed significantly for both tested pollinators. The current study provides theoretical and practical evidence to the growers of watermelon crop of the existence of alternative pollinator species that can be targeted for development and management because of their high pollination efficiencies. Therefore the results support the hypothesis that the native bee community can provide an equivalent service to that of managed honey bee pollinators for watermelon, a crop that has heavy pollination requirements.

J	Bahlai, CA; Landis, DA				Bahlai, Christie A.; Landis, Douglas A.			Predicting plant attractiveness to pollinators with passive crowdsourcing	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						bee; data mining; nectar; pollination; search engine	NATURAL ENEMIES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CITIZEN-SCIENCE; MONITORING DATA; NATIVE PLANTS; CONSERVATION; WILD; ABUNDANCE; BEES; HONEYBEES	Global concern regarding pollinator decline has intensified interest in enhancing pollinator resources in managed landscapes. These efforts frequently emphasize restoration or planting of flowering plants to provide pollen and nectar resources that are highly attractive to the desired pollinators. However, determining exactly which plant species should be used to enhance a landscape is difficult. Empirical screening of plants for such purposes is logistically daunting, but could be streamlined by crowdsourcing data to create lists of plants most probable to attract the desired pollinator taxa. People frequently photograph plants in bloom and the Internet has become a vast repository of such images. A proportion of these images also capture floral visitation by arthropods. Here, we test the hypothesis that the abundance of floral images containing identifiable pollinator and other beneficial insects is positively associated with the observed attractiveness of the same species in controlled field trials from previously published studies. We used Google Image searches to determine the correlation of pollinator visitation captured by photographs on the Internet relative to the attractiveness of the same species in common-garden field trials for 43 plant species. From the first 30 photographs, which successfully identified the plant, we recorded the number of Apis (managed honeybees), non-Apis (exclusively wild bees) and the number of bee-mimicking syrphid flies. We used these observations from search hits as well as bloom period (BP) as predictor variables in Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for field-observed abundances of each of these groups. We found that non-Apis bees observed in controlled field trials were positively associated with observations of these taxa in Google Image searches (pseudo-R-2 of 0.668). Syrphid fly observations in the field were also associated with the frequency they were observed in images, but this relationship was weak. Apis bee observations were not associated with Internet images, but were slightly associated with BP. Our results suggest that passively crowdsourced image data can potentially be a useful screening tool to identify candidate plants for pollinator habitat restoration efforts directed at wild bee conservation.

Pest Control and Pollination Cost-Benefit Analysis of Hedgerow Restoration in a Simplified Agricultural Landscape	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						hedgerow; pest control; pollination; economics	WILD BEE ABUNDANCE; QUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CROP POLLINATION; NATIVE BEES; FRUIT-SET; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; CALIFORNIA	Field edge habitat in homogeneous agricultural landscapes can serve multiple purposes including enhanced biodiversity, water quality protection, and habitat for beneficial insects, such as native bees and natural enemies. Despite this ecosystem service value, adoption of field border plantings, such as hedgerows, on large-scale mono-cropped farms is minimal. With profits primarily driving agricultural production, a major challenge affecting hedgerow plantings is linked to establishment costs and the lack of clear economic benefits on the restoration investment. Our study documented that hedgerows are economically viable to growers by enhancing beneficial insects and natural pest control and pollination on farms. With pest control alone, our model shows that it would take 16 yr to break even from insecticide savings on the US$ 4,000 cost of a typical 300-m hedgerow field edge planting. By adding in pollination benefits by native bees, where honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) may be limiting, the return time is reduced to 7 yr. USDA cost share programs allow for a quicker return on a hedgerow investment. Our study shows that over time, small-scale restoration can be profitable, helping to overcome the barrier of cost associated with field edge habitat restoration on farms.	[Morandin, L.

Besides the varroa mite, diseases and environmental toxins, lack of food is likely to be an important stress factor. For this reason, it is hoped that flower strips in the cultivated landscape will reduce the nectar dearth from late May to late July. From 2011 to 2015, flower-strip mixtures supplying pollen and nectar to honey bees and non-specialised bees during this summer gap, but which also appealed to agriculturally important beneficials such as hoverflies and predatory bugs, were developed at HAFL, the School of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences. A comparison with extensively managed meadows, fallow lands and margins revealed that flower strips offer nourishment to many honey bees and non specialised wild bees. In addition, a 2015 case study with bumblebees showed that the proximity of a flower strip has a positive influence on colony development. A further positive aspect of flower strips most likely also lies in the fact that they reduce food competition between honey bees and wild bees in the remaining flowering areas.

Flower visitors of wildflower plantings encompass many ecologically and economically important species. However, most studies on flower visitors of wildflower plantings have focused on single or few prominent taxa (e.g., wild bees and hoverflies). In contrast, it remains largely unresolved how non-prominent flower visitors of the community are affected by wildflower resources, landscape context and time of the flowering season. We studied highly diverse flower-visitor communities on 14 wildflower plantings varying in flower abundance and richness and their surrounding landscape context within a 500 m radius (percentage arable land, presence of additional wildflower plantings). Flower visitors were sampled in the early (May-June) and late (June-July) flowering season and grouped as follows: managed honeybees, wild bees, hoverflies, all other flower visitors. Strikingly, only 81 (25.1%) of all 322 visiting species (<50.0% of individuals) were bees or hoverflies, and 241 non-prominent 'other' visitor taxa were sampled, encompassing many ecologically and economically important species, e.g., parasitic wasps and non-syrphid Diptera. With the exception of honeybee abundance that was positively related to flower abundance, flower abundance and richness of wildflower plantings affected neither abundance nor richness of any visitor group. While a high amount of surrounding arable land decreased species richness of wild bees, richness of all other groups was unaffected. In contrast to the relatively weak abundance and richness responses at the group-level, we found strong species-specific responses to landscape context, resulting in substantial spatial and temporal turnover in community composition. In the early flowering season, wildflower plantings that were accompanied by additional local plantings and embedded within complex landscapes supported the highest abundances of habitat specialists (e.g. Bombus spp.), whereas isolated plantings were predominantly visited by agricultural generalists (e.g. predatory hoverflies and pollen beetles). These compositional differences diminished towards the end of the flowering season. Our study highlights the great conservation potential of wildflower plantings in agricultural landscapes. With the exception of wild bees, wildflower plantings support a high diversity of functionallycomplementary flower-visitor species from complex to structurally simple agricultural landscapes. These so-far overlooked flower visitors may have the potential to provide complementary ecosystem services and to step-in in agricultural settings where prominent providers have been lost. Assessments of the value of wildflower plantings to biodiversity conservation and agriculture require a shift away from solely focusing on prominent taxa and towards a more holistic appreciation of the entire flower-visitor community.

Nectar chemistry modulates the impact of an invasive plant on native pollinators	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						invasive alien plants; multiple stressors; Rhododendron ponticum; secondary compounds; toxic nectar	RHODODENDRON-PONTICUM; INSECT; HONEY; DETOXIFICATION; PRESSURES; TOXICITY; DANCE	1. Invasive species are considered a main driver of pollinator declines, yet the direct effects of invasive alien plants on pollinators are poorly understood. 2. Abundant, invasive plant species can provide a copious nectar resource for native pollinators. However, the nectar of some plants contains secondary compounds, usually associated with defence against herbivores. The impacts of these compounds on pollinators are often unknown. 3. We compared how consumption of grayanotoxin I and III, natural secondary compounds in the nectar of invasive Rhododendron ponticum L., affected three native bee species: a honeybee, (Apis mellifera L.), a solitary mining bee (Andrena carantonica, Perez) and a bumblebee, (Bombus terrestris, L.). 4. Survival of the solitary bee and the bumblebee species was not affected by either grayanotoxin, but honeybees were similar to 20x more likely to die when fed solutions containing grayanotoxin I. Furthermore, solitary bees were deterred from feeding and exhibited malaise behaviours indicative of sublethal toxicity in response to consumption of grayanotoxin I. In contrast, grayanotoxins did not affect bumblebee survival or behaviour, even when bees were subjected to multiple stressors (parasite infection or food stress). 5. Our experiments suggest that while R. ponticum provides abundant floral nectar, it is only available as a food resource to pollinators that tolerate grayanotoxins. Pollinators whose health is negatively affected by grayanotoxins may experience negative impacts from R. ponticum invasion directly (if they consume R. ponticum nectar) or indirectly (if native floral resources are replaced by R. ponticum). 6. Our study makes a novel comparison of the effects of a natural nectar secondary compound on three pollinator species and clearly demonstrates drastic variation in the responses of different key pollinator taxa to a nectar toxin. Our findings are thus in congruence with literature demonstrating the varying effects of invasive plant chemistry on native foliar herbivores, and our work demonstrates that nectar chemistry should be taken into account when determining the impacts of plant invasion for native pollinators.

They have been introduced on an almost worldwide scale. During recent years, however, several studies argue their possible competition with unmanaged pollinators. Here we examine the possible effects of honey bees on the foraging behaviour of wild bees on Cistus creticus flowers in Northern Greece. We gradually introduced one, five, and eight honey-bee hives per site, each containing ca. 20,000 workers. The visitation frequency and visit duration of wild bees before and after the beehive introductions were measured by flower observation. While the visitation frequencies of wild bees were unaffected, the average time wild bees spent on C. creticus increased with the introduction of the honey-bee hives. Although competition between honey bees and wild bees is often expected, we did not find any clear evidence for significant effects even in honey-bee densities much higher than the European-wide average of 3.1 colonies/km(2).

Apple Pollination: Demand Depends on Variety and Supply Depends on Pollinator Identity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FRUIT-SET; BEE; HYMENOPTERA; LANDSCAPES; HONEYBEE; YIELD; AGROECOSYSTEMS; MEGACHILIDAE; DIVERSITY	Insect pollination underpins apple production but the extent to which different pollinator guilds supply this service, particularly across different apple varieties, is unknown. Such information is essential if appropriate orchard management practices are to be targeted and proportional to the potential benefits pollinator species may provide. Here we use a novel combination of pollinator effectiveness assays (floral visit effectiveness), orchard field surveys (flower visitation rate) and pollinator dependence manipulations (pollinator exclusion experiments) to quantify the supply of pollination services provided by four different pollinator guilds to the production of four commercial varieties of apple. We show that not all pollinators are equally effective at pollinating apples, with hoverflies being less effective than solitary bees and bumblebees, and the relative abundance of different pollinator guilds visiting apple flowers of different varieties varies significantly. Based on this, the taxa specific economic benefits to UK apple production have been established. The contribution of insect pollinators to the economic output in all varieties was estimated to be 92.1M pound across the UK, with contributions varying widely across taxa: solitary bees (51.4M) pound, honeybees (21.4M) pound, bumblebees (18.6M) pound and hoverflies (0.7M) pound. This research highlights the differences in the economic benefits of four insect pollinator guilds to four major apple varieties in the UK. This information is essential to underpin appropriate investment in pollination services management and provides a model that can be used in other entomolophilous crops to improve our understanding of crop pollination ecology.

J	Downing, J; Borrero, H; Liu, H				Downing, Jason; Borrero, Haydee; Liu, Hong			Differential impacts from an extreme cold spell on subtropical vs. tropical specialist bees in southern Florida	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						climate change; cold spell; ecological release; extreme weather; Special Feature: Extreme Cold Spells; specialist bees; subtropics	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL RELEASE; CENTRIS-NITIDA; WEATHER; POLLINATOR; RESPONSES; EVENTS; TRENDS; RANGE	Gradual warming and changes in extreme weather patterns associated with human induced climate change are altering the range distributions of species. However, species responses to climate change are predicted to be more strongly affected by extreme events than by changes in mean values. As a result, measuring species' responses to extreme events in addition to the mean changes in climate are necessary to predict species range limits under future conditions. This study examines the impacts of a cold spell in southern Florida on native and an introduced oil-collecting bees by examining the bees' interactions with two native plants species. Our results provide evidence of differential impacts from an extreme cold event on a native, subtropical bee vs. an introduced, tropical bee. Specifically, the cold spell had little impact on the abundance of the native bee, while the abundance of the introduced, tropical bee was negatively impacted. Our findings demonstrate that extreme cold spells are important climate change-related phenomena that can have strong impacts on tropical species distributions and abundances, especially at the threshold of their thermal tolerances. Our approach also provided a rare opportunity to examine these impacts on multiple interacting species, which provides a more realistic assessment of the potential impacts of climate change.

We applied the InVEST Crop Pollination model, developed to predict native bee abundance from habitat resources, in Maine's wild blueberry crop landscape. We evaluated model performance with parameters informed by four approaches: 1) expert opinion; 2) sensitivity analysis.; 3) sensitivity analysis informed model optimization; and, 4) simulated annealing (uninformed) model optimization. Uninformed optimization improved model performance by 29% compared to expert opinion-informed model, while sensitivity-analysis informed optimization improved model performance by 54%. This suggests that expert opinion may not result in the best parameter values for the InVEST model. The proportion of deciduous/mixed forest within 2000 m of a blueberry field also reliably predicted native bee abundance in blueberry fields, however, the InVEST model provides an efficient tool to estimate bee abundance beyond the field perimeter.

J	Norfolk, O; Eichhorn, MP; Gilbert, F				Norfolk, Olivia; Eichhorn, Markus P.; Gilbert, Francis			Flowering ground vegetation benefits wild pollinators and fruit set of almond within arid smallholder orchards	INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY			English	Article						Agriculture; conservation; ecosystem service; Egypt; pollination; yield	APIS-MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA; OSMIA-CORNUTA; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; FLORAL RESOURCES; FARMING SYSTEMS; MEGACHILIDAE; COMMUNITIES; ECOLOGY; APIDAE	1. Pollination studies tend to focus on the conventional agriculture associated with Europe and the USA, leaving a gap in our understanding of how pollination services are maintained in smallholder agricultural systems that dominate much of the developing world. 2. In South Sinai, Egypt, almond is cultivated as part of an arid agroforestry system in traditional orchard gardens that contain a mixture of fruit trees inter-planted with vegetables and herbs. This study investigated the relative contribution of honeybees and wild insects for pollination of almond trees and assessed how flowering ground vegetation influenced pollinator densities and fruit set. 3. Results showed that almond was highly dependent on insect pollination, with bagged flowers producing less than 8% of the fruit set of insect- and hand-pollinated flowers. Fruit set was correlated with wild pollinator visitation, but not with honeybee visitation. Furthermore, the presence of honeybee hives had no effect upon fruit set. 4. The abundance and species richness of flowering ground vegetation was positively related to pollinator abundance within the gardens and associated with enhanced fruit set. Over half of the flowering ground flora were minority crops grown alongside almond, suggesting that facilitation can occur between simultaneously flowering crops. 5. In these diverse orchard gardens, flowering minority crops benefited wild pollinators and increased fruit set in the primary orchard crop. If mutual facilitation occurs between other crop species, then the diverse cropping systems associated with smallholder farms are likely to enhance pollination services within traditional agricultural landscapes.

Flowering crops offer pulsed and abundant floral resources (i.e., mass flowering crops) that might promote pollinator spill-over between cultivated and adjacent natural areas. We explored pollinator patterns in the mass flowering legume crop Hedysarum coronarium and its influence on the bee pollinator communities of adjacent shrublands in a heterogeneous and patchy agricultural landscape: We studied the temporal (i.e., during vs. after mass flowering in adjacent shrublands) and spatial (i.e., inside crops, adjacent and distant shrublands during mass flowering) functional pollinator spill-over. The honeybee was highly attracted to Hedysarum crops, yet its abundance and that of other bee species visiting native plants in adjacent shrublands did not differ during and after Hedysarum mass flowering. However, at the landscape scale, the honeybee and the other bee species were less abundant in shrublands adjacent to Hedysarum crops compared to distant ones; their visitation rates showing a similar trend. These results show that some mass flowering crops can influence pollinator patterns in the surrounding landscape by competing for generalist pollinators with native plants. The characteristics of the crop species and the landscape can modulate and determine the role of mass flowering crops as competitors or supporters of wild pollinators for adjacent natural areas.

The SHB has recently become an invasive species, and introductions have been recorded from America, Australia, Europe and Asia since 1996. While SHBs are usually considered a minor pest in Africa, they can cause significant damage to social bee colonies in their new ranges. Potential reasons for differential impact include differences in bee behaviour, climate and release from natural enemies. Here, we provide an overview on biology, distribution, pest status, diagnosis, control and prevention to foster adequate mitigation and stimulate future research. SHBs have become a global threat to both apiculture and wild bee populations, but our knowledge of this pest is still limited, creating demand for more research in all areas of its biology.

However, high honey bee densities may have an impact on local pollen and nectar availability, which in turn may negatively affect other pollinators. This is exacerbated by the ability of honey bees to recruit foragers to highly rewarding flower patches. We measured floral resource consumption in rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) in 21 plots located at different distances from apiaries in the scrubland of Garraf Natural Park (Barcelona), and related these measures to visitation rates of honey bees, bumblebees (Bombes terrestris) and other pollinators. In the same plots, we measured flower density, and used pan traps to characterize the wild bee community. Flower resource consumption was largely explained by honey bee visitation and marginally by bumblebee visitation. Ada accounting for flower density, plots close to apiaries had lower wild bee biomass. This was due to a lower abundance of large bee species, those more likely to be affected by honey bee competition+ We conclude that honey bees are the main contributors to pollen/nectar consumption of the two main dowering plants in the scrubland, and that at the densities currently occurring in the park (3.5 hives/km(2)) the wild bee community is being affected. Our study supports the hypothesis that high honey bee densities may have an impact on other pollinators via competition for flower resources.

Hygienic food to reduce pathogen risk to bumblebees	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Commercially produced bumblebees; Disease; Pollination services; Bombus; Apicystis; Pollen	ACUTE PARALYSIS VIRUS; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; WILD POLLINATORS; GAMMA-IRRADIATION; BEE; PARASITES; SPILLOVER; DECLINES; TRANSMISSION; COLONIES	Bumblebees are ecologically and economically important pollinators, and the value of bumblebees for crop pollination has led to the commercial production and exportation/importation of colonies on a global scale. Commercially produced bumblebee colonies can carry with them infectious parasites, which can both reduce the health of the colonies and spillover to wild bees, with potentially serious consequences. The presence of parasites in commercially produced bumblebee colonies is in part because colonies are reared on pollen collected from honey bees, which often contains a diversity of microbial parasites. In response to this threat, part of the industry has started to irradiate pollen used for bumblebee rearing. However, to date there is limited data published on the efficacy of this treatment. Here we examine the effect of gamma irradiation and an experimental ozone treatment on the presence and viability of parasites in honey bee pollen. While untreated pollen contained numerous viable parasites, we find that gamma irradiation reduced the viability of parasites in pollen, but did not eliminate parasites entirely. Ozone treatment appeared to be less effective than gamma irradiation, while an artificial pollen substitute was, as expected, entirely free of parasites. The results suggest that the irradiation of pollen before using it to rear bumblebee colonies is a sensible method which will help reduce the incidence of parasite infections in commercially produced bumblebee colonies, but that further optimisation, or the use of a nutritionally equivalent artificial pollen substitute, may be needed to fully eliminate this route of disease entry into factories.

PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA			Portuguese	Review						Apis mellifera; Africanized honey bees; colony collapse disorder; bee nutrition; honey bee health; pollination	MELIPONA-SCUTELLARIS LATREILLE; AFRICANIZED HONEY-BEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; NOSEMA-CERANAE; NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDE; TOXICITY; HYMENOPTERA; NUTRITION; LOSSES; INSECTICIDE	In the last decades, the decline of wild bee populations and the collapse of Apis mellifera colonies have concerned researchers and beekeepers. The objective of this review was to compile some of the most relevant studies related to the possible causes of these problems such as nutrition, management, pathogens, parasites, and the effects of pesticides, besides presenting a brief history of the colony collapse disorder syndrome (CCD) in the United States and Europe. The studies developed in Brazil were presented in more detail, mainly those on pesticides used in agriculture and on pathogens and parasites that attack the colonies of Africanized A. mellifera. Cases of weakening, decline, and collapse have been recorded in Brazil, mainly in the states of Sao Paulo and Santa Catarina, which add up to great losses. Results of the analyzed occurrences indicated that the recorded mass mortalities were not associated with pathogens or parasites. Only two cases with characteristics similar to those described for CCD were recorded, but without defined causes. In order to know the causes of the weakening and collapses of colonies, the implementation of official programs is urgent for the systematic survey of bee health, associated with research focusing on assessments of possible impacts of habitat fragmentation and agricultural practices on bee communities.

However, whether C-a-induced declines in nutritional quality are also occurring for pollinator food sources is unknown. Flowering late in the season, goldenrod (Solidago spp.) pollen is a widely available autumnal food source commonly acknowledged by apiarists to be essential to native bee (e.g. Bombus spp.) and honeybee (Apis mellifera) health and winter survival. Using floral collections obtained from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, we quantified C-a-induced temporal changes in pollen protein concentration of Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), the most widespread Solidago taxon, from hundreds of samples collected throughout the USA and southern Canada over the period 1842-2014 (i.e. a C-a from approx. 280 to 398 ppm). In addition, we conducted a 2 year in situ trial of S. canadensis populations grown along a continuous C-a gradient from approximately 280 to 500 ppm. The historical data indicated a strong significant correlation between recent increases in Ca and reductions in pollen protein concentration (r(2) = 0.81). Experimental data confirmed this decrease in pollen protein concentration, and indicated that it would be ongoing as C-a continues to rise in the near term, i.e. to MO ppm (r(2) = 0.88). While additional data are needed to quantify the subsequent effects of reduced protein concentration for Canada goldenrod on bee health and population stability, these results are the first to indicate that increasing C-a can reduce protein content of a floral pollen source widely used by North American bees.

Mass Flowering Crops as a Conservation Resource for Wild Pollinators (Hymenoptera: Apoidea)	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Sunflower; Bombus; ecosystem services; habitat management	BEE ABUNDANCE; BUMBLE BEES; SERVICES; DECLINE; BOMBUS; AGROECOSYSTEMS; SUNFLOWERS; PHENOLOGY; FARMLAND; APIDAE	Habitat management within agroecosystems can conserve wild pollinator communities by providing nesting and floral resources. However, demarcating arable land for conservation may reduce farm income. A conciliatory habitat management plan thus consists of planting harvestable commodities which offer pollinator resources. This study's goal was to determine whether a single species annual flowering crop could support an abundant and diverse wild pollinator community despite its own uniformity. Local bee communities were sampled using pan traps and hand collection within sixty 10 m(2) plots of a sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., field and thirty 10 m(2) plots within a meadow three times throughout August, 2012. In total, 2316 bees were collected with Bombus impatiens Cresson constituting 81.5% of sampled bees. Examined collectively, hand collections yielded significantly higher bee abundances in the sunflower field (P < 0.01) across every sampling date. Conversely, an equivalent number of pan-trapped bees occurred among habitats for all sampling dates except week three (P = 0.02) when a greater abundance was observed in the sunflower habitat. Species diversity did not differ (P-hand = 0.99, P-pan = 0.97) between habitats although community composition differed with high significance (P < 0.01) indicating that these habitats had comparable diversity levels but attracted particular bee assemblages. Our study identifies sunflower crops as useful pollinator resources, especially for Bombus species, and provides insight into single species annual crops' potential contribution to pollinator conservation.

Summaries for each crop are used to generate mean proportions of bee visitation by categories of bees. This shows that native bee visits often occur as frequently, or in greater proportions than non-native honey bee visits. Visitation across multiple crops is then analyzed together with nonmetric multidimensional scaling to show how communities of bees that provide crop pollination change depending on the crop. Within squash and pumpkin plantings, continuous and discrete factors, such as "time of day" and "organic practices," further explain shifts in the community composition of flower visitors. Results from this study show that native bees frequently visit flowers on various crops, indicating that they are likely contributing to pollination services in addition to honey bees. Furthermore, the community of bees visiting flowers changes based on crop type, phenology, and spatial-temporal factors. Results suggest that developing pollinator conservation for farms that grow a wide variety of crops will likely require multiple conservation strategies. Farms that concentrate on a single crop may be able to tailor conservation practices toward the most important bees in their system and geographic locale.

Breeding system of the critically endangered Lakela's Mint and influence of plant height on pollinators and seed output	POPULATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						Agamospermy; Apis mellifera; Bombus impatiens; Cross-pollination; Dicerandra immaculata; Self-pollination	INTRODUCED HONEY-BEES; FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE; POLLEN-LIMITATION; FLOWERING PLANTS; MATING SYSTEMS; FLORIDA SCRUB; FRUIT-SET; REPRODUCTION; LIMITS; PATTERNS	Understanding reproductive systems of rare plants is critical for conservation efforts. Lakela's Mint, Dicerandra immaculata Lakela var. immaculata, is an endangered plant endemic to an approximately 4.8-km long area in Florida, USA. We used an experimental garden and three populations of Lakela's Mint to determine: (1) what is the breeding system (autonomous, asexual, self-fertile, cross-fertile) and are insects necessary for reproduction; (2) which native and nonnative insect species visit flowers and is the frequency of visits to a plant influenced by its height; (3) does the number of flowers visited within a plant by individual insects differ among native and nonnative insect species and due to plant height; and (4) is seed output influenced by plant height? Our results indicate that the breeding system of Lakela's Mint was facultative outcrossing. Insect-pollinated flowers produced more seeds than flowers that reproduced autonomously or asexually. The honey bee Apis mellifera L., a nonnative species, was the most frequent visitor to plants and visited more flowers within plants than native pollinators, but its behavior was not influenced by plant height. Native pollinators such as Bombus impatiens Cresson were attracted more frequently to shorter plants, but visited fewer flowers than on taller plants. Despite having fewer total and pollinated flowers, shorter plants had a higher output of intact seeds than taller plants, which could be due to differences in efficiency between native and nonnative pollinators or other factors. Our results add insight into factors influencing seed output and interactions between pollinators and rare plants.

Pollination services for apple are dependent on diverse wild bee communities	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agroecosystem; Native bees; Apple production; Seed set; Functional group; Apple orchards; Pollination	SEED NUMBER; FRUIT-SET; BIODIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA; COMPLEMENTARITY; INCREASES; ECOLOGY; TRENDS	Understanding the importance of biodiversity in applied settings is a central theme for ecologists. Pollination is an essential ecosystem service, which may rely on biodiversity for effectiveness and stability. Empirical examples which link functional outcomes of increased biodiversity to pollination services are rare. To investigate the importance of wild and managed pollinator communities to apple production, we assessed the effect of wild and managed bee abundance and diversity on pollen limitation and seed set on commercial farms in New York State. Seed set increased and pollen limitation decreased with increasing wild bee species richness, functional group diversity (based on nesting, sociality, and size traits), and abundance, but not with honey bee abundance. Functional group diversity explained more variation in apple seed set than species richness. Our findings demonstrate the important role of functional complementarity of wild bees, defined here as functional group diversity, to crop pollination even in the presence of large populations of managed honey bees. Therefore, our results suggest that management of diverse pollinator communities may decrease reliance on managed honey bees for pollination services and enhance crop yields. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have led to declines in their populations. In order to design effective conservation measures, it is important to understand the effects of variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging activities of worker bumble bees. This is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the trade-off between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources. We used field surveys, molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20-km(2) agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum. We compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level. Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and 501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 and 272 m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants. Our findings suggest that management of landscape composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging distances across a range of bumble bee species. There is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options, such as agri-environment schemes, aimed at providing foraging habitat for bumble bees and enhancing crop pollination services.

Flower visitation, an important indicator of pollination services, is influenced by plant species richness. However, the spatio-temporal responses of different pollinator groups to plant species richness have not yet been analyzed experimentally. Here, we used an experimental plant species richness gradient to analyze plant-pollinator interactions with an unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. We observed four pollinator functional groups (honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees, and hoverflies) in experimental plots at three different vegetation strata between sunrise and sunset. Visits were modified by plant species richness interacting with time and space. Furthermore, the complementarity of pollinator functional groups in space and time was stronger in species-rich mixtures. We conclude that high plant diversity should ensure stable pollination services, mediated via spatio-temporal niche complementarity in flower visitation.

Insecticides can directly kill these vital insects, whereas herbicides reduce the diversity of their food resources, thus indirectly affecting their survival and reproduction. At sub-lethal level (<LD50), neurotoxic insecticide molecules are known to influence the cognitive abilities of bees, impairing their performance and ultimately impacting on the viability of the colonies. In addition, widespread systemic insecticides appear to have introduced indirect side effects on both honey bees and wild bumblebees, by deeply affecting their health. Immune suppression of the natural defences by neonicotinoid and phenyl-pyrazole (fipronil) insecticides opens the way to parasite infections and viral diseases, fostering their spread among individuals and among bee colonies at higher rates than under conditions of no exposure to such insecticides. This causal link between diseases and/or parasites in bees and neonicotinoids and other pesticides has eluded researchers for years because both factors are concurrent: while the former are the immediate cause of colony collapses and bee declines, the latter are a key factor contributing to the increasing negative impact of parasitic infections observed in bees in recent decades.

Do managed bees drive parasite spread and emergence in wild bees?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE			English	Review							DEFORMED-WING-VIRUS; EMERGING INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; NOSEMA-CERANAE MICROSPORIDIA; HONEYBEES APIS-MELLIFERA; REARED BUMBLE BEES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; VARROA-DESTRUCTOR; PATHOGEN SPILLOVER; EUROPEAN BUMBLEBEE; LOCUSTACARUS-BUCHNERI	Bees have been managed and utilised for honey production for centuries and, more recently, pollination services. Since the mid 20th Century, the use and production of managed bees has intensified with hundreds of thousands of hives being moved across countries and around the globe on an annual basis. However, the introduction of unnaturally high densities of bees to areas could have adverse effects. Importation and deployment of managed honey bee and bumblebees may be responsible for parasite introductions or a change in the dynamics of native parasites that ultimately increases disease prevalence in wild bees. Here we review the domestication and deployment of managed bees and explain the evidence for the role of managed bees in causing adverse effects on the health of wild bees. Correlations with the use of managed bees and decreases in wild bee health from territories across the globe are discussed along with suggestions to mitigate further health reductions in wild bees.

Complementarity has usually been examined in pollinators' patterns of flower visitation or abundance, while largely neglecting the possibility of complementarity in patterns of single-visit contribution to fruit/seed set (pollination efficiency). However, variability in pollination efficiency can greatly affect pollinators' overall pollination services and may therefore contribute an additional, important aspect of complementarity. In this study, we investigated the existence of pollinator complementarity in both visitation rates and pollination efficiencies. The study was conducted in 43 watermelon fields cultivated for seed consumption in a Mediterranean agro-natural landscape in central Israel. We studied spatiotemporal variation in pollinators' visitation activity, measured by repeated observations and netting, and single-visit pollination efficiency, measured by the fruit and seed set rates of hermaphrodite flowers exposed to a single bee visit. Visitation and pollination efficiency were measured throughout the day and season, within and between fields with contrasting availability of nearby wild plants, and among flowers of different sizes. Pollinator species' visitation rates as well as single-visit fruit set efficiencies, but not seed set efficiencies, exhibited significant spatiotemporal variation that contributed to their complementarity. Pollinators' visit frequencies were affected by surrounding land use, location within field, time throughout the season, and time of day. Pollinators' fruit set efficiencies were affected by ovary size and time of day.Synthesis and applications. Crop pollinators may exhibit complementarity in both their visitation rates and pollination efficiencies, which can promote the overall level and stability of their pollination services. Complementarity in pollination efficiencies suggests further diversity effects on crop yield, and calls for taking into account the variability in pollination efficiency along spatiotemporal scales rather than considering it a constant, species-specific trait. However, some modes of niche complementarity may not necessarily translate into increased pollination services and crop yield; the relevance and limitations of such mechanisms should be considered in the light of the specific crop and management system studied.

However, less is known about the difference in foraging traits during visits to wild flowers. We conducted experiments to clarify the foraging behavior of osmia orientalis visiting wild raspberry Rubus hirsutus and compared it with two solitary bees (micrandrena spp. and ceratina flavipes) and two honeybee species (Apis mellifera and A. cerana japonica). The average number of visiting individuals of O. orientalis was greater than that of honeybees. For O. orientalis, the handling time and the number of flowers that an individual visited were no different from those of honeybees. However, more O. orientalis individuals than honeybees collected pollen. The study suggests that the foraging activity of O. orientalis for wild raspberry would be as high as that of honeybees.

Charles; Mizell, Russell F., III			Use of crape myrtle, Lagerstroemia (Myrtales: Lythraceae), cultivars as a pollen source by native and non-native bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in Quincy, Florida	FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article						native pollinator; Apis mellifera; Bombus; Xylocopa; behavior	CRAPEMYRTLE APHID; APOIDEA ANTHOPHILA; CROP POLLINATION; ALACHUA COUNTY; XYLEM FLUID; INDICA; KAHAWALUOKALANI; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY	Crape myrtle, Lagerstroemia species (Myrtales: Lythraceae), has become a dominant flowering plant in the ecosystems of the southeastern USA. Examination of flower records for bees shows few records of pollinators visiting these species even though they produce dimorphic pollen. Sampling of bees from a multi-cultivar crape myrtle planting at the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, North Florida Research & Education Center in Quincy, Florida, via established transect walks in 2009 and 2010, and intensive net collecting in 2011, indicated that bee species from several functional groups (based on taxonomy, body size, and sociality) visited crape myrtle. Results also indicated that crape myrtle cultivars were used differently by the following major bee species (Hymenoptera: Apidae): the honey bee, Apis mellifera L.; the bumble bees Bombus impatiens Cresson and Bombus fraternus (Smith); and the carpenter bees Xylocopa micans Lepeletier and Xylocopa virginica (L.). Numbers of the native bumble bee species varied significantly between years whereas those of honey bees did not. All bee species displayed a marked preference for specific cultivars through time. Bombus impatiens exhibited a very patchy distribution related to the availability of bahiagrass flowering in the understory; these bees used bahiagrass but quickly returned to crape myrtle when bahiagrass was mowed. This suggests that the relationship between this pollinator and the non-native crape myrtle is a weak interaction and a number of unstudied factors may be affecting it. The presence of artificial colonies of B. impatiens resulted in a patchy distribution of these bees nearest the colonies. In contrast, the presence of a honey bee colony near the plot had no effect on honey bee numbers or distribution within the plot. Crape myrtle appears to provide a pollen source for several native bee species as well as for honey bees. Evidence suggests that certain combinations of crape myrtle cultivars could provide additional spatial and temporal support for a diversity of functional groups of pollinators and may augment pollinator species richness. Moreover, as crape myrtle blooms during summer months when other pollen sources are scarce, it has great potential to alleviate stress on pollinators due to food shortages. This work is congruent with previous research demonstrating that crape myrtle supports a large number of beneficial insects, and it further defines the importance of this non-native plant species in impacting several regulating ecosystem services.

Comparing the performance of native and managed pollinators of Haskap (Lonicera caerulea: Caprifoliaceae), an emerging fruit crop	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Bombus; Apis mellifera; Osmia lignaria; Haskap; Pollinators	SELF-POLLINATION; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; APIS-MELLIFERA; OSMIA-CORNUTA; 2 CULTIVARS; BEES; HYMENOPTERA; INTERFERENCE; MEGACHILIDAE; EFFICIENCY	Fruit set in many crops is dependent on pollinating insects, but the pollination performance of floral visitors can vary tremendously among taxa. Apis mellifera L. is the primary managed pollinator used for most crops, but alternative managed bee species or wild pollinators may be more effective and efficient pollinators. In this study, we compared the performance of A. mellifera to commercial Osmia lignaria Say and wild Bombus spp. as pollinators of Haskap (Lonicera caerulea L.), an early flowering fruit crop grown in northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. We conducted field experiments that compared single visit pollen deposition (SVD), foraging behaviour, and pollen load composition among the three taxa. We found that individual Bombus spp. had the highest SVD levels, visited the most flowers per time interval, had high floral constancy, and could tolerate the colder temperatures often experienced during Haskap flowering. Apis mellifera had the lowest SVD levels, spent three times as long per flower as Bombus spp., and were not active during cooler temperatures. However, their potential for high densities in good weather and their affinity for Haskap suggest that as a colony they are important for Haskap pollination. Osmia lignaria rarely visited Haskap when alternative forage such as willow (Salix) was available and therefore contributed very little to Haskap pollination. These results emphasize the economic importance of wild bees in agro-ecosystems, and we conclude that pollination in Haskap orchards can be optimized by providing year-round forage and nesting habitat for wild Bombus spp., in addition to pollination by A. mellifera.

Per-visit pollinator performance and regional importance of wild Bombus and Andrena (Melandrena) compared to the managed honey bee in New York apple orchards	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						native bee; Apis mellifera; reproductive success; crop pollination	FRUIT-SET; SEED SET; APIS-MELLIFERA; NATIVE POLLINATORS; DELICIOUS APPLE; OSMIA-CORNUTA; HYMENOPTERA; POLLEN; MEGACHILIDAE; LANDSCAPES	Declines in honey bee health and increasing demand for pollination services highlight a need to optimize crop pollination by wild bees. Apple is an economically important crop in eastern North America, requires insect pollination, and is visited by a diverse bee fauna, but a direct assessment of wild bee pollination in apple orchards is lacking. We combined measurements of two facets of pollination service, per-visit efficiency (fruit and seed set) and relative abundance, to estimate orchard-level, pollinator importance of mining bees (Andrena subgenus Melandrena), bumble bees (Bombus), and honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Average pollinator importance provided a relative measure that allowed comparison of pollination service among the three focal bees across the study region. On average, a wild bee visit resulted in higher pollen transfer to stigmas, but had the same probability of setting fruit and seed as a honey bee visit. Regionally, pollinator importance of Melandrena and Bombus were 32 and 14 % that of honey bees, respectively. Because per-visit performances were similar, such disparities in importance were based largely on differences in relative abundance. Although the summed pollinator importance of Melandrena and Bombus was less than that of the honey bee, these, and other, wild pollinators have a role to play in filling future pollination gaps, and thus, warrant further study and conservation.

Recent studies showed that diverse wild bee assemblages are more efficient pollinators than honeybees. In urban ecosystems pollination services are also important, for example for the reproduction of many plant species in parks, for the production of vegetables and fruits in home gardens, as well as other animals depending on bee-pollinated plants. 2. This study investigates the effect of 'urbanity' on the abundance, species richness and community structure of wild bees foraging at city trees and quantifies the contribution of wild bees and honeybees to successful pollination. Four common city tree species in Berlin, Germany, were sampled in three parks defined as ` green spaces' and compared with trees in more ` urban areas'. 3. In total, 57 wild bee species foraged at the observed trees representing 19 % of all known species in Berlin. Wild bee species richness showed only small differences between green spaces and urban areas even though social species were found more frequently in green areas. Wild bees visited flowers more frequently in green areas, whereas the numbers of honeybee flower visits were higher in urban areas. Wild bee but not honeybee flower visits showed a positive relationship with the reproductive success of trees. 4. The results suggest that wild bees are important pollinators of city trees that dominate the pollinator community in green spaces. To support wild bee communities green spaces should be preserved and tree species with floral reward should be planted and preserved in urban areas.

During the co-evolution of these two species honey bees have developed several strategies to defend themselves such as learning the odors of hornets and releasing alarm components to inform other mates. However, so far little is known about whether and how honey bees modulate their olfactory learning in the presence of the hornet predator and alarm components of honey bee itself. In the present study, we test for associative olfactory learning of A. cerana in the presence of predator odors, the alarm pheromone component isopentyl acetate (IPA), or a floral odor (hexanal) as a control. The results show that bees can detect live hornet odors, that there is almost no association between the innately aversive hornet odor and the appetitive stimulus sucrose, and that IPA is less well associated with an appetitive stimulus when compared with a floral odor. In order to imitate natural conditions, e.g. when bees are foraging on flowers and a predator shows up, or alarm pheromone is released by a captured mate, we tested combinations of the hornet odor and floral odor, or IPA and floral odor. Both of these combinations led to reduced learning scores. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the prey-predator system between A. cerana and V. velutina.

Worldwide Alien Invasion: A Methodological Approach to Forecast the Potential Spread of a Highly Invasive Pollinator	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS L.; BUMBLE BEE HYMENOPTERA; PSEUDO-ABSENCES; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; INTRODUCED BEES; DISTRIBUTIONS; NICHE; APIDAE; PERFORMANCE	The ecological impacts of alien species invasion are a major threat to global biodiversity. The increasing number of invasion events by alien species and the high cost and difficulty of eradicating invasive species once established require the development of new methods and tools for predicting the most susceptible areas to invasion. Invasive pollinators pose serious threats to biodiversity and human activity due to their close relationship with many plants (including crop species) and high potential competitiveness for resources with native pollinators. Although at an early stage of expansion, the bumblebee species Bombus terrestris is becoming a representative case of pollinator invasion at a global scale, particularly given its high velocity of invasive spread and the increasing number of reports of its impacts on native bees and crops in many countries. We present here a methodological framework of habitat suitability modeling that integrates new approaches for detecting habitats that are susceptible to Bombus terrestris invasion at a global scale. Our approach did not include reported invaded locations in the modeling procedure; instead, those locations were used exclusively to evaluate the accuracy of the models in predicting suitability over regions already invaded. Moreover, a new and more intuitive approach was developed to select the models and evaluate different algorithms based on their performance and predictive convergence. Finally, we present a comprehensive global map of susceptibility to Bombus terrestris invasion that highlights priority areas for monitoring.

J	Gaines-Day, HR; Gratton, C				Gaines-Day, Hannah R.; Gratton, Claudio			Crop yield is correlated with honey bee hive density but not in high-woodland landscapes	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Apis mellifera; Honeybee; Cranberry; Vaccinium macrocarpon; Pollination	WILD BEES; POLLINATORS	Honey bees are the most important managed pollinator worldwide and are vital to the success of modern agriculture. Native, wild bees are also important pollinators in both natural and agricultural systems, and are highly sensitive to habitat in the surrounding landscape. Few studies, however, have considered how managed honey bees, and their effectiveness as crop pollinators, may be influenced by variation in the surrounding landscape. If honey bees are influenced by areas outside of the crop fields in which they are placed, their effectiveness as crop pollinators could be diminished. The goal of this study was to determine whether the relationship between honey bee hive density and crop yield varies with the composition of the surrounding landscape. We collected historical (2000-2011) data on yield and honey bee hive stocking density from 38 commercial cranberry growers in central Wisconsin. Using mixed model regression analyses we found that cranberry yield was strongly, positively correlated with hive density but this effect diminished as the proportion of the surrounding landscape in woodland increased. Thus, at cranberry marshes in low-woodland landscapes (e.g., <42% woodland within 1 km), increasing the density of honey bees increased yields by about1000 kg/hive, while cranberry marshes in high woodland landscapes saw no effect of adding honey bees. These results suggest that honey bees, like wild bees, are influenced by non-crop areas in the surrounding landscape and that landscape context should be considered when making management recommendations for the use of honey bees for crop pollination.

Although its conservation status is unresolved, a petition to list this species as endangered or threatened was recently submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. To shed light on the conservation situation and inform the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decision, we report on the detection and abundance of B. occidentalis following bumble bee collection between 2012 and 2014 across the Pacific Northwest. Collection occurred from the San Juan Islands and Olympic peninsula east to northern Idaho and northeastern Oregon, excluding the arid region in central Washington. B. occidentalis was observed at 23 collection sites out of a total of 234. With the exception of three sites on the Olympic peninsula, all of these were in the southeastern portion of the collection range.

Local Plant Diversity Across Multiple Habitats Supports a Diverse Wild Bee Community in Pennsylvania Apple Orchards	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						floristic diversity; ecosystem service; pollination; apple production; habitat management	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; POLLINATION SERVICES; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; FARMLAND; LANDSCAPES; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; HEDGEROWS; ABUNDANCE	Wild pollinators supply essential, historically undervalued pollination services to crops and other flowering plant communities with great potential to ensure agricultural production against the loss of heavily relied upon managed pollinators. Local plant communities provision wild bees with crucial floral and nesting resources, but the distribution of floristic diversity among habitat types in North American agricultural landscapes and its effect on pollinators are diverse and poorly understood, especially in orchard systems. We documented floristic diversity in typical mid-Atlantic commercial apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) orchards including the forest and orchard-forest edge ("edge") habitats surrounding orchards in a heterogeneous landscape in south-central Pennsylvania, USA. We also assessed the correlation between plant richness and orchard pollinator communities. In this apple production region, edge habitats are the most species rich, supporting 146 out of 202 plant species recorded in our survey. Plant species richness in the orchard and edge habitats were significant predictors of bee species richness and abundance in the orchard, as well as landscape area of the forest and edge habitats. Both the quantity and quality of forest and edges close to orchards play a significant role in provisioning a diverse wild bee community in this agroecosystem.

Agricultural intensification, however, is one of the main drivers resulting in a serious decline of pollinator populations worldwide. 2 In the present study, pollinator communities were examined in 12 apple orchards surrounded by either homogeneous or heterogeneous landscape in Hungary. Pollinators (honey bees, wild bees, hoverflies) were surveyed in the flowering period of apple trees. Landscape heterogeneity was characterized within a radius of 300, 500 and 1000 m around each orchard using Shannon's diversity and Shannon's evenness indices. 3 We found that pollination success of apple was significantly related to the species richness of wild bees, regardless the dominance of honey bees. 4 Diversity of the surrounding landscape matrix had a marginal positive effect on the species richness of hoverflies within a radius of 300 m and a positive effect on the species richness of wild bees within a radius of 500 m, whereas evenness of the surrounding landscape enhanced the abundance of wild bees within a radius of 500 m. Flower resources in the groundcover within the orchards supported honey bees. 5 Therefore, the maintenance of semi-natural habitats within 500 m around apple orchards is highly recommended to enhance wild pollinator communities and apple production.

Shakers and head bangers: differences in sonication behavior between Australian Amegilla murrayensis (blue-banded bees) and North American Bombus impatiens (bumblebees)	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Sonication; Solanum; Vibration; Pollination; Native bees	BUZZ-POLLINATION; PORICIDAL ANTHERS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; POLLEN DISPERSAL; HYMENOPTERA; FLOWERS; APIDAE; REMOVAL; GREENHOUSES; VIBRATION	Many bees collect pollen by grasping the anthers of a flower and vibrating their flight muscles at high frequencies-a behavior termed sonication, or buzz-pollination. Here we compare buzz-pollination on Solanum lycopersicum (cherry tomatoes) by two bees that fill similar niches on different continents-in Australia, Amegilla murrayensis (blue-banded bee), and in North America, Bombus impatiens (bumblebee). We collected audio recordings of buzz-pollination and quantified the frequency and length of buzzes, as well as the total time spent per flower. We found that A. murrayensis buzzes at significantly higher frequencies (similar to 350 Hz) than B. impatiens (similar to 240 Hz) and flaps its wings at higher frequencies during flight. There was no difference in the length of a single buzz, but A. murrayensis spent less time on each flower, as B. impatiens buzzed the flower several times before departing, whereas A. murrayensis typically buzzed the flower only once. High-speed videos of A. murrayensis during buzz-pollination revealed that its physical interaction with the flower differs markedly from the mechanism described for Bombus and other bees previously examined. Rather than grasping the anther cone with its mandibles and shaking, A. murrayensis taps the anther cone with its head at the high buzzing frequencies generated by its flight muscles. This unique behavior, combined with its higher buzzing frequency and reduced flower visit duration, suggests that A. murrayensis may be able to extract pollen more quickly than B. impatiens, and points to the need for further studies directly comparing the pollination effectiveness of these species.

The genetic consequences of the anthropogenic movement of social bees	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Review						Hybridization; Mating interference; Social bees; Invasive species	APIS-MELLIFERA-L.; AFRICANIZED HONEY-BEES; BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; EUROPEAN HONEYBEES; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; STINGLESS BEES; CAPE HONEYBEE; REPRODUCTIVE DISTURBANCE; JAPANESE BUMBLEBEES; POSITIVE SELECTION	Invasive species often play a significant role in ecosystem decline and the loss of biodiversity. Nonetheless, a number of social bee species (Apidae) have been, and are still being, transported outside their native ranges for use as pollinators and honey producers. Many authors have emphasized the ecological consequences of introduced social bees. Less appreciated is that hybridization between local and introduced bees can lead to genomic extinction of indigenous bee taxa and to a loss in overall biodiversity. More directly, mating interference between introduced and native bees may result in reduced reproductive success of the indigenous taxa. It is therefore important that the benefits of introducing exotic bee species be carefully weighed against the possible costs to indigenous populations.	[Byatt, M. A.; Chapman, N. C.; Oldroyd, B.

This study makes a novel comparison of the effectiveness of three wildlife-friendly farming schemes for supporting local habitat diversity and species richness on 12 farms in England. The schemes were: (i) Conservation Grade (Conservation Grade: a prescriptive, non-organic, biodiversity-focused scheme), (ii) organic agriculture and (iii) a baseline of Entry Level Stewardship (Entry Level Stewardship: a flexible widespread government scheme). Conservation Grade farms supported a quarter higher habitat diversity at the 100-m radius scale compared to Entry Level Stewardship farms. Conservation Grade and organic farms both supported a fifth higher habitat diversity at the 250-m radius scale compared to Entry Level Stewardship farms. Habitat diversity at the 100-m and 250-m scales significantly predicted species richness of butterflies and plants. Habitat diversity at the 100-m scale also significantly predicted species richness of birds in winter and solitary bees. There were no significant relationships between habitat diversity and species richness for bumblebees or birds in summer. Butterfly species richness was significantly higher on organic farms (50% higher) and marginally higher on Conservation Grade farms (20% higher), compared with farms in Entry Level Stewardship. Organic farms supported significantly more plant species than Entry Level Stewardship farms (70% higher) but Conservation Grade farms did not (10% higher). There were no significant differences between the three schemes for species richness of bumblebees, solitary bees or birds.Policy implications. The wildlife-friendly farming schemes which included compulsory changes in management, Conservation Grade and organic, were more effective at increasing local habitat diversity and species richness compared with the less prescriptive Entry Level Stewardship scheme. We recommend that wildlife-friendly farming schemes should aim to enhance and maintain high local habitat diversity, through mechanisms such as option packages, where farmers are required to deliver a combination of several habitats.

Exposure of native bees foraging in an agricultural landscape to current-use pesticides	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Native bees; Crop production; Agroecosystems; Pesticides	HYMENOPTERA; NEONICOTINOIDS; ABUNDANCE; INCREASE; HONEY; RISK	The awareness of insects as pollinators and indicators of environmental quality has grown in recent years, partially in response to declines in honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations. While most pesticide research has focused on honey bees, there has been less work on native bee populations. To determine the exposure of native bees to pesticides, bees were collected from an existing research area in northeastern Colorado in both grasslands (20132014) and wheat fields (2014). Traps were deployed bi-monthly during the summer at each land cover type and all bees, regardless of species, were composited as whole samples and analyzed for 136 current-use pesticides and degradates. This reconnaissance approach provides a sampling of all species and represents overall pesticide exposure (internal and external). Nineteen pesticides and degradates were detected in 54 composite samples collected. Compounds detected in >2% of the samples included: insecticides thiamethoxam (46%), bifenthrin (28%), clothianidin (24%), chlorpyrifos (17%), imidacloprid (13%), fipronil desulfinyl (7%; degradate); fungicides azoxystrobin (17%), pyraclostrobin (11%), fluxapyroxad (9%), and propiconazole (9%); herbicides atrazine (19%) andmetolachlor (9%). Concentrations ranged from 1 to 310 ng/g for individual pesticides. Pesticides were detected in samples collected from both grasslands and wheat fields; the location of the sample and the surrounding land cover at the 1000 m radius influenced the pesticides detected but because of a small number of temporally comparable samples, correlations between pesticide concentration and land cover were not significant. The results show native bees collected in an agricultural landscape are exposed to multiple pesticides, these results can direct future research on routes/timing of pesticide exposure and the design of future conservation efforts for pollinators.

Modeling the status, trends, and impacts of wild bee abundance in the United States	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						crop pollination; ecosystem services; habitat suitability; land-use change; uncertainty	NATIVE BEES; POLLINATION SERVICES; CROP POLLINATION; ECONOMIC VALUE; HYMENOPTERA; POPULATIONS; DECLINES; RESTORATIONS; BIODIVERSITY; COMPONENTS	Wild bees are highly valuable pollinators. Along with managed honey bees, they provide a critical ecosystem service by ensuring stable pollination to agriculture and wild plant communities. Increasing concern about the welfare of both wild and managed pollinators, however, has prompted recent calls for national evaluation and action. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we assess the status and trends of wild bees and their potential impacts on pollination services across the coterminous United States. We use a spatial habitat model, national land-cover data, and carefully quantified expert knowledge to estimate wild bee abundance and associated uncertainty. Between 2008 and 2013, modeled bee abundance declined across 23% of US land area. This decline was generally associated with conversion of natural habitats to row crops. We identify 139 counties where low bee abundances correspond to large areas of pollinator-dependent crops. These areas of mismatch between supply (wild bee abundance) and demand (cultivated area) for pollination comprise 39% of the pollinator-dependent crop area in the United States. Further, we find that the crops most highly dependent on pollinators tend to experience more severe mismatches between declining supply and increasing demand. These trends, should they continue, may increase costs for US farmers and may even destabilize crop production over time. National assessments such as this can help focus both scientific and political efforts to understand and sustain wild bees. As new information becomes available, repeated assessments can update findings, revise priorities, and track progress toward sustainable management of our nation's pollinators.

J	Felker, P; Bunch, R				Felker, Peter; Bunch, Ron			The importance of native bees, especially cactus bees (Diadasia spp) in the pollination of cactus pears	JOURNAL OF THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR CACTUS DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Cactus pear; cactus bee; pollination	OPUNTIA; HYMENOPTERA; BIOLOGY	The edible pulp size of cactus pear fruit is highly correlated with seed content, which in turn is correlated with the effectiveness of pollination. In California commercial orchards, honey bees (Apis mellifera) are not nearly as efficient pollinators as the very docile, ground dwelling, solitary, native cactus bee (Diadasia spp). Much additional work on native bees is needed to develop practical methods to: a) establish cactus bees on other plantations, b) manipulate the date of emergence to coincide with late/early flowering, c) develop protocols to safely apply pesticides to control insects such as cochineal without harming native bees, and d) develop other native insect pollinators early in the season (February/early March) when Opuntia flowers are available but no insect pollinators are available.

Bees visiting flowers of Thymus longicaulis (Lamiaceae)	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Apoidea; wild bees; Apis mellifera; thyme; aromatic plants	POLLINATOR SPECIALIZATION; DIVERSITY; WILD	The aim of this study was to investigate the bee fauna foraging on Thymus longicaulis flowers. Samplings were conducted walking along a transect during the T. longicaulis blooming period (April-June). A total of 547 bee specimens, belonging to 40 different species, were recorded during the survey. Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris were the most abundant visitors that foraged on thyme. Pollen grains collected on the bodies of the bees suggest that these pollinators may play an important role in the pollination of this plant.

We monitored bumblebee populations (Bombus spp.) in 14 grassland patches incorporated into the agricultural habitat mosaic in the Mezofold region, Hungary. We asked how bumblebee populations were affected by local vegetation quality and the presence of various landscape elements, including fields in agri-environmental schemes, at various spatial scales. A stratified analysis revealed that vegetation quality, especially the lack of weeds, was the most important local factor that positively affected both bumblebee abundance and species number. We found no significant landscape scale effects between 50-250 m. Between 500-1000 m grassland area in the landscape had consistently significant positive effect on species richness. At the 2 km scale the extent of arable fields had a negative impact on both abundance and richness. A higher percentage area of arable fields in the landscape participating in agri-environmental schemes had no positive effect on bumblebee abundance or species richness. Considering all local and landscape effects and their possible interactions, model selection and variance partitioning revealed that local factors were the most important determinants of bumblebee richness and abundance. Local and landscape factors had high shared variance but did not interact with each other. The present study indicated that small scale landscape composition had the lowest importance, but larger scale landscape composition was significant, most likely because bumblebees can forage far from their nests. If we are able to provide good quality grassland patches incorporated into the agricultural habitat mosaic, then we can build on the strong spill over propensity of bumblebees and can expect their contribution to the pollination of various crops.

Current status of small hive beetle infestation in the Philippines	JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						small hive beetle; Aethina tumida; Asian bees; diversity; Philippines	AETHINA-TUMIDA; NITIDULIDAE; COLEOPTERA	In June 2014, the small hive beetle (SHB), Aethina tumida Murray was first detected in Asia specifically in Lupon, Davao Oriental, Philippines infesting Apis mellifera colonies. It is not known how the beetles were introduced into the country. However, queen shipment from other countries is thought to be the likely route. Between June 2014 and November 2014, several beekeepers had lost all of their A. mellifera colonies (687) from SHB infestations in Davao Oriental. Monitoring of the remaining apiary sites was conducted from 26 November 2014 to 22 December 2015 in Davao (Lupon, Tagum, Panabo) (34 colonies), General Santos (6 colonies), Bukidnon (500 colonies), and Cagayan de Oro (26 colonies). All the apiary sites except Bukidnon and Cagayan de Oro were positive for SHB. Infested colonies were managed using modified beetle blaster traps, physical removal of adult beetles, and apiary and hive hygiene practices. When SHB-free colonies of Apis cerana and stingless bee (Tetragonula biroi) were transferred to SHB-infested apiary, the A. cerana colonies were invaded immediately a day after and absconded after a week. Stingless bee colonies were not at all infested by SHB and remained strong. All the apiary sites in Visayas (312 colonies) and Luzon (989 colonies) were SHB free. Further studies on the biology and host range of SHB in Asia are deemed necessary to contain their spread and preserve the diversity of native bees in the region.

These insects can be affected by many pathogens, including fungi and bacteria, both of which can form spores that are easily dispersed within the colony by means of the stored products, among other routes. The objective of this study was to develop a method to detect spores of the honey bee pathogens Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae, Ascosphaera apis and Paenibacillus larvae in samples of honey, bee pollen and royal jelly. The method was standardized for each product individually, and then analyzed by monoplex and multiplex PCR, which showed the same detection thresholds: 1.25 spores/mL of honey for N. ceranae; 7.5 spores/mL of honey for A. apis; and 0.4 spore/mL of honey for P. larvae, respectively. The standardized technique was effective and rapid for the detection of these pathogens in bee products and can be used for the establishment of official methods of sanitary control of bee products, considering the growing national and international trade of these products and the movement or migration of colonies between regions.

The mitogenome was assembled and found to be 15 266 bp in length and the gene arrangement is similar to other honey bee species. The A. laboriosa mitogenome comprises of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs and an A + T-rich region of 346 bp. Based on the concatenated PCGs, in the phylogenetic tree, A. laboriosa is placed as a sister group along with the cavity nesting honey bees. The present study reports the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence of A. laboriosa, which will enhance our knowledge on Apinae mitogenomes and phylogeny.

TAXONOMIC AND BEHAVIORAL COMPOSITION OF AN ISLAND FAUNA: A SURVEY OF BEES (HYMENOPTERA: APOIDEA: ANTHOPHILA) ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD, MASSACHUSETTS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON			English	Article						native bees; sandplain; Martha's Vineyard; sandplain grassland; pitch pine-scrub oak barrens; invertebrate conservation; pollinator communities; Nomada rodecki	AMERICAN BUMBLE BEES; COASTAL NEW-ENGLAND; NEW-YORK; LANDSCAPE HISTORY; OFFSHORE ISLANDS; OLD FIELD; POLLINATORS; COMMUNITIES; COLEOPTERA; SPECIMENS	An intensive survey of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) on Martha's Vineyard, the largest offshore island in Massachusetts, USA, was conducted mostly from 2010-2011 at over 60 sites across the island's six towns. From over 14,500 specimens collected, processed and databased, we document 182 bee species in 31 genera. Historical records of an additional four species were identified from museum collections. Most bee specimens were collected from trap lines of bee bowls deployed to maximize coverage of habitats, and many others by direct collection targeting known host plants of pollen specialists (oligoleges) and their cleptoparasites. The island's fauna is more species-rich and includes a diverse assemblage of sand-nesting specialists (psammophiles) and pollen specialists with broader botanical associations than the recorded faunas of other regional islands. Notable finds include the first records of Anthophora walshii Cresson from the northeastern USA since the 1970s; two oligoleges of Maleberry Lyonia ligustrina (L.), Colletes productus Robertson and Melitta melittoides (Viereck); the parasitic Nomada rodecki Mitchell, newly associated with M. melittoides and newly placed within the Nomada basalis species group (previously associated with Melitta in Europe); and two species (in addition to N. rodecki) newly recorded from Massachusetts: Andrena neonana Viereck and Nomada xanthura Cockerell. We note 23 species not recorded from other Massachusetts offshore islands, of which 19 were unrecorded from southeastern Massachusetts. Two bumble bee species in the nominate subgenus Bombus, B. affinis Cresson and B. terricola Kirby, that have undergone regional declines were recorded historically from Martha's Vineyard and nearby islands but not found in this survey. Tables and figures are provided to summarize the phenology, taxonomic and behavioral composition of the island's bee fauna, which are discussed with reference to the faunas of Massachusetts, New York, and comparable mainland and island sites. As with other studies employing extensive bee bowl-trapping we found the most numerous species caught to be eusocial halictines. Our results underscore the role of maritime habitats underlain by sandy soils in sustaining regional diversity of bees in addition to Lepidoptera and other well-documented insect groups. Collection of a large proportion of pollen specialists and cleptoparasitic species from one but not both sampling years reinforces the need for multi-year studies of bee faunas.

Piercing of nectarless Hemerocallis (Xanthorrhoeaceae) flowers by Xylocopa varipuncta and X-virginica virginica (Apidae)	JOURNAL OF HYMENOPTERA RESEARCH			English	Article						Apis; Hemerocallis; Xylocopa; cell-fluid consumption; flower-piercing	CARPENTER; BEES	The native carpenter bee Xylocopa varipuncta frequently made and re-used piercings in tubular corolla bases of nonnative, nectarless Hemerocallis 'Stella de Oro' (Stella de Oro Daylily, HSDO) in the Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Plaza in downtown Sacramento, California. The bees frequently visited HSDO flowers from mid-morning through late afternoon in August 2014 during the 3-yr, severe California drought. Their foraging bouts were up to 10 floral visits, and they were evidently obtaining cell fluid. Nonnative Apis mellifera extended their proboscides through the piercings, acting as secondary cell-fluid robbers. They also may have pollinated HSDO when they collected its pollen. Hemerocallis-flower piercing by native X. virginica virginica is apparently rare, but in the Wehawken Nature Preserve in Bethesda, Maryland, a female pierced succulent, nectarless flowers of two other Hemerocallis cultivars and three unnamed seedlings, possibly obtaining cell-fluid, learning that the flowers did not have nectar, or both during the wet summer of 2015.

J	Pinilla-Gallego, MS; Aguilar, ML				Simn Pinilla-Gallego, Mario; Lucia Aguilar, Marlene			Effect of the Breeding Environment on Workers Longevity and Colony Development of Bombus atratus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	ACTA BIOLOGICA COLOMBIANA			Spanish	Article						bumblebees breeding; colony managements; native bees	BUMBLE BEE	Bombus atratus is a native species from South America which has been studied for breeding and management for pollination, and methodologies are currently being developed to use it as a commercial pollinator. For this reason, the aim of the study was to compare the worker's longevity and colony development under different environments: open field (grassland), greenhouse, and brood chamber. Two colonies were used in each environment, all workers were labeled and colonies were checked weekly for the number of workers. Results show that worker's longevity in open field (12 +/- 4 days) and greenhouse (15 +/- 6 days) is significantly less than the worker's longevity in the brood chamber (54 +/- 20 days). Colony development in open field and greenhouse regarding number of workers were similar, with fewer workers than the colonies in the brood chamber. The decrease in worker's longevity in open field and greenhouse may be due to the influence of environmental factors related with the location of the colonies, parasitism or predation, foraging, and the resources availability in the area. The workers high mortality during the first weeks can be a limiting factor for the colonies success. Possible methods to increase the colonies adaptation success are discussed.

We sequenced the non-coding region between the tRNA(Leu) and COII mitochondrial (mt) genes (herein named NC2) of Korean samples, along with the samples from seven Asian localities (China, Vietnam, and Thailand). Four undiscovered haplotypes were found in Korea and China, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Korean A. cerana belonged to the Mainland Asian group. Dominance of Japan1 haplotype in Mainland Asia including Korea suggests extensive gene flow and a common genetic origin. A newly developed non-coding region between the tRNA(Met) and tRNA(Gln)mt genes (named NC1) provided nine haplotypes with twice the number of variable positions compared to those in NC2. A NC1-based phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two phylogenetic groups in Apis cerana from Korea suggesting two different sources.

Proximity to Woodland and Landscape Structure Drives Pollinator Visitation in Apple Orchard Ecosystem	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						apple; bees; heterogeneous landscape; pollination; largest patch index; mean proximity index; ecosystem service	APIDAE FORAGING DISTANCE; WILD BEE POLLINATORS; FRUIT-SET; CROP POLLINATION; ANNAPOLIS VALLEY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NOVA-SCOTIA; HONEY-BEES; HYMENOPTERA; SERVICES	Landscapes of farms and adjacent areas are known to influence abundance of various arthropods such as pollinators in commercial agricultural ecosystems. In this context, we examined the effect of heterogeneous landscapes surrounding and including commercial apple orchards on pollinator visitation and foraging distance during bloom period from 2011 to 2013 in Pennsylvania. Our results showed that the frequency of feral honeybees and solitary bee visits within an apple orchard depends on the proximity of the orchard to an unmanaged habitat (primarily comprised of forest). At the landscape scale, we found that the Mean Proximity Index, the Largest Patch Index, and the Number of Patches positively correlated with the visitation rate of dominant bee taxa (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp., and solitary bees) visiting apple flowers at low spatial scales (up to 500 m around the orchards). The Mean Proximity Index at 500 m was related to bee visitation patterns, especially for solitary bees and A. mellifera. Bees in all our study sites preferred to forage in areas with large homogenous patches up to 500 m around an apple orchard. This effect can be attributed to the mass flowering of apples that formed the largest proportion of the 500 m spatial scale. The Number of Patches at 250 m spatial scale was positively correlated with bee visitation, especially Bombus spp., probably because these areas had more habitats and more resources required by these bees. We conclude that retaining unmanaged habitats closer to commercial apple orchards will maintain biodiversity within the landscapes and insure pollination services to apples.

Major losses of managed honey bee colonies reinforced the need to take advantage of locally adapted subspecies and ecotypes to buffer populations against various stressors. However, introductions of non-native honey bees from distant lineages are likely to undermine respective conservation efforts unless reliable and cost effective tools can be used to identify hybridization. The purpose of this study is to characterize current population structure and genetic diversity, and to assess the degree of admixture between native and introduced honey bees. Moreover, we aim to select a reduced number of genetic markers to improve conservation management strategies. We take advantage of recent developments in next-generation sequencing and network-based clustering to investigate conservation efforts for the native European Dark honey bee, A. m. mellifera, which is threatened by introgression in most of its range. We collected whole-genome sequence information from haploid drones of A. m. mellifera, A. m. carnica, and Buckfast sampled throughout Switzerland (N = 81), as well as from four Swiss A. m. mellifera conservation areas (N = 39) and from one conservatory in the French Alps (N = 31). Population structure analyses based upon 3.375 M genome-wide SNPs discerned samples by subspecies and geographic origin (Switzerland or France). Ancestry inference indicated admixed individuals in all of the protected areas, calling for improved management efforts. After testing different subsets of ancestry informative SNPs using three different selection strategies (F-ST, PCA-based or at random), as few as 50 SNPs are found to be sufficient to differentiate native from introduced honey bees. Therefore, our data suggests that a low-density SNP panel can be a precise and cost-effective tool to support conservation management efforts for managed pollinators.

Scott			Building height matters: nesting activity of bees and wasps on vegetated roofs	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article						urban; biodiversity; green roofs; cavity-nesting; trap nest; Megachile	GREEN ROOFS; LAND-USE; BODY-SIZE; URBAN; HYMENOPTERA; HABITAT; CITY; DIVERSITY; SCALE; INFRASTRUCTURE	Vegetated, green infrastructure, including terraces, balconies, and vegetated roofs and walls are increasingly common in urban landscapes, elevating habitat into novel contexts above ground. Highly mobile species, like bees and wasps, are often seen foraging on green infrastructure, but whether nesting opportunities are facilitated is not known. Cavity-nesting bees and wasps that provision brood in human-made trap nests were monitored over three years on 29 vegetated and non-vegetated roofs in Toronto, Canada. The study identified 27 species nesting on rooftops but found that building height was negatively correlated with the abundance of brood cells provisioned in trap nests, and positively correlated with the number of unfinished nests. A decline in green space area within a 600 m radius around each rooftop resulted in decreasing species richness and abundance. Although the introduced bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) occupied more sites than any other bee or wasp (27.6%) and was the most abundant species, amounting to half (48.9%) of all brood reared, native bees were 73% of all bee species reared. The most abundant wasp was the native spider-collecting Trypoxylon collinum Smith (11.4%), but the introduced aphid-collecting Psenulus pallipes (Panzer) occurred at more sites (24.1%). For the pollination and pest controlling services they provide, bees and wasps should be considered in the design of vegetated roofs. Evidence here suggests that building height and surrounding green space at ground level impact bee and wasp diversity on vegetated roofs.

IMPORTANCE OF POLLINATING INSECTS FOR MAINTAINING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN EASTERN CROATIA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						pollinators; insects; habitat; agriculture; Croatia	COLONY LOSSES; BEE DIVERSITY; HABITATS; PROTECTION; EFFICIENCY; STABILITY; DECREASE; DECLINE; CROPS	Significant efforts are currently undertaken in Europe for estimating the size and stability of insect populations, especially the useful pollinators. In Croatia, there is a lack of researches on size and stability of the population of pollinators not managed by the man. Insect pollination benefits to plant reproduction within natural and agro-ecosystems, and contributes to conservation of wild flora, as well as crop production. Furthermore, wild pollinators are known as indicators of the environmental stability. Importance of honey bee is high in the intensive agricultural areas, where wild pollinators are suppressed due to shortage of food sources and nesting spaces. In the research, we used pan-traps to estimate pollinator diversity in three different habitats in eastern Croatia: Nature Park 'Kopacki Rit' as natural and undisturbed habitat, countryside near the Park as semi-natural habitat, and agricultural habitat under intensive crop production. In July 2015, different colour pan traps were exposed at each habitat during one-day period for capturing pollinating insects. Highest richness, diversity and evenness values are recorded at semi-natural habitat, while lowest values are recorded in agricultural habitat. For maintaining sustainable agriculture it is recommended to conserve some natural habitats for wild pollinators in the intensive agricultural areas.

The objective of this study was to determine the physicochemical characteristics, the concentration of phenol compounds and the antioxidant capacity of propolis of native stingless bees (Meliponinae) and Apis from the State of Tocantins. Extraction with 80% ethanol (v/v) was performed in order to obtain the extracts. Parameters examined were: propolis mass loss by desiccation at 105 degrees C, ashes, wax concentration and pH. Furthermore, the propolis antioxidant activity was measured, as well as the total concentration of phenol compounds. The extracts were also analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The total concentration of phenol compounds varied between 121.78 and 631.29 (mg GAE g(-1)). The antioxidant activity expressed by the value of CE50 varied between 29.81 and 845.38 mu g mL(-1). High performance liquid chromatography analysis allowed us to infer the existence of phenol compounds. The results indicated that the studied propolis samples constitute good sources of natural antioxidants. The variety of phenol compounds identified in this study, and the diverse biological functions reported in literature for these compounds indicated that this stingless bee propolis (Meliponinae) and Apis has a high pharmacological potential.

J	Schlueter, MA; Stewart, NG				Schlueter, Mark A.; Stewart, Nicholas G.			Native Bee (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) Abundance and Diversity in North Georgia Apple Orchards throughout the 2010 Growing Season (March to October)	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							LASIOGLOSSUM DIALICTUS; POLLINATORS; HONEY; HALICTIDAE; REVISION	Bees play a key role in agriculture, directly affecting the production of over one-third of the human food supply. Apis mellifera (Honey Bee), the chief pollinator used in commercial agriculture, has been in decline. Reliance on a single species for the pollination of a significant portion of commercial agriculture can be dangerous. One alternative to using Honey Bees as the main commercial pollinator is native bees. In this study, we document native bee species diversity and abundance throughout the 2010 growing season (March through October) at 4 North Georgia Malus domestica (Apple) orchards. The 4 study sites included 2 large-scale orchards (Mercier Orchards and Hillside Orchards) and 2 smallscale orchards (Mountain View Orchards and Tiger Mountain Orchards). A comprehensive sampling methodology using pan-traps, vane-traps, malaise traps, and sweep-netting was performed at each orchard on 8 separate collection days. A total of 1817 bees were identified to species. These bees comprised 128 species in 28 genera in 5 families. Several native bee species were quite common and widespread at all 4 orchards. These native bee species included: Andrena crataegi, A. perplexa, Lasioglossum imitatum, L. pilosum, and Xylocopa virginica (Eastern Carpenter Bee). Andrena crataegi was identified as the best native bee candidate for Apple pollination in North Georgia due to its abundance, wide-spread distribution in Georgia Apple orchards, and its life-history characteristics.

Properly arranged ornamental gardens in both urban and agricultural landscapes can be of a benefit to bees. In this study, we observed the flowering phenology, nectar, and pollen production of the ornamental Hosta species and varieties (H. sieboldiana Engler, H. capitata Nakai, H. crispula Maekawa, H. fluctuans Maekawa, syn. H. sieboldiana var. fluctuans hort., H. undulata var. univittata Miquel (Hylander), syn. H. univittata). Our experiment was conducted in the 2012 - 2014 time period, at the UMCS Botanical Garden in Lublin, Poland (51 degrees 14' N, 21 degrees 34' E). The total sugar yield varied almost 5-fold among Hosta ornamentals; the lowest amount was calculated for H. fluctuans (2.31 g per 10 m(2)) and the highest for H. capitata (11.80 g per 10 m(2)). The average pollen yield was from 0.24 g per 10 m(2) (H. undulata var. univittata) to 9.53 g per 10 m(2) (H. capitata). Pollen grains were bilaterally symmetrical, and large-sized. In polar view, they were prolatum (shape index 1.33 - 1.61), while in equatorial view, oblatum (shape index 0.5 - 0.7). Hosta species can complete the summer pasture mainly for bumblebees. In four of the five Hosta representatives, bumblebees accounted for 60 - 70% of the total visits. The honeybee predominated only on the flowers of H. capitata (54 - 71%). Solitary bees were rarely observed (3 - 9% of visits). The phenotypic traits of Hosta flowers (the accumulation of nectar in the deep and narrow perianth tube) reduced the access to nectar reward and restricted an array of insect visitors.

Fruit set in perennial vetch (Vicia unijuga): reproductive system and insect role in pollination	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						alpine habitats; breeding system; pod set; pollination activity; Vicia unijuga; wild bumble bees	POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; SEED ABORTION; HONEYBEES; POPULATION; DIVERSITY; BEHAVIOR	Perennial vetch (Vicia unijuga) is a wild plant found in parts of East Asia and potentially valuable as a forage species for more extreme environments. Information on its reproductive system and pollination biology is needed for progress in domestication of the species. We characterized the reproductive system of perennial vetch as facultative xenogamy (i.e. it is largely cross-pollinated by insects but is also self-compatible and can selfpollinate). There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the fruit set ratio between insect cross-pollination and artificial cross-pollination at the seed maturation stage, but natural self-pollination was inefficient. In our study conducted on the Tibetan plateau, eight insect species (especially certain bumble bees) are identified as potential pollinators, and four other insect species belonging to the Lepidoptera and Diptera visited flowers but are unlikely to be pollinators. The flower visitation rate of wild bumble bees was 1.6-3.3 times higher than domestic honeybees, with Bombus lepidus having the highest visitation rate of 15.7 florets/min. The diurnal floret opening rhythm of perennial vetch was synchronized with diurnal activity of potential pollinators. Optimal pollination of perennial vetch would likely be achieved using wild bees, as they have behaviour characteristics and flower tripping ability necessary, and are present in sufficient numbers to be efficient pollinators of this crop. However, even with sufficiency of pollination, there remains a fundamental problem with low fruit set which requires further investigation from a plant biology perspective.

Phenotypic Variation in Fitness Traits of a Managed Solitary Bee, Osmia ribifloris (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						mtDNA; conservation; usurpation; captivity; pollination	INBREEDING DEPRESSION; ROTUNDATA HYMENOPTERA; ECOLOGICAL GENETICS; NESTING SUCCESS; LEAFCUTTER BEE; MASON BEE; BODY-SIZE; SEX-RATIO; LIGNARIA; CONSERVATION	We investigated fitness in natural populations of a managed solitary bee Osmia ribifloris Cockerell (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) from sites separated from 400 to 2,700 km. Parental wild bees originated in central Texas (TX), central-northern Utah (UT), and central California (CA). They were then intercrossed and raised inside a mesh enclosure in southern Mississippi (MS). Females from all possible mated pairs of O. ribifloris produced F-1 broods with 30-40% female cocoons and outcrossed progeny were 30% heavier. Mitochondrial (COI) genomes of the four populations revealed three distinct clades, a TX-CA clade, a UT clade, and an MS clade, the latter (MS) representing captive progeny of CA and UT bees. Although classified as separate subspecies, TX and CA populations from 30A degrees N to 38A degrees N latitude shared 98% similarity in COI genomes and the greatest brood biomass per nest straw (600- to 700-mg brood). Thus, TX and CA bees show greater adaptation for southern U.S. sites. In contrast, UT-sourced bees were more distantly related to TX and CA bees and also produced similar to 50% fewer brood. These results, taken together, confirm that adult O. ribifloris from all trap-nest sites are genetically compatible, but some phenotypic variation exists that could affect this species performance as a commercial blueberry pollinator. Males, their sperm, or perhaps a substance in their sperm helped stabilize our captive bee population by promoting legitimate nesting over nest usurpation. Otherwise, without insemination, 50% fewer females nested (they nested 14 d late) and 20% usurped nests, killing 33-67% of brood in affected nests.	[Sampson, B. J.; Rinehart, T. A.; Stringer, S.

Within-Colony Variation in the Immunocompetency of Managed and Feral Honey Bees (Apis mellifera L.) in Different Urban Landscapes	INSECTS			English	Article						urbanization; pollinator populations; honey bees; encapsulation response; phenoloxidase	IMMUNE FUNCTION; DISEASE RESISTANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY; TEMPERATURE; POPULATION; HEMOLYMPH; ONTOGENY; DEFENSE; STRESS	Urbanization has the potential to dramatically affect insect populations worldwide, although its effects on pollinator populations are just beginning to be understood. We compared the immunocompetency of honey bees sampled from feral (wild-living) and managed (beekeeper-owned) honey bee colonies. We sampled foragers from feral and managed colonies in rural, suburban, and urban landscapes in and around Raleigh, NC, USA. We then analyzed adult workers using two standard bioassays for insect immune function (encapsulation response and phenoloxidase activity). We found that there was far more variation within colonies for encapsulation response or phenoloxidase activity than among rural to urban landscapes, and we did not observe any significant difference in immune response between feral and managed bees. These findings suggest that social pollinators, like honey bees, may be sufficiently robust or variable in their immune responses to obscure any subtle effects of urbanization. Additional studies of immune physiology and disease ecology of social and solitary bees in urban, suburban, and natural ecosystems will provide insights into the relative effects of changing urban environments on several important factors that influence pollinator productivity and health.

Network of Bee-plant Interactions and Recognition of Key Species in Semideciduous Forest	SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Inventory; bees; fragment; nestedness	BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; NESTEDNESS; CENTRALITY	Bees are the most effective pollinators of native plants, contributing to the maintenance of many ecosystems, including forests. Studies about networks of bee-plant interactions are critical for conservation and habitat management of native pollinators. This study aimed to determine the richness of flower-visiting bees in a fragment of the Semideciduous Forest (SF) in Uberlndia-MG, identify the plants visited by them and build the bee-plant interactions network in this fragment. The study was conducted between October 2010 and September 2011 along a transect of 200 meters on the edge of the forest, with monthly collections performed from 8: 00 am to 2: 30 pm. We yielded the bee-plant interaction networks and calculated the NODF index and betweenness centrality. We collected 70 bee species and 25 plant species. The network of interactions was nested (NODF = 10.97, P = 0.03). Apis mellifera Linnaeus and Merremia macrocalyx (Ruiz & Pav.) O'Donell showed the highest centrality. The nestedness of the bee-plant interaction confers stability to the network, demonstrating its importance for the fragment conservation. It is likely that M. macrocalyx is a key species in this network since this plant attracted the highest number of bee species and showed the highest centrality, contributing to network cohesion.

Recent concerns about the declines of both domestic and wild bees, calls for measures to promote wild pollinator populations in farmland. However, to be able to efficiently promote and prioritize between measures that benefit pollinators, such as modified land use, agri-environment schemes, or specific conservation measures, it is important to have a tool that accurately predicts how bees use landscapes and respond to such measures. In this paper we compare an existing model for predicting pollination (the "Lonsdorf model"), with an extension of a general model for habitat use of central place foragers (the "CPF model"). The Lonsdorf model has been shown to perform relatively well in simple landscapes, but not in complex landscapes. We hypothesized that this was because it lacks a behavioral component, assuming instead that bees in essence diffuse out from the nest into the landscape. By adding a behavioral component, the CPF model in contrast assumes that bees only use those parts of the landscape that enhances their fitness, completely avoiding foraging in other parts of the landscape. Because foraging is directed toward the most rewarding foraging habitat patches as determined by quality and distance, foraging habitat will include a wide range of forage qualities close to the nest, but a much narrower range farther away. We generate predictions for both simple and complex hypothetical landscapes, to illustrate the effect of including the behavioral rule, and for real landscapes. In the real landscapes the models give similar predictions for visitation rates in simple landscapes, but more different predictions in heterogeneous landscapes. We also analyze the consequences of introducing hedgerows near a mass-flowering crop field under each model. The Lonsdorf model predicts that any habitat improvement will enhance pollination of the crop. In contrast, the CPF model predicts that the hedgerow must provide good nesting sites, and not just foraging opportunities, for it to benefit pollination of the crop, because good forage quality alone may drain bees away from the field. Our model can be used to optimize pollinator mitigation measures in real landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition, specific queen-characteristic hydrocarbons have been implicated as sterility-inducing queen signals in ants, wasps and bumblebees. In Corbiculate bees, however, the chemical nature of queen-characteristic and fertility-linked compounds appears to be more diverse than in ants and wasps. Moreover, it remains unknown how queen signals evolved across this group and how they might have been co-opted from fertility signals in solitary ancestors. Results: Here, we perform a phylogenetic analysis of fertility-linked compounds across 16 species of solitary and eusocial bee species, comprising both literature data as well as new primary data from a key solitary outgroup species, the oil-collecting bee Centris analis, and the highly eusocial stingless bee Scaptotrigona depilis. Our results demonstrate the presence of fertility-linked compounds belonging to 12 different chemical classes. In addition, we find that some classes of compounds (linear and branched alkanes, alkenes, esters and fatty acids) were already present as fertility-linked signals in the solitary ancestors of Corbiculate bees, while others appear to be specific to certain species. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that queen signals in Corbiculate bees are likely derived from ancestral fertility-linked compounds present in solitary bees that lacked reproductive castes. These original fertility-linked cues or signals could have been produced either as a by-product of ovarian activation or could have served other communicative purposes, such as in mate recognition or the regulation of egg-laying.

The function of the variation of the patterns remains unresolved, with suggestions that these enhance pollinator communication. We investigated the possible function of the labellum pattern in Ophrys heldreichii, an orchid species in which the conspicuous and complex labellum pattern contrasts with a dark background. The orchid is pollinated exclusively by males of the solitary bee, Eucera berlandi. Comparisons of labellum patterns revealed that patterns within inflorescences are more similar than those of other conspecific plants. Field observations showed that the males approach at a great speed and directly land on flowers, but after an unsuccessful copulation attempt, bees hover close and visually scan the labellum pattern for up to a minute. Learning experiments conducted with honeybees as an accessible model of bee vision demonstrated that labellum patterns of different plants can be reliably learnt; in contrast, patterns of flowers from the same inflorescence could not be discriminated. These results support the hypothesis that variable labellum patterns in O. heldreichii are involved in flower-pollinator communication which would likely help these plants to avoid geitonogamy.

Use of video surveillance to measure the influences of habitat management and landscape composition on pollinator visitation and pollen deposition in pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) agroecosystems	PEERJ			English	Article						Pollination services; Landscape; Pumpkin; Peponapis pruinosa; Bumble bee; Apis mellifera; Habitat managment; Floral strips	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; WILD BEE ABUNDANCE; HONEY-BEE; NATIVE BEES; CROP POLLINATION; APIS-MELLIFERA; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PEPONAPIS-PRUINOSA; WILDFLOWER STRIPS; NATURAL ENEMIES	Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) production relies on insect-mediated pollination, which is provided by managed and wild pollinators. The goals of this study were to measure the visitation frequency, longevity and temporal activity patterns of pumpkin pollinators and to determine if local habitat management and landscape composition affected this pollination service. We used video surveillance to monitor bee acitivty within male and female pumpkin flowers in 2011 and 2012 across a pollination window of 0600-1200 h. We also quantified the amount of pollen deposited in female flowers across this time period. In 2011, A. mellifera made significantly more floral visits than other bees, and in 2012 Bombus spp. was the dominant pumpkin pollinator. We found variation in visitation among male and female pumpkin flowers, with A. mellifera visiting female flowers more often and spending longer per visit within them than male flowers in both 2011 and 2012. The squash bee P. pruinosa visited male flowers more frequently in 2012, but individuals spent equal time in both flower sexes. We did not find variation in the timing of flower visitation among species across the observed pollination window. In both 2011 and 2012 we found that the majority of pollen deposition occurred within the first two hours (0600-0800 h) of observation; there was no difference between the pollen deposited during this two-hour period and full pollination window (0600-1200 h). Local additions of sweet alyssum floral strips or a field buffer strip of native wildflowers did not have an effect on the foraging activity of bees or pollen deposition. However, semi-natural and urban habitats in the surrounding landscape were positively correlated with the frequency of flower visitation by wild pollinators and the amount of pollen deposited within female flowers.

Mitigation of pollen limitation in the lowbush blueberry agroecosystem: effect of augmenting natural pollinators	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						fruit yield; inbreeding depression; non-native pollinators; pollen limitation; resource limitation; self-pollination	VACCINIUM-ANGUSTIFOLIUM; PLANT REPRODUCTION; FRUIT-SET; FLOWERING PLANTS; BEES HYMENOPTERA; SEED PRODUCTION; MALE FITNESS; ERICACEAE; PATTERNS; YIELD	Growers of small fruit crops often supplement the natural pollinator community by introducing pollinators into commercial orchards and fields, but there are relatively few studies that test the extent to which such interventions increase fruit yield. To test whether plants are limited by pollen availability, inflorescences in 78 commercial lowbush blueberry fields during three years were hand-pollinated either with supplemental outcross pollen, or marked and left as controls (open-pollination). Maximum fruit set with supplemental pollination was in the range 50-65%, whereas with open-pollination, it was slightly, but significantly lower, in the range of 47-57%, suggesting that pollen limitation can affect fruit set. In a two-year experiment, we augmented native pollinators with introduced honey bees, bumble bees, and leaf cutter bees and all combinations in 48 fields. Stigmatic pollen loads were influenced by the total numbers of managed bees in a field in 2010 but not 2011. The presence of leaf cutter bees had a small but positive effect on seed set in 2010, and honey bees had a small but negative influence on seed set in 2011. There was a strong correlation between fruit set reproductive output of supplementally pollinated and open-pollinated plants, suggesting that plant health or plant resources influence reproductive success. Temperature variation among regional groupings of fields was minimal and is unlikely to have accounted for differences among fields in fruit set. We propose several reasons why, despite pollen-limitation of fruit and seed set of blueberry plants, augmentation of the pollinator community of lowbush blueberry did not significantly increase reproduction. These include pollinator-mediated transfer of self-pollen followed by subsequent fruit abortion due to inbreeding depression and resource limitation for fruit maturation. Management practices that focus on increasing outcross pollen receipt, or plant resources for fruit set may have greater overall benefit than pollinator augmentation alone.

As in many wild bees, their abundance and diversity have declined in recent years, which may threaten the stability of pollination services. The observed decline is often linked with the loss or alteration of natural habitat, e.g., through urbanization, the conversion of natural habitat into largely sealed areas (concrete) inhabited by humans. The effects of urbanization on bumble bees remain as yet controversial with both positive and negative effects reported. We investigated how habitat isolation through increasing areas of concrete, as well as the diversity, abundance, and community composition of floral resources, determine bumble bee abundance and diversity in cities. We found plant species diversity and abundance to be more important than the amount of concrete in driving the abundance and species richness of common bumble bees in a German city. Moreover, plant species composition, i.e., the presence of specific plant species and families (e.g., Fabaceae), played a prominent role. In particular, flower-rich parks and gardens can offer a continuous food supply for bumble bees and attract bumble bee foragers even to isolated patches in the city center.

J	Giovanetti, M; Lippi, MM; Foggi, B; Giuliani, C				Giovanetti, Manuela; Lippi, Marta Mariotti; Foggi, Bruno; Giuliani, Claudia			Exploitation of the invasive Acacia pycnantha pollen and nectar resources by the native bee Apis mellifera	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Alien acacia; Extrafloral nectaries; Honey bee foraging behaviour; Dehiscence timing; Nectar secretion timing	POLLINATOR VISITATION; EXTRAFLORAL NECTARIES; NONNATIVE FLORA; PLANT INVASIONS; DEFENSE; SUCCESS	The importance of broad ecological perspectives has been well recognised with regard to the spread of alien species. However, less attention has been paid to single plant-animal relationships such as the mechanism through which interactions with pollinators take place, which is responsible for the evolution of new mutualistic relationships and the outcome of sexual reproduction and distribution of plants. Because the majority of plant-pollinator relationships are based on food collection by pollinators, we investigated the extent of exploitation of Acacia pycnantha by Apis mellifera. A. pycnantha is native to Australia, but is invasive in many Mediterranean countries, including Italy. We investigated whether visits by the native pollinator A. mellifera to a non-native food source (A. pycnantha) were occasional, or dictated by a precise pattern matching resource availability. Showing that a native pollinator's foraging strategy has readily adapted to a potential resource offered by an invasive plant allows us to understand better the mechanisms promoting invasiveness of alien angiosperms. We collected data on pollen and nectar characteristics and variation in their availability, and conducted behavioural observations of foraging honey bees. Acacia pycnantha flower heads and extrafloral nectaries are sources of food actively selected by honey bees, which display behaviours strongly associated with resource availability. Our results showed clear evidence of a strong invasive plant-native pollinator relationship, enhancing the success of sexual reproduction of the alien species. Future studies may highlight to which extent this relationship has influenced the spread of this invasive plant.

Honey bees are extensively relied upon for pollination services, and in countries such as New Zealand and Australia where honey bees have been introduced specifically for commercial pollinator services, the economic effects of any decline in honey bee numbers are predicted to be profound. V. destructor established in New Zealand in 2000 but as yet, Australia remains Varroa-free. Here we analyze the history of V. destructor invasion and spread in New Zealand and discuss the likely long-term impacts. When the mite was discovered in New Zealand, it was considered too well established for eradication to be feasible. Despite control efforts, V. destructor has since spread throughout the country. Today, assessing the impacts of the arrival of V. destructor in this country is compromised by a paucity of data on pollinator communities as they existed prior to invasion. Australia's Varroa-free status provides a rare and likely brief window of opportunity for the global bee research community to gain understanding of honey bee-native pollinator community dynamics prior to Varroa invasion.

Mitigating the anthropogenic spread of bee parasites to protect wild pollinators	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Review						Apis mellifera; Bombus impatiens; Bombus terrestris; Commercial bumble bees; Disease screening; Emerging diseases; Pollination	BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS HYMENOPTERA; REARED BUMBLE BEES; SMALL HIVE BEETLE; HONEY-BEE; NOSEMA-CERANAE; APIS-MELLIFERA; LOCUSTACARUS-BUCHNERI; WORLDWIDE MIGRATION; PATHOGEN SPILLOVER; NATIVE BUMBLEBEES	Bees naturally suffer from a broad range of parasites, including mites, protozoans, bacteria, fungi and viruses. Some appear to be host-specific, but most appear able to infect multiple bee species, and some are found in insects outside of the Hymenoptera. The host range, natural geographic range and virulence in different hosts are poorly understood for most bee parasites. It is of considerable concern that the anthropogenic movement of bees species for crop pollination purposes has led to the accidental introduction of bee parasites to countries and continents where they do not naturally occur, exposing native bees to parasites against which they may have little resistance. In at least one instance, that of the South American bumble bee Bombus dahlbomii, this has led to a catastrophic population collapse. The main bees that are moved by man are the western honeybee, Apis mellifera, and two species of bumble bee, the European Bombus terrestris and the North American Bombus impatiens. We propose a range of mitigation strategies that could greatly reduce the risk of further impacts of the commercial bee trade on global,bee health, including stricter controls on international movement of bees and improved hygiene and parasite screening of colonies before and after shipping.

Studies show negative correlations between flower visitation of honey bees (Apis mellifera) and wild bees, but effects on the reproduction of wild bees were not proven. Likely reasons are that honey bees can hardly be excluded from controls and wild bee nests are generally difficult to detect in field experiments. The goal of this study was to investigate whether red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) compete with honey bees in cages in order to compare the reproduction of red mason bees under different honey bee densities. Three treatments were applied, each replicated in four cages of 18m(3) with 38 red mason bees in all treatments and 0, 100, and 300 honey bees per treatment with 10-20% being foragers. Within the cages, the flower visitation and interspecific displacements from flowers were observed. Niche breadths and resource overlaps of both bee species were calculated, and the reproduction of red mason bees was measured. Red mason bees visited fewer flowers when honey bees were present. Niche breadth of red mason bees decreased with increasing honey bee density while resource overlaps remained constant. The reproduction of red mason bees decreased in cages with honey bees. In conclusion, our experimental results show that in small and isolated flower patches, wild bees can temporarily suffer from competition with honey bees. Further research should aim to test for competition on small and isolated flower patches in real landscapes.

Chemical Variability of Geopropolis from Jatai, Mandacaia and Manduri Stingless Bees	REVISTA VIRTUAL DE QUIMICA			Portuguese	Article						Geopropolis; meliponinae; meliponiculture; chemical variability; chemometrics; quality control		Stingless bees (meliponinae) are popularly known as native bees and are important pollinators of many crops. Honey from these insects has a palatable flavor and is sold at higher values than Apis mellifera honey. In addition, beehives from stingless bees are marketed with ornamental and environmental purposes. Despite the economic growth of meliponiculture, studies with meliponinae beehive products are scarce. Stingless bees produce geopropolis which consists of plant resins mixed with soil or clay. In the current study the chemical, qualitative and quantitative composition and the antiradical activity of geopropolis produced by different Meliponinae species occurring in Prudentopolis, Parana were compared. Antiradical activity, as well as total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined. Spectral profiles by UV-Vis Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry with Electrospray Ionization (ESI-MS) were compared as well. The effect of the native bee species (Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille), Melipona quadrifasciata quadrifasciata (Lepeletier) e Melipona marginata (Lepeletier)) and the harvest period on the chemical variability of geopropolis was assessed by statistical tools such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis (Principal Component Analysis, PCA). It was observed that both investigated effects, bee species and harvest period, significantly affected the levels of total phenolics and flavonoids and the antiradical activity. Additionally, 12 components of geopropolis were identified by UPLCMS/MS. PCA grouped geopropolis as function of the bee species, indicating that, for the same geographic region, the overall chemical composition of geopropolis is mainly determined by the stingless bee species.

Ascosphaera apis, the entomopathogenic fungus affecting larvae of native bees (Xylocopa augusti): First report in South America	REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE MICOLOGIA			English	Article						Large carpenter bee; South America; Ascosphaera apis; Entomopathogenic fungus	CHALKBROOD; HYMENOPTERA; PATHOGENS; HONEYBEE	Background: Nowadays several invertebrate pollinators of crops and wild plants are in decline as result of multiple and, sometimes, unknown factors; among them, the modern agricultural practices, pests and diseases are postulated as the most important factors. Bees of the genus Xylocopa are considered effective pollinators of passion fruit crops in tropical regions, as well as important pollinators in wild plants, but these bees are attacked by several pathogens that affect different stages in their life cycle. The fungal species of the genus Ascosphaera are commonly associated with social and solitary bee larvae causing chalkbrood disease. Aims: The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the presence of Ascosphaera apis affecting larvae of Xylocopa augusti in South America. Methods: For this purpose, A. apis was isolated from affected larvae in YGPSA medium. Final identification was run out by three techniques: (1) Microscopic examination of the hyphae and sizes of the fruiting bodies; (2) Mating test, and specific sexual compatibility test, and (3) PCR detection, using specific primers. Results: This study demonstrates for the first time the presence of A. apis affecting larvae of X. augusti in South America. Conclusions: The evidence of A. apis affecting the larvae of X augusti, and the fact that the sharing of pathogens between different bee species has been underestimated, suggests the need for further epidemiological studies in order to determine not only the prevalence of this pathogen among wild pollinators, but also its relationship to the sudden collapse of honey bee colonies in this region.

Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result in actual population-level effects.

Effects of landscape composition and configuration on pollination in a native herb: a field experiment	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Pollen limitation; Source habitats; Landscape heterogeneity; Seed set; Sexual reproduction	MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; POLLEN LIMITATION; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; PLANT REPRODUCTION; VISCARIA-VULGARIS; DIVERSITY; SERVICES; SCALE; POPULATIONS; PERSISTENCE	Bumble bee abundance in agricultural landscapes is known to decrease with increasing distance from seminatural grasslands, but whether the pollination of bumble-bee-pollinated wild plants shows a similar pattern is less well known. In addition, the relative effects of landscape composition (landscape heterogeneity) and landscape configuration (distance from seminatural grassland) on wild plant pollination, and the interaction between these landscape effects, have not been studied using landscape-level replication. We performed a field experiment to disentangle these landscape effects on the pollination of a native herb, the sticky catchfly (Lychnis viscaria), while accounting for the proportion of oilseed rape across landscapes and the local abundance of bee forage flowers. We measured pollen limitation (the degree to which seed set is pollen-limited), seed set, and seed set stability using potted plants placed in landscapes that differed in heterogeneity (composition) and distance from seminatural grassland (configuration). Pollen limitation and seed set in individual plants did not respond to landscape composition, landscape configuration, or proportion of oilseed rape. Instead, seed set increased with increasing local bee forage flower cover. However, we found within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to increase with increasing distance from seminatural pasture. Our results suggest that average within-plant levels of pollen limitation and seed set respond less swiftly than the within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to changes in landscape configuration. Although landscape effects on pollination were less important than predicted, we conclude that landscape configuration and local habitat characteristics play larger roles than landscape composition in the pollination of L. viscaria.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity; Bombus; bumblebees; floral resources; garden flowers; honeybee; hoverflies; plant choice; pollinators; solitary bees	FARM-SCALE EVALUATIONS; URBAN; RICHNESS; RESOURCE; BUMBLEBEES; EXTENT; FLORA; BEES	Domestic gardens typically consist of a mixture of native and non-native plants which support biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services, particularly in urban environments. Many gardeners wish to encourage biodiversity by choosing appropriate plant taxa. The value of native and non-native plants in supporting animal biodiversity is, however, largely unknown. The relative value of native and non-native garden plants to invertebrates was investigated in a replicated field experiment. Plots (deliberately akin to garden borders) were planted with one of three treatments, representing assemblages of plants based on origin (native, near-native and exotic). Invertebrates and resource measurements were recorded over fouryears. This paper reports the abundance of flower-visiting aerial insects (pollinators') associated with the three plant assemblages. For all pollinator groups on all treatments, greater floral resource resulted in an increase in visits. There was, however, a greater abundance of total pollinators recorded on native and near-native treatments compared with the exotic plots. Short-tongued bumblebees followed the same pattern whilst more hoverflies were recorded on the native treatment than the other treatments, and more honeybees on the near-native treatment. There was no difference between treatments in abundance of long-tongued bumblebees or solitary bees. The lack of difference in solitary bee abundance between treatments was probably due to a third of individuals from this group being recorded on one exotic plant species. The number of flower visitors corresponded to the peak flowering period of the treatments, that is there were fewer flower visitors to the exotic treatment compared with the other treatments in early summer but relatively more later in the season.Synthesis and applications. This experiment has demonstrated that utilizing plants from only a single region of origin (i.e. nativeness) may not be an optimal strategy for resource provision for pollinating insects in gardens. Gardens can be enhanced as a habitat by planting a variety of flowering plants, biased towards native and near-native species but with a selection of exotics to extend the flowering season and potentially provide resources for specialist groups.

Heathlands, protected open habitats under EU law, provide floral resources (pollen and nectar) for a range of pollinating insects. In early spring, in Belgian heathlands, only two floral resources are available: willows Salix spp. (Salicaceae) and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus (Ericaceae). Our objective was to assess whether these two plant species provide quantitative and qualitative resources during early spring. We examined the springtime activity of flower visitors on both S. x multinervis and V. myrtillus flowers in relation to sugar concentration and composition in nectar as well as composition of polypeptides and amino acids in pollen. The chemical composition of pollen differed significantly between the two plant species. Salix x multinervis offered pollen with higher polypeptide and essential amino acid contents than V. myrtillus. However, nectar quantities of V. myrtillus flowers were relatively high compared to S. x multinervis. During the overlapping flowering period of the two plant species, flower visitors seemed to favor high quality and easily accessible pollen of S. x multinervis species and visited V. myrtillus mainly for nectar resources.

Wild bees that nest or forage within agroecosystems may be exposed to numerous pesticides applied throughout their life cycles, with potential additive or synergistic effects. In pollinator-dependent crops, pesticides may reduce bee populations, creating trade-offs between pest management and crop pollination. In this three-year study, we examined the effects of pesticides on the abundance and species richness of wild bees within apple orchards of southern Wisconsin. We additionally deployed colonies of Bombus impatiens, a native and common species, in order to relate colony performance to orchard pesticide use. Utilizing grower spray records, we developed "toxicity scores" as a continuous index of pesticide use for each orchard, a measure that incorporated each pesticide's relative toxicity to bees, its residual activity, and its application rate. While there was no relationship between total wild bee abundance and species richness with toxicity scores, there was a significant, negative effect on sweat bees, Lasioglossum spp. Many of these sweat bees are small-bodied, have short foraging ranges, are social, and have long foraging periods, all traits that could increase bee exposure or sensitivity to orchard pesticides. In addition, sentinel bumble bee colonies at orchards with high toxicity scores produced fewer, and smaller, workers. Bumble bees may also have a greater sensitivity and exposure to orchard pesticides due to their sociality and long foraging periods. Our results demonstrate that certain bee taxa may have a higher exposure or sensitivity to on-farm pesticide applications, and could therefore be vulnerable in agroecosystems.

Hence, losses and declines of pollinating insect species threaten human food security and are of major concern not only for apiculture or agriculture but for human society in general. Honey bee colony losses and bumblebee declines have attracted intensive research interest over the last decade and although the problem is far from being solved we now know that viruses are among the key players of many of these bee losses and bumblebee declines. With this special issue on bee viruses we, therefore, aimed to collect high quality original papers reflecting the current state of bee virus research. To this end, we focused on newly discovered viruses (Lake Sinai viruses, bee macula-like virus), or a so far neglected virus species (Apis mellifera filamentous virus), and cutting edge technologies (mass spectrometry, RNAi approach) applied in the field.

P.			Native and Non-Native Supergeneralist Bee Species Have Different Effects on Plant-Bee Networks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POLLINATION NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; HABITAT LOSS; ARCHITECTURE; DIVERSITY; INVASION; COMMUNITIES; NESTEDNESS	Supergeneralists, defined as species that interact with multiple groups of species in ecological networks, can act as important connectors of otherwise disconnected species subsets. In Brazil, there are two supergeneralist bees: the honeybee Apis mellifera, a non-native species, and Trigona spinipes, a native stingless bee. We compared the role of both species and the effect of geographic and local factors on networks by addressing three questions: 1) Do both species have similar abundance and interaction patterns (degree and strength) in plant-bee networks? 2) Are both species equally influential to the network structure (nestedness, connectance, and plant and bee niche overlap)? 3) How are these species affected by geographic (altitude, temperature, precipitation) and local (natural vs. disturbed habitat) factors? We analyzed 21 plant-bee weighted interaction networks, encompassing most of the main biomes in Brazil. We found no significant difference between both species in abundance, in the number of plant species with which each bee species interacts (degree), and in the sum of their dependencies (strength). Structural equation models revealed the effect of A. mellifera and T. spinipes, respectively, on the interaction network pattern (nestedness) and in the similarity in bee's interactive partners (bee niche overlap). It is most likely that the recent invasion of A. mellifera resulted in its rapid settlement inside the core of species that retain the largest number of interactions, resulting in a strong influence on nestedness. However, the long-term interaction between native T. spinipes and other bees most likely has a more direct effect on their interactive behavior. Moreover, temperature negatively affected A. mellifera bees, whereas disturbed habitats positively affected T. spinipes. Conversely, precipitation showed no effect. Being positively (T. spinipes) or indifferently (A. mellifera) affected by disturbed habitats makes these species prone to pollinate plant species in these areas, which are potentially poor in pollinators.

Exposure to low doses of neonicotinoid insecticides has sub-lethal effects on social pollinators such as bumblebees and honeybees, disturbing their navigation and interfering with their development. Solitary Hymenoptera are also very important ecosystem service providers, but the sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids have not yet been studied well in those animals. We analyzed the ability of walking Osmia to remember a feeding place in a small environment and found that Osmia remembers the feeding place well after 4 days of training. Uptake of field-realistic amounts of the neonicotinoid clothianidin (0.76 ng per bee) altered the animals' sensory responses to the visual environment and interfered with the retrieval of navigational memory. We conclude that the neonicotinoid clothianidin compromises visual guidance and the use of navigational memory in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta.

J	Sardinas, HS; Kremen, C				Sardinas, Hillary S.; Kremen, Claire			Pollination services from field-scale agricultural diversification may be context-dependent	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Apoidea; Ecosystem services; Hedgerows; Mass-flowering crop; Restoration; Sunflower; Wild bees	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CROP POLLINATION; NATIVE BEES; HONEY-BEES; WILD; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; DECLINES	Diversification of field edges is widely used as a strategy to augment pollinator populations and, in turn, supplement crop pollination needs. Hedgerow plantings, a commonly applied field-scale diversification technique, have been shown to increase wild bee richness within edges and into crop fields; however, their effects on pollination services in mass-flowering, pollinator-dependent crops typical of large-scale commercial monocultures are less well-known. We evaluated the indirect contribution of hedgerows to sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seed set vis-a-vis wild bee abundance and the interaction between wild bees and managed honey bee pollinators. Although wild bee species richness and the interaction between wild and managed pollinators were significantly associated with augmented seed set, these factors were unrelated to whether a hedgerow was present. The pollinator species foraging within crop fields differed significantly from those found within adjacent hedgerows and bare or weedy field edges, with hedgerows supporting higher species richness than crop fields or unenhanced edges. However, in an independent data set, greater numbers of sunflower-pollinating bees were found in hedgerows than in control edges. Hedgerows may therefore help these crop-pollinating species persist in the landscape. Our findings suggest that hedgerows may not always simultaneously achieve crop pollination and wild bee conservation goals; instead, the benefits of hedgerows may be crop- and region-specific. We recommend evaluation of hedgerow benefits in a variety of crop and landscape contexts to improve their ability to meet ecosystem-service provisioning needs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Reduced-risk insecticides in Neotropical stingless bee species: impact on survival and activity	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY			English	Article						Behavioural impact; biopesticides; colony and individual level effects; native bee pollinators; sublethal effects	BOMBUS-IMPATIENS HYMENOPTERA; MELIPONA-QUADRIFASCIATA; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; BOTANICAL INSECTICIDE; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; HONEY-BEES; PESTICIDES; TOXICITY; SPINOSAD; NEONICOTINOIDS	As honeybees are the main pollinator subject to an intense research regarding effects of pesticides, other ecologically important native bee pollinators have received little attention in ecotoxicology and risk assessment of pesticides in general, and insecticides in particular, some of which are perceived as reduced-risk compounds. Here, the impact of three reduced-risk insecticides - azadirachtin, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole - was assessed in two species of stingless bees, Partamona helleri and Scaptotrigona xanthotrica, which are important native pollinators in Neotropical America. The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a positive control. Spinosad exhibited high oral and contact toxicities in adult workers of both species at the recommended label rates, with median survival times (LT(50)s) ranging from 1 to 4 h, whereas these estimates were below 15 min for imidacloprid. Azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole exhibited low toxicity at the recommended label rates, with negligible mortality that did not allow LT50 estimation. Sublethal behavioural assessments of these two insecticides indicated that neither one of them affected the overall group activity of workers of the two species. However, both azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole impaired individual flight take-off of P. helleri and S. xanthotrica worker bees, which may compromise foraging activity, potentially leading to reduced colony survival. These findings challenge the common perception of non-target safety of reduced-risk insecticides and bioinsecticides, particularly regarding native pollinator species.	[Tome, H. V. V.; Barbosa, W.

Detection of diploid males, and discrimination from haploid males and workers, has, however, been limited to molecular diagnostics. Here we present a novel method based on differences in wing shape, e.g., venation patterns in wings. The method is easy to apply and results, for Bombus terrestris, in very high discrimination success. Possible applications of the method are discussed.

J	Russo, L; Park, M; Gibbs, J; Danforth, B				Russo, Laura; Park, Mia; Gibbs, Jason; Danforth, Bryan			The challenge of accurately documenting bee species richness in agroecosystems: bee diversity in eastern apple orchards	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Agroecosystem; apple orchard; bee diversity; biodiversity; ecosystem function; pollination services; sampling	HYMENOPTERA APOIDEA ANTHOPHILA; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; POLLINATORS; LANDSCAPE; ABUNDANCE; INCREASES; PATTERNS; REVISION; NUMBER	Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops, and bee diversity has been shown to be closely associated with pollination, a valuable ecosystem service. Higher functional diversity and species richness of bees have been shown to lead to higher crop yield. Bees simultaneously represent a mega-diverse taxon that is extremely challenging to sample thoroughly and an important group to understand because of pollination services. We sampled bees visiting apple blossoms in 28 orchards over 6years. We used species rarefaction analyses to test for the completeness of sampling and the relationship between species richness and sampling effort, orchard size, and percent agriculture in the surrounding landscape. We performed more than 190h of sampling, collecting 11,219 specimens representing 104 species. Despite the sampling intensity, we captured <75% of expected species richness at more than half of the sites. For most of these, the variation in bee community composition between years was greater than among sites. Species richness was influenced by percent agriculture, orchard size, and sampling effort, but we found no factors explaining the difference between observed and expected species richness. Competition between honeybees and wild bees did not appear to be a factor, as we found no correlation between honeybee and wild bee abundance. Our study shows that the pollinator fauna of agroecosystems can be diverse and challenging to thoroughly sample. We demonstrate that there is high temporal variation in community composition and that sites vary widely in the sampling effort required to fully describe their diversity. In order to maximize pollination services provided by wild bee species, we must first accurately estimate species richness. For researchers interested in providing this estimate, we recommend multiyear studies and rarefaction analyses to quantify the gap between observed and expected species richness.

High prevalence and infection levels of Nosema ceranae in bumblebees Bombus atratus and Bombus bellicosus from Uruguay	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Microsporidia; Parasites; Nosemosis	HONEYBEES APIS-MELLIFERA; MICROSPORIDIAN PARASITE; PATHOGEN; POPULATIONS; HYMENOPTERA; APIDAE; HOST; SPP.	Nosema ceranae is one of the most prevalent pathogens in Apis mellifera and has recently been found in multiple host species including several species of bumblebees. Prevalence and infection intensity of N. ceranae was determined in two species of native bumblebees from Uruguay. Nosema ceranae was the only microsporidia identified and mean prevalence was 72% in Bombus atratus and 63% in Bombus bellicosus, values much higher than those reported elsewhere. The presence of this pathogen in bumblebees may be threatening not only for bumblebee populations, but also to the rest of the native pollinator community and to honeybees. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Effects of Fungicide and Adjuvant Sprays on Nesting Behavior in Two Managed Solitary Bees, Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata	PLOS ONE			English	Article							APIDAE COLONY HEALTH; APIS-MELLIFERA L; HONEY-BEE; NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; OLFACTORY CUES; BUMBLE BEES; POLLINATORS	There is a growing body of empirical evidence showing that wild and managed bees are negatively impacted by various pesticides that are applied in agroecosystems around the world. The lethal and sublethal effects of two widely used fungicides and one adjuvant were assessed in cage studies in California on blue orchard bees, Osmia lignaria, and in cage studies in Utah on alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata. The fungicides tested were Rovral 4F (iprodione) and Pristine (mixture of pyraclostrobin + boscalid), and the adjuvant tested was N-90, a non-ionic wetting agent (90% polyethoxylated nonylphenol) added to certain tank mixtures of fungicides to improve the distribution and contact of sprays to plants. In separate trials, we erected screened cages and released 20 paint-marked females plus 30-50 males per cage to document the behavior of nesting bees under treated and control conditions. For all females in each cage, we recorded pollen-collecting trip times, nest substrate-collecting trip times (i.e., mud for O. lignaria and cut leaf pieces for M. rotundata), cell production rate, and the number of attempts each female made to enter her own or to enter other nest entrances upon returning from a foraging trip. No lethal effects of treatments were observed on adults, nor were there effects on time spent foraging for pollen and nest substrates and on cell production rate. However, Rovral 4F, Pristine, and N-90 disrupted the nest recognition abilities of O. lignaria females. Pristine, N-90, and Pristine + N-90 disrupted nest recognition ability of M. rotundata females. Electroantennogram responses of antennae of O. lignaria females maintained in the laboratory did not differ significantly between the fungicide-exposed and control bees. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that two commonly used fungicides and a non-ionic adjuvant can disrupt nest recognition in two managed solitary bee species.

Integrated pest and pollinator management - adding a new dimension to an accepted paradigm	CURRENT OPINION IN INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article							NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES; PEACH ORCHARDS; BEES; TOXICITY; FUNGICIDES; PROGRAMS	In this chapter we argue that while pesticides can be harmful to pollinators, when they are used in an integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM) context, both pest management and pollinator protection may be achieved. Our growing knowledge of the impacts of pesticides on honey bees as well as bumble bees and solitary bees allows us to use the latitude we have in pest management including non-pesticidal pest management practices, changing pesticide types and incorporating other, less susceptible pollinator species into commercial practice. Pollinator health should be a central component of integrated pest management research, education and extension to produce viable IPPM approaches.

Exposure Effects on the Productivity of Commercial Bombus impatiens (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Quads During Bloom in Watermelon Fields	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bombus impatiens; foraging activity; commercial quad; watermelon	BUMBLE BEE HYMENOPTERA; APIS-MELLIFERA; POLLINATION; TEMPERATURE	In light of population declines of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), research has refocused attention on alternative pollinators and their potential to fulfill pollination services within economically important agricultural crops. Bumble bees are one such alternative, and within the past 20 yr, these pollinators have been reared and sold as commercial pollinators. Investigation into their use has been limited and more research is needed to improve pollinator effectiveness in field settings. Quad pollination units of the commercially reared native bumble bee species, the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson), were monitored and evaluated for productivity during peak watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunberg) Matsumura & Nakai] bloom in southern Delaware. Differing colony exposures including various shade structure designs and natural shade were compared to assess the quality of the shade in regards to bumble bee activity during watermelon bloom. Quads receiving different nest treatments were evaluated on the basis of foraging activity and colony weight gain. Results indicated that colonies within quads provided with artificial or natural shade had significantly more foraging activity, weighed more, and produced more cells than colonies in quads placed in the field with no shade. Colonies within quads provided with artificial and natural shade peaked later in terms of foraging and weight gain, suggesting that growers could extend harvest to take advantage of later markets and possible movement into fields that were planted later.

Museum samples reveal rapid evolution by wild honey bees exposed to a novel parasite	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GENERATION SEQUENCING DATA; NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; APIS-MELLIFERA; VARROA-DESTRUCTOR; GENETIC DIVERSITY; ALLELE FREQUENCY; EMERGING DISEASE; WORKER BROOD; POPULATION; COLONIES	Understanding genetic changes caused by novel pathogens and parasites can reveal mechanisms of adaptation and genetic robustness. Using whole-genome sequencing of museum and modern specimens, we describe the genomic changes in a wild population of honey bees in North America following the introduction of the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. Even though colony density in the study population is the same today as in the past, a major loss of haplotypic diversity occurred, indicative of a drastic mitochondrial bottleneck, caused by massive colony mortality. In contrast, nuclear genetic diversity did not change, though hundreds of genes show signs of selection. The genetic diversity within each bee colony, particularly as a consequence of polyandry by queens, may enable preservation of genetic diversity even during population bottlenecks. These findings suggest that genetically diverse honey bee populations can recover from introduced diseases by evolving rapid tolerance, while maintaining much of the standing genetic variation.

Management of Overwintering Cover Crops Influences Floral Resources and Visitation by Native Bees	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						flowering cover crop; native bee; conservation; agriculture	COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER; OILSEED RAPE; WILD BEES; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; POLLINATOR ACTIVITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LANDSCAPE-SCALE; BRASSICA-NAPUS; PLANTING DATE; BUMBLE BEES	The incorporation of cover crops into annual crop rotations is one practice that is used in the Mid-Atlantic United States to manage soil fertility, suppress weeds, and control erosion. Additionally, flowering cover crops have the potential to support beneficial insect communities, such as native bees. Because of the current declines in managed honey bee colonies, the conservation of native bee communities is critical to maintaining "free" pollination services. However, native bees are negatively affected by agricultural intensification and are also in decline across North America. We conducted two experiments to assess the potential of flowering cover crops to act as a conservation resource for native bees. We evaluated the effects of cover crop diversity and fall planting date on floral resource availability and visitation by native bees for overwintering flowering cover crop species commonly used in the Mid-Atlantic region. Cover crop species, crop rotation schedule, and plant diversity significantly influenced floral resource availability. Different cover crop species not only had different blooming phenologies and winter survival responses to planting date, but attracted unique bee communities. Flower density was the primary factor influencing frequency of bee visitation across cover crop diversity and fall planting date treatments. The results from these experiments will be useful for informing recommendations on the applied use of flowering cover crops for pollinator conservation purposes.

Resource Effects on Solitary Bee Reproduction in a Managed Crop Pollination System	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						density dependence; maternal investment; Megachile rotundata; Megachilidae; Medicago sativa	ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE; HYMENOPTERA-MEGACHILIDAE; SEX-RATIO; SEED; ALLOCATION; ROTUNDATA; AVAILABILITY; POPULATIONS; INVESTMENT; IMPACT	Population density may affect solitary bee maternal resource allocation. The number of Megachile rotundata (F.), alfalfa leafcutting bee, females released for seed production of Medicago sativa L., alfalfa, may limit flower availability for nest provisioning. In turn, pollinator abundance also may affect crop yield. The M. sativa pollination system presents an opportunity to test for effects of density dependence and maternal manipulation on M. rotundata reproduction. A multiyear study was performed on M. sativa fields upon which M. rotundata densities were altered to induce low, medium, and high density situations. Numbers of adult bees and open flowers were recorded weekly; bee reproduction variables were collected once. Fields varied in plant performance for each site and year, and the intended bee densities were not realized. Therefore, the variable density index (DI) was derived to describe the number of female bees per area of flowers over the study period. As DI increased, percentages of pollinated flowers, established females, and healthy brood significantly increased, and the number of pollinated flowers per female and of dead or diseased brood significantly decreased. Sex ratio was significantly more female biased as DI increased. Overwintered offspring weights were similar regardless of DI, but significantly differed by year for both sexes, and for males also by field and year x field interaction. Overall, resource limitation was not found in this field study. Other density-dependent factors may have induced a bee dispersal response soon after bees were released in the fields that circumvented the need for, or impact of, maternal manipulation.

Recent introduction of an allodapine bee into Fiji: A new model system for understanding biological invasions by pollinators	INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						Allodapini; exotic species; Fiji; long distance dispersal; pollinator competition	SEX ALLOCATION; NATIVE BEES; HYMENOPTERA; INSURANCE; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; SOCIALITY; HALICTINE; DECLINES; INSIGHTS	Morphology-based studies have suggested a very depauperate bee fauna for islands in the South West Pacific, and recent genetic studies since have indicated an even smaller endemic fauna with many bee species in this region resulting from human-aided dispersal. These introduced species have the potential to both disrupt native pollinator suites as well as augment crop pollination, but for most species the timings of introduction are unknown. We examined the distribution and nesting biology of the long-tongued bee Braunsapis puangensis that was first recorded from Fiji in 2007. This bee has now become widespread in Fiji and both its local abundance and geographical range are likely to increase dramatically. The impacts of this invasion are potentially enormous for agriculture and native ecosystems, but they also provide opportunities for understanding how social insect species adapt to new environments. We outline the major issues associated with this recent invasion and argue that a long-term monitoring study is needed.	[Groom, Scott V.

How can an understanding of plant-pollinator interactions contribute to global food security?	CURRENT OPINION IN PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Review							MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; FLORAL NECTAR; OILSEED RAPE; SEED PRODUCTION; AMINO-ACIDS; HONEY-BEES; BRASSICA-NAPUS; BUMBLE BEES; VICIA-FABA; ANTIRRHINUM	Pollination of crops by animals is an essential part of global food production, but evidence suggests that wild pollinator populations may be declining while a number of problems are besetting managed honey bee colonies. Animal-pollinated crops grown today, bred in an environment where pollination was less likely to limit fruit set, are often suboptimal in attracting and sustaining their pollinator populations. Research into plant pollinator interactions is often conducted in a curiosity-driven, ecological framework, but may inform breeding and biotechnological approaches to enhance pollinator attraction and crop yield. In this article we review key topics in current plant pollinator research that have potential roles in future crop breeding for enhanced global food security.

Changes to plant community composition after invasion are well documented but how these shifts directly affect higher trophic levels is still poorly understood. One potentially important factor is the change in nutritional availability after an invasion. Shifts in nutrient availability could affect the nutrient intake of organisms that live in invaded habitats, causing reduced fecundity and survival. 2. The effects of the interaction among nutrient availability, selection, and diet on nutrient intake of a native bumble bee were examined. No nutritional differences were found between exotic and native pollen or collected and non-collected pollen in protein or amino acid content, suggesting that differences in nutrient intake from random are based on selection. 3. Nutrient intake was simulated when pollen was selected randomly across all available plant species and when selection was restricted to native plants only or exotic plants only using a permutation model and compared with observed collection. The results suggest that pollen collection is non-random and that selecting only native or exotic plants cannot provide the protein or amino acid intake observed. 4. These results may help to explain why the responses of native bees to exotic plants are so variable. If the exotic plants in a community can supply the necessary nutrients, bees may readily incorporate them into their diets, but if not, exotic plants may be avoided.

J	Feltham, H; Park, K; Minderman, J; Goulson, D				Feltham, Hannah; Park, Kirsty; Minderman, Jeroen; Goulson, Dave			Experimental evidence that wildflower strips increase pollinator visits to crops	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Agriculture; Bombus; commercial pollinators; ecosystem service; management; sustainability; wild bees	ARABLE FIELD MARGINS; INSECT POLLINATORS; BEE ABUNDANCE; BUMBLE BEES; HONEY-BEE; SERVICES; HYMENOPTERA; LANDSCAPES; STRAWBERRY; FARMLAND	Wild bees provide a free and potentially diverse ecosystem service to farmers growing pollination-dependent crops. While many crops benefit from insect pollination, soft fruit crops, including strawberries are highly dependent on this ecosystem service to produce viable fruit. However, as a result of intensive farming practices and declining pollinator populations, farmers are increasingly turning to commercially reared bees to ensure that crops are adequately pollinated throughout the season. Wildflower strips are a commonly used measure aimed at the conservation of wild pollinators. It has been suggested that commercial crops may also benefit from the presence of noncrop flowers; however, the efficacy and economic benefits of sowing flower strips for crops remain relatively unstudied. In a study system that utilizes both wild and commercial pollinators, we test whether wildflower strips increase the number of visits to adjacent commercial strawberry crops by pollinating insects. We quantified this by experimentally sowing wildflower strips approximately 20 meters away from the crop and recording the number of pollinator visits to crops with, and without, flower strips. Between June and August 2013, we walked 292 crop transects at six farms in Scotland, recording a total of 2826 pollinators. On average, the frequency of pollinator visits was 25% higher for crops with adjacent flower strips compared to those without, with a combination of wild and commercial bumblebees (Bombus spp.) accounting for 67% of all pollinators observed. This effect was independent of other confounding effects, such as the number of flowers on the crop, date, and temperature. Synthesis and applications. This study provides evidence that soft fruit farmers can increase the number of pollinators that visit their crops by sowing inexpensive flower seed mixes nearby. By investing in this management option, farmers have the potential to increase and sustain pollinator populations over time.

Abundance and Diversity of Wild Bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) Found in Lowbush Blueberry Growing Regions of Downeast Maine	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						pollination service; bee diversity; Vaccinium angustifolium; Apoidea; Bombus	NATIVE BEES; BUMBLE BEES; POLLINATION; DECLINE; BIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPES; CONSERVATION; ANTHOPHILA; BOMBUS	Insect-mediated pollination is critical for lowbush blueberry (Ericaceae: Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) fruit development. Past research shows a persistent presence of wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) providing pollination services even when commercial pollinators are present. We undertook the study to 1) provide a description of bee communities found in lowbush blueberry-growing regions, 2) identify field characteristics or farm management practices that influence those communities, 3) identify key wild bee pollinators that provide pollination services for the blueberry crop, and 4) identify non-crop plants found within the cropping system that provide forage for wild bees. During a 4-year period, we collected solitary and eusocial bees in over 40 fields during and after blueberry bloom, determining a management description for each field. We collected 4,474 solitary bees representing 124 species and 1,315 summer bumble bees representing nine species. No bumble bee species were previously unknown in Maine, yet we document seven solitary bee species new for the state. These include species of the genera Nomada, Lasioglossum, Calliopsis, and Augochloropsis. No field characteristic or farm management practice related to bee community structure, except bumble bee species richness was higher in certified organic fields. Pollen analysis determined scopal loads of 67-99% ericaceous pollen carried by five species of Andrena. Our data suggest two native ericaceous plants, Kalmia angustifolia L. and Gaylussacia baccata (Wangenheim), provide important alternative floral resources. We conclude that Maine blueberry croplands are populated with a species-rich bee community that fluctuates in time and space. We suggest growers develop and maintain wild bee forage and nest sites.

Pesticides and reduced-risk insecticides, native bees and pantropical stingless bees: pitfalls and perspectives	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						bioinsecticides; biorational insecticides; insecticidal stress; Meliponini; wild pollinators	HONEY-BEE; COLONY LOSSES; MELIPONA-QUADRIFASCIATA; TOXICITY; IMPACT; HYMENOPTERA; POLLINATOR; APIDAE; NEONICOTINOIDS; METAANALYSIS	Although invertebrates generally have a low public profile, the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is a flagship species whose popularity likely derives from the products it provides and its perceived ecological services. Therefore, the raging debate regarding honey bee decline has surpassed the realm of beekeepers, academia, industry and regulatory agencies and now also encompasses non-governmental agencies, media, fiction writers and the general public. The early interest and concern about honey bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) soon shifted to the bigger issue of pollinator decline, with a focus on the potential involvement of pesticides in such a phenomenon. Pesticides were previously recognised as the potential culprits of the reported declines, particularly the neonicotinoid insecticides owing to their widespread and peculiar use in agriculture. However, the evidence for the potential pivotal role of these neonicotinoids in honey bee decline remains a matter of debate, with an increased recognition of the multifactorial nature of the problem and the lack of a direct association between the noted decline and neonicotinoid use. The focus on the decline of honey bee populations subsequently spread to other species, and bumblebees became another matter of concern, particularly in Europe and the United States. Other bee species, ones that are particularly important in other regions of the world, remain the object of little concern (unjustifiably so). Furthermore, the continuous focus on neonicotinoids is also in need of revision, as the current evidence suggests that a broad spectrum of compounds deserve attention. Here we address both shortcomings.

The current losses in honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) colonies pose a serious threat to the blueberry industry, raising interest in alternative pollinators. Abundance and diversity of native pollinators usually decreases with distance from natural habitats. In this study, we evaluated the effects of distance from wooded habitats such as windbreaks and forest borders on the presence of native pollinators in blueberry fields in Lac-St-Jean (Quebec, Canada). Four treatments were compared: single-row, double-row, natural windbreaks, and forest borders. Pan-traps were placed at 5, 30, and 60 m from the windbreak or forest border. A total of 3878 native pollinators were collected and 81% were ground-nesting bees. The forest border was the only treatment with higher abundance and species richness on the periphery (5 m) of the field than at further distances, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of pollinators is favoured by habitats potentially offering more abundant and diverse nutritional resources. Our overall results reveal that native pollinators are distributed quite homogeneously in blueberry fields, suggesting that windbreaks are beneficial to native pollinator communities.

Neonicotinoids have been shown to increase acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in honey bees at sublethal doses. High AChE levels may therefore act as a biomarker of exposure to neonicotinoids. This two-year study focused on establishing whether bumble bees living and foraging in agricultural areas using neonicotinoid crop protection show early biochemical signs of intoxication. Bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) were placed in two different agricultural cropping areas: 1) control (>= 3 km from fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds) or 2) exposed (within 500 m of fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds), and maintained for the duration of corn sowing. As determined by Real Time qPCR, AChE mRNA expression was initially significantly higher in bumble bees from exposed sites, then decreased throughout the planting season to reach a similar endpoint to that of bumble bees from control sites. These findings suggest that exposure to neonicotinoid seed coating particles during the planting season can alter bumble bee neuronal activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report in situ that bumble bees living in agricultural areas exhibit signs of neonicotinoid intoxication.

The bee-specialist genera Bettsia, Ascosphaera and Eremascus are remarkable not only for their specialized niche but also for their simple fruiting bodies or ascocarps, which are morphologically anomalous in Pezizomycotina. Bettsia and Ascosphaera are characterized by a unicellular cyst-like cleistothecium known as a spore cyst, while Eremascus is characterized by completely naked asci, or asci not formed within a protective ascocarp. Before molecular phylogenetics the placement of these genera within Pezizomycotina remained tentative; morphological characters were misleading because they do not produce multicellular ascocarps, a defining character of Pezizomycotina. Because of their unique fruiting bodies, the close relationship of these bee-specialist fungi and their monophyly appeared certain. However, recent molecular studies have shown that Bettsia is not closely related to Ascosphaera. In this study, I isolated the very rare fungus Eremascus fertilis (Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina) from the bee bread of honey bees. These isolates represent the second report of E. fertilis both in nature and in the honey bee hive. To establish the systematic position of E. fertilis and Bettsia alvei, I performed phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal LSU + SSU DNA sequences from these species and 63 additional ascomycetes. Results: The phylogenetic analyses revealed that Eremascus is not monophyletic. Eremascus albus is closely related to Ascosphaera in Eurotiomycetes while E. fertilis belongs in Myxotrichaceae, a putative member of Leotiomycetes. Bettsia is not closely related to Ascosphaera and like E. fertilis apparently belongs in Leotiomycetes. These results indicate that both the naked ascus and spore cyst evolved twice in the Pezizomycotina and in distantly related lineages. The new genus Skoua is described to accommodate E. fertilis. Conclusions: The naked ascus and spore cyst are both shown to have evolved convergently within the bee habitat. The convergent evolution of these unusual ascocarps is hypothesized to be adaptive for bee-mediated dispersal. Elucidating the dispersal strategies of these fungal symbionts contributes to our understanding of their interaction with bees and provides insight into the factors which potentially drive the evolution of reduced ascocarps in Pezizomycotina.

In the canola crop, production is partially dependent on insect pollination. Therefore, knowledge of the faunal diversity within and near crop fields is key for the management of these insects and consequently for the increase in productivity. This study aimed to determine and compare the diversity of bees in habitats associated with canola fields in southern Brazil. Bees were captured in four agricultural areas using pan traps in three habitat classes: (1) flowering canola crop, (2) forest remnant, and (3) grassland vegetation. The highest abundance of bees was observed in the grassland vegetation (50%) and in the flowering canola field (47%). Eight species common to the three habitat classes were recorded, four of which are represented by native social bees. In addition, a single or a few individuals represented species that were exclusive to a specific habitat class; eight species were collected exclusively in the interior of the canola field, 51 in the grassland vegetation, and six in the forest remnant. The majority of the rare species recorded exhibits subsocial or solitary behaviour and inhabit open places. The composition of bee groups differed between the habitats showing the importance of maintaining habitat mosaics with friendly areas for pollinators, which promote the pollination service for canola flowers.

Genetic differentiation of local populations of the dark European bee Apis mellifera mellifera L. in the Urals	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article							MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; HONEYBEE; MICROSATELLITE; YUCATAN	For the last two centuries, beekeepers in Russia and Europe have been introducing bees from the southern regions to the northern ones, subjecting the genetic pool of the dark European bee Apis mellifera mellifera L. subspecies to extensive hybridization. In order to reconfirm on the genetic level the previously published morphological data on the native bee population in the Urals, the Bashkortostan Republic, and the Perm Krai, we analyzed the polymorphism of the mitochondrial (mtDNA COI-COII intergenic locus) and nuclear (two microsatellite loci, ap243 and 4a110) DNA markers. Four local populations of the dark European bee A. m. mellifera surviving in the Urals have been identified, and their principal genetic characteristics have been determined. Data on the genetic structure and geographical localization of the areals of the dark European bee local populations in the Urals may be of use in restoring the damaged genetic pool of A. m. mellifera in Russia and other northern countries.

A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						Agro-ecology; Ecosystem services; Pollination; Competition; Crop production; Trophic network	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; INSECT-POLLINATED PLANTS; MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; LAND-USE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; WILD BEES; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; HERBICIDE RESISTANCE	Agricultural intensification has led to the decrease of the diversity of wild and domestic pollinators. For instance, honeybees declined by 59 % in 61 years in the USA. About 35 % of major crops in the world depend on pollination services, and 3-8 % of world crop production will disappear without pollinators. Indeed, pollination provides several ecosystem services such as enabling crop and honey productions, regulating weeds and other cultural services. Agricultural intensification has also decreased weed diversity by about 50 % in 70 years because massive herbicide sprays have reduced the competition between weeds and crops. Nevertheless, weeds are at the basis of agricultural foodwebs, providing food to many living organisms. In particular, weeds provide flowers for pollinating insects including honey and wild bees. Here, we review the decline of weeds and bees. We discuss the effect of bees and pollination on crop production. We describe the complex interactions between bee pollinators, e.g. honey and wild bees, and landscape habitats such as crop fields and semi-natural elements. For that, we focus on spatial and temporal effects on flower resources. We show that weed abundance can reduce crop yields, thus inducing conflict with farmers. But weed abundance enhances regulating services by ensuring the survival of honeybees in the absence of oil seed crops. Weed abundance also enhances pollination services and, in turn, honey yield for the benefit of beekeepers. Weed abundance has also improved the survival of wild flora and the socio-cultural value of landscapes, a major request from the public. From those findings, we present a conceptual framework allowing to define ecological engineering options based upon ecosystem services of weeds and pollinators.

The conservation value of urban green space habitats for Australian native bee communities	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Bees; Pollinators; Urban ecology; Urban landscapes	CROP POLLINATION; WILD POLLINATORS; HYMENOPTERA; PLANTS; DECLINES; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES; RICHNESS; BACKYARD; GARDENS	Networks of urban green space can provide critical resources for wild bees, however it is unclear which attributes of green spaces provide these resources, or how their management can be improved to benefit a diversity of bee species. We examined bee communities in three dominant urban green space habitats: (1) golf courses (2) public parks and (3) front gardens and streetscapes in residential neighbourhoods in Melbourne, Australia and assessed which local and landscape attributes influenced bee communities. There was a greater abundance and richness of bee species in public parks compared to golf courses and residential neighbourhoods, where the latter habitat was dominated by European Honeybees (Apis mellifera). The occurrence of A. mellifera was positively associated with increases in flowering and native plants. Ground-nesting Homalictus species occurred more frequently in older golf courses and public parks surrounded by low impervious surface cover, and with a low diversity of flowering plants. Cavity nesting, floral specialists within the Colletidae family occurred more often in green space habitats with greater native vegetation, and occurred infrequently in residential neighbourhoods. The lack of appropriate nesting habitat and dominance of exotic flowering plants in residential neighbourhoods appeared to positively impact upon the generalist A. mellifera, but negatively affected cavity and ground nesting floral specialist bee species (e.g. Halictidae and Colletidae). Our results highlight the need to include urban areas in pollinator conservation initiatives, as providing resources critical to diverse bee communities can assist in maintaining these key pollinators in urban landscapes.

J	Sachman-Ruiz, B; Narvaez-Padilla, V; Reynaud, E				Sachman-Ruiz, Bernardo; Narvaez-Padilla, Veronica; Reynaud, Enrique			Commercial Bombus impatiens as reservoirs of emerging infectious diseases in central Mexico	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Colony collapse disorder; Bumble bee diagnosis; Emerging infectious diseases; Pathogen spillover	ACUTE PARALYSIS VIRUS; HONEYBEES APIS-MELLIFERA; DICISTROVIRUS AFFECTING HONEYBEES; DEFORMED-WING VIRUS; KASHMIR BEE VIRUS; BUMBLE BEE; EUROPEAN BUMBLEBEE; PATHOGEN SPILLOVER; 1ST DETECTION; HYMENOPTERA	The rapid decline in range and relative abundance of some wild North American bumble bee species, combined with the commercialization of bumble bee colonies as agricultural pollinators, and recent evidence that bumble bees can be infected by honey bee viruses, suggest the possibility that invasive and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) may play a substantial current and future role in the decline of wild bumble bee populations. Pollination in North American greenhouses is primarily mediated by industrially produced Bombus impatiens colonies. The use of B. impatiens is preferred in greenhouses because it is a native species of East North America and they are very efficient pollinators. However, B. impatiens is also host of various viruses that have been associated with colony collapse disorder in honey bees, as well as hosts to a number of bumble bee-specific pathogens and parasites. In this study, we used qPCR to screen adult worker bumble bees collected from 120 different greenhouses in central Mexico. Fifty-four locations were positive for one or more pathogens (45 %). The most frequently detected pathogen was Apicystis bombi, which was present in 32 colonies. Of these 32 A. bombi positive colonies, 15 were co-infected with at least one other pathogen or parasite, such as Locustacarus buchneri, Nosema bombi, or the viral pathogens ABPV, CBPV, DWV, IAPV and KBV. Routine use of this type of screening technology together with policy changes to restrict pathogen infested commercial bumble bees should help improve the selection of healthy commercial colonies of B. impatiens and could lead to a higher efficiency in greenhouse pollination thus providing better environmental conservation of natural Bombus spp. by preventing spillover of EIDs.

(Cucurbitaceae) in the Guatemalan cloud forest	PAN-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGIST			English	Article						Crop pollination; guicoy; honey bees; squash bees; stingless bees	CROP POLLINATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; HYMENOPTERA; SQUASH; COMMUNITIES; PEPONAPIS; APIDAE; AREA	Cucurbita pepo L. (Cucurbitaceae) was an integral component of the diet of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures and is an important cash crop with high cultural value in contemporaneous indigenous populations of Guatemala. Despite the increasing attention to native bees as pollinators of cucurbit crops, little is known about the diversity of bees that visit or pollinate these crops in many regions. Based on collections from 11 observational plots of C. pepo established in five localities and maintained by the local community across the Cloud Forest Corridor in Guatemala, we documented 27 bee species belonging to 14 genera in Apidae and Halictidae as floral visitors. Species composition was significantly different among plots and among localities; however, honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758) (Apidae: Apini) and the stingless bee Partamona bilineata (Say, 1837) (Apidae: Meliponini) were the most abundant flower visitors in all plots and localities, accounting up to 80% of the total number of visits. Two species of squash bees were recorded, Peponapis apiculata (Cresson, 1878) and P. limitaris (Cockerel], 1906) (Apidae: Eucerini), but they were rare (3.4% of total number of specimens) across all plots and localities. Based on pollinator exclusion experiments as well as comparisons of fruit weight and seed number and weight, we confirmed the dependence of this crop on insect pollination and the role of honey bees and P. bilineata as main pollinators in the observational plots. Surveys of bees in the surrounding vegetation of the plots indicated a higher diversity (36 species of 28 genera) than in the plots; about 40% of these species are also common visitors of flowers of C. pepo.

Introduction of Non-Native Pollinators Can Lead to Trans-Continental Movement of Bee-Associated Fungi	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OSMIA-LIGNARIA HYMENOPTERA; COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER; PAENIBACILLUS-LARVAE; MEGACHILE-ROTUNDATA; NOSEMA-CERANAE; HONEY; ASPERGILLOSIS; PHYLOGENY; PERFORMANCE; INFECTIONS	Bees are essential pollinators for many flowering plants, including agriculturally important crops such as apple. As geographic ranges of bees or their host plants change as a result of human activities, we need to identify pathogens that could be transmitted among newly sympatric species to evaluate and anticipate their effects on bee communities. We used PCR screening and DNA sequencing to evaluate exposure to potentially disease-causing microorganisms in a pollinator of apple, the horned mason bee (Osmia cornifrons). We did not detect microsporidia, Wolbachia, or trypanosomes, which are common pathogens of bees, in any of the hundreds of mason bees screened. We did detect both pathogenic and apathogenic (saprophytic) fungal species in the genus Ascosphaera (chalkbrood), an unidentified species of Aspergillus fungus, and a strain of bacteria in the genus Paenibacillus that is probably apathogenic. We detected pathogenic fungal strains in asymptomatic adult bees that therefore may be carriers of disease. We demonstrate that fungi from the genus Ascosphaera have been transported to North America along with the bee from its native range in Japan, and that O. cornifrons is exposed to fungi previously only identified from nests of other related bee species. Further study will be required to quantify pathogenicity and health effects of these different microbial species on O. cornifrons and on closely-related native North American mason bees that may now be exposed to novel pathogens. A global perspective is required for pathogen research as geographic ranges of insects and microorganisms shift due to intentional or accidental introductions.

Negative effects of pesticides on wild bee communities can be buffered by landscape context	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						agroecosystem; native bees; pest management; apple; orchards	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; AD MODEL BUILDER; HONEY-BEE; POLLINATORS; INSECTICIDE; FUNGICIDES; RESPONSES; PEST; METAANALYSIS; HYMENOPTERA	Wild bee communities provide underappreciated but critical agricultural pollination services. Given predicted global shortages in pollination services, managing agroecosystems to support thriving wild bee communities is, therefore, central to ensuring sustainable food production. Benefits of natural (including semi-natural) habitat for wild bee abundance and diversity on farms are well documented. By contrast, few studies have examined toxicity of pesticides on wild bees, let alone effects of farm-level pesticide exposure on entire bee communities. Whether beneficial natural areas could mediate effects of harmful pesticides on wild bees is also unknown. Here, we assess the effect of conventional pesticide use on the wild bee community visiting apple (Malus domestica) within a gradient of percentage natural area in the landscape. Wild bee community abundance and species richness decreased linearly with increasing pesticide use in orchards one year after application; however, pesticide effects on wild bees were buffered by increasing proportion of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape. A significant contribution of fungicides to observed pesticide effects suggests deleterious properties of a class of pesticides that was, until recently, considered benign to bees. Our results demonstrate extended benefits of natural areas for wild pollinators and highlight the importance of considering the landscape context when weighing up the costs of pest management on crop pollination services.

A neonicotinoid impairs olfactory learning in Asian honey bees (Apis cerana) exposed as larvae or as adults	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROBOSCIS EXTENSION; MELLIFERA; PESTICIDES; MEMORY; DELTAMETHRIN; PERFORMANCES; METAANALYSIS; POLLINATION; SEMIFIELD; TOXICITY	Xenobiotics such as the neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, are used globally, but their effects on native bee species are poorly understood. We studied the effects of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on olfactory learning in the native honey bee species, Apis cerana, an important pollinator of agricultural and native plants throughout Asia. We provide the first evidence that imidacloprid can impair learning in A. cerana workers exposed as adults or as larvae. Adults that ingested a single imidacloprid dose as low as 0.1 ng/bee had significantly reduced olfactory learning acquisition, which was 1.6-fold higher in control bees. Longer-term learning (1-17 h after the last learning trial) was also impaired. Bees exposed as larvae to a total dose of 0.24 ng/bee did not have reduced survival to adulthood. However, these larval-treated bees had significantly impaired olfactory learning when tested as adults: control bees exhibited up to 4.8-fold better short-term learning acquisition, though longer-term learning was not affected. Thus, sublethal cognitive deficits elicited by neonicotinoids on a broad range of native bee species deserve further study.

IAPV infection in honeybees has been successfully repressed by exploiting the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway of the insect's innate immune response with virus-specific double stranded RNA (dsRNA). Here we investigated the effect of IAPV infection in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris and its tissue tropism. B. terrestris is a common pollinator of wild flowers in Europe and is used for biological pollination in agriculture. Infection experiments demonstrated a similar pathology and tissue tropism in bumblebees as reported for honeybees. The effect of oral administration of virus-specific dsRNA was examined and resulted in an effective silencing of the virus, irrespective of the length. Interestingly, we observed that non-specific dsRNA was also efficient against IAPV. However further study is needed to clarify the precise mechanism behind this effect. Finally we believe that our data are indicative of the possibility to use dsRNA for a broad range viral protection in bumblebees.

Merrill, flowers can be a source of nectar and pollen for honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), wild social and solitary bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea), and flower-visiting flies (Diptera). Our objectives were to describe the pollinator community in soybean fields, determine which sampling method is most appropriate for characterizing their abundance and diversity, and gain insight into which pollinator taxa may contact soybean pollen. We compared modified pan traps (i.e., bee bowls), yellow sticky traps, and sweep nets for trapping pollinators in Iowa soybean fields when soybeans were blooming (i.e., reproductive stages R1-R6) during 2011 and 2012. When all trap type captures were combined, we collected 5,368 individuals and at least 50 species. Per trap type, the most pollinators were captured in bee bowls (3,644 individuals, 44 species), yellow sticky traps (1,652 individuals, 32 species), and sweep nets (66 individuals, 10 species). The most abundant species collected include Agapostemon virescens F. and Lasioglossum (Dialictus) species (Hymenoptera: Halictidae), Melissodes bimaculata Lepeletier (Hymenoptera: Apidae), and Toxomerus marginatus Say (Diptera: Syrphidae). To determine if these pollinators were foraging on soybean flowers, we looked for soybean pollen on the most abundant bee species collected that had visible pollen loads. We found soybean pollen alone or intermixed with pollen grains from other plant species on 29 and 38% of the bees examined in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Our data suggest a diverse community of pollinators-composed of mostly native, solitary bees-visit soybean fields and forage on their flowers within Iowa.	[Gill, K.

In this study, the behavior and pollination efficiency of Apis mellifera L. and two species of stingless bees, Plebeia emerina Friese and Tetragonisca fiebrigi Schwarz, were evaluated and compared in flowers of Brassica napus L. 'Hyola 61'. A. mellifera was an efficient pollinator when collecting nectar because it effectively touched the reproductive organs of the flower. In contrast, stingless bees were efficient pollinators only when collecting pollen. The number of pollen grains deposited on the stigma after a single visit by worker bees of the three species was greater than the number of grains resulting from pollination without the bee visits. On average, the three species deposited enough pollen grains to fertilize all of the flower ovules. A. mellifera and P. emerina had similar pollination efficiency because no significant differences were observed in the characteristics of the siliques produced. Although T. fiebrigi is also an effective pollinator, the seed mass produced by their pollination was lower. Native bees promoted similar rates of fruit set compared with A. mellifera. Thus, P. emerina has potential to be used for pollination in canola crops.

As green roofs become more common in cities, an understanding of the potential positive and negative impacts of widespread use of this exotic but useful plant is needed. In this study we sampled bees visiting a green roof in downtown Toronto and compared the proportion of Sedum pollen in the loads they were carrying back to nesting locations. It was found that smaller bees (e.g. Lasioglossum, Hylaeus) were significantly less common on the roof compared with medium (e.g. Apis, Megachile) and large-sized bees (e.g. Bombus, Andrena). The proportion of Sedum pollen in the pollen loads of foraging bees collected was high amongst all bees (average of 80.5 % of total pollen load), but significantly greater for exotic bees compared to native bees. Moreover, native bees had significantly greater numbers of non-Sedum pollen types comprising more than > 20 % of their pollen loads, meaning bees could be visiting flowers at ground level and on the roof in the same foraging bout. As the number of green roofs in cities increase, the characteristics of their designs, including the vegetation type and diversity, could have a significant impact in shaping local urban bee communities.

For these reasons, in Italy, a project between the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Perugia (currently DSA3) and Syngenta Crop Protection S.p.a. (currently Syngenta Italia S.p.a.) started in order to verify if the presence of autochtonous vegetation could be not only attractive for the pollinating insects but also fit for safeguarding the useful insects and increasing their populations. This study indicates that it is practical for growers to create valuable habitats suitable for natural pollinators. Moreover, it is possible to significantly reduce soil erosion and protect the water resources from pollution through a careful planning and management. Based on 5-years results in Italy and others European Countries, actually "Operation Pollinator" is applied in 13 European Countries besides Swizerland, UK and USA with the aim to safeguard native pollinating insects and honeybees. Our study, connected to the "Operation Pollinator", can be considered as forerunner of the Greening Measures within the new EU Common Agricultural Policy (2014-2020).

The honey bee decline, in particular, appears to result from the combination of multiple stresses, including diseases, pathogens, and pesticides. The reduction of semi-natural habitats is also suspected to entail floral resource scarcity for bees. Yet, the seasonal dynamics and composition of the honey bee diet remains poorly documented to date. In this study, we studied the seasonal contribution of mass-flowering crops (rapeseed and sunflower) vs. other floral resources, as well as the influence of nutritional quality and landscape composition on pollen diet composition over five consecutive years. From April to October, the mass of pollen and nectar collected by honey bees followed a bimodal seasonal trend, marked by a two-month period of low food supply between the two oilseed crop mass-flowerings (ending in May for rapeseed and July for sunflower). Bees collected nectar mainly from crops while pollen came from a wide diversity of herbaceous and woody plant species in semi-natural habitats or from weeds in crops. Weed species constituted the bulk of the honey bee diet between the mass flowering crop periods (up to 40%) and are therefore suspected to play a critical role at this time period. The pollen diet composition was related to the nutritional value of the collected pollen and by the local landscape composition. Our study highlights (1) a food supply depletion period of both pollen and nectar resources during late spring, contemporaneously with the demographic peak of honey bee populations, (2) a high botanical richness of pollen diet, mostly proceeding from trees and weeds, and (3) a pollen diet composition influenced by the local landscape composition. Our results therefore support the Agri-Environmental Schemes intended to promote honey bees and beekeeping sustainability through the enhancement of flower availability in agricultural landscapes.

Colonies of Bumble Bees ( Bombus impatiens) Produce Fewer Workers, Less Bee Biomass, and Have Smaller Mother Queens Following Fungicide Exposure	INSECTS			English	Article						chlorothalonil; bee decline; native bees	OSMIA-LIGNARIA HYMENOPTERA; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEE; NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDE; MEGACHILE-ROTUNDATA; TERRESTRIS; TOXICITY; POLLINATORS; DECLINE; POLLEN	Bees provide vital pollination services to the majority of flowering plants in both natural and agricultural systems. Unfortunately, both native and managed bee populations are experiencing declines, threatening the persistence of these plants and crops. Agricultural chemicals are one possible culprit contributing to bee declines. Even fungicides, generally considered safe for bees, have been shown to disrupt honey bee development and impair bumble bee behavior. Little is known, however, how fungicides may affect bumble bee colony growth. We conducted a controlled cage study to determine the effects of fungicide exposure on colonies of a native bumble bee species (Bombus impatiens). Colonies of B. impatiens were exposed to flowers treated with field-relevant levels of the fungicide chlorothalonil over the course of one month. Colony success was assessed by the number and biomass of larvae, pupae, and adult bumble bees. Bumble bee colonies exposed to fungicide produced fewer workers, lower total bee biomass, and had lighter mother queens than control colonies. Our results suggest that fungicides negatively affect the colony success of a native bumble bee species and that the use of fungicides during bloom has the potential to severely impact the success of native bumble bee populations foraging in agroecosystems.

However, the effects of invasive species on local communities have rarely been addressed in the light of secondary succession. Therefore, we studied the impact of the highly invasive Solidago canadensis on plant and pollinator communities along a gradient of invasion severity in old fields with different ages (1-20 years since last ploughing) in Southern Transylvania, Romania. We asked whether the invasion of S. canadensis causes shifts in (1) the composition and diversity of plant communities, and (2) pollinator communities along the successional gradient. Further, we asked (3) to what extent the presence of S. canadensis affected flower visitation of native plant species by pollinators. According to our results, the invasion reduced the native plant species richness throughout succession, although the most profound negative effect on plant diversity and vegetation naturalness was exerted in older successional communities. The invasion of S. canadensis had a negative effect on the abundance of bees irrespective of the old field age; however, there was no similar negative effect on hoverflies. Native flowers experienced reduced visitation by wild bees, honey bees and hoverflies due to the augmented presence of S. canadensis. Therefore, the invasion of this perennial plant species diverts the trajectory of vegetation succession, alters the mutualistic links between the native elements of these old fields, and causes a non-desired alternative stable states to be installed.

Seed coating with a neonicotinoid insecticide negatively affects wild bees	NATURE			English	Article							BOMBUS-IMPATIENS HYMENOPTERA; COMBINED PESTICIDE; TREATED CANOLA; COLONY HEALTH; POLLINATORS; EXPOSURE; CLOTHIANIDIN; MEGACHILIDAE; TRAITS; IMPACT	Understanding the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on bees is vital because of reported declines in bee diversity and distribution(1-3) and the crucial role bees have as pollinators in ecosystems and agriculture(4). Neonicotinoids are suspected to pose an unacceptable risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in plants(5), and the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees(6). The moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence(7), particularly because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have been artificially fed neonicotinoids(8-11). Thus, the key question is how neonicotinoids influence bees, and wild bees in particular, in real-world agricultural landscapes(11-13). Here we show that a commonly used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched landscapes, we found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide containing a combination of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the non-systemic pyrethroid beta-cyfluthrin, applied to oilseed rape seeds, reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such insecticidal use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural landscapes, and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild bees(1-3) may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant response in honeybee colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects on honeybees cannot always be extrapolated to wild bees.	[Rundlof, Maj; Andersson, Georg K.

Pollination services provided by wild insects to kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa)	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						activity patterns; foraging behavior; pollination efficiency; pollinator complementarity; weather effect	APIS-MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA; HONEY-BEES; FRUIT-SET; APPLE ORCHARDS; OSMIA-CORNUTA; APIDAE; MEGACHILIDAE; CROPS; PERFORMANCE; LANDSCAPES	Managed bees are used to transfer pollen from male to female flowers in kiwifruit, but the contribution of wild insects has been long overlooked. We approached such contribution with multiple criteria (pollinator abundance, foraging behavior, pollinating efficiency, and response to weather conditions) in the absence of imported colonies. An abundant and rich community of pollinators (57 % were non-Apis insects) visited kiwifruit flowers and assured a fruit set and size not different from those obtained by optimal hand pollination. Honeybees were more abundant and visited more flowers per time but bumblebees were more efficient on a per-visit basis. Other taxa are expected to contribute less because of their lower numbers (hoverflies, wild bees, butterflies, beetles) or their passive behavior (non-syrphid flies). Visitation patterns of pollinators were complementary. Our results highlight the important contribution of wild insects to the pollination of kiwifruit.

We monitored wild bees in oilseed rape fields in 16 landscapes in Germany in two consecutive years. Effects on bee densities of landscape oilseed rape cover in the years of monitoring and in the previous years were evaluated with landscape data from three consecutive years. We fit empirical data to a mechanistic model to provide estimates for oilseed rape attractiveness and its effect on bee productivity in comparison to the rest of the landscape, and we evaluated consequences for pollinator densities in consecutive years. Our results show that high oilseed rape cover in the previous year enhances current densities of wild bees (except for bumble bees). Moreover, we show a strong attractiveness of and dilution on (i.e., decreasing bee densities with increasing landscape oilseed rape cover) oilseed rape for bees during flowering in the current year, modifying the effect of the previous year's oilseed rape cover in the case ofwild bees (excluding Bombus). As long as other factors such as nesting sites or natural enemies do not limit bee reproduction, our findings suggest long-term positive effects of mass-flowering crops on bee populations, at least for non-Bombus generalists, which possibly help to maintain crop pollination services even when crop area increases. Similar effects are conceivable for other organisms providing ecosystem services in annual crops and should be considered in future studies.

A sting in the spit: widespread cross-infection of multiple RNA viruses across wild and managed bees	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Apis; Bombus; decline; pathogen; spillover	DEFORMED-WING-VIRUS; BUMBLE BEES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; PARALYSIS VIRUS; APIS-MELLIFERA; VIRAL PATHOGEN; DECLINE; TRANSMISSION; CONSERVATION; POLLINATORS	Declining populations of bee pollinators are a cause of concern, with major repercussions for biodiversity loss and food security. RNA viruses associated with honeybees represent a potential threat to other insect pollinators, but the extent of this threat is poorly understood. This study aims to attain a detailed understanding of the current and ongoing risk of emerging infectious disease (EID) transmission between managed and wild pollinator species across a wide range of RNA viruses. Within a structured large-scale national survey across 26 independent sites, we quantify the prevalence and pathogen loads of multiple RNA viruses in co-occurring managed honeybee (Apis mellifera) and wild bumblebee (Bombus spp.) populations. We then construct models that compare virus prevalence between wild and managed pollinators. Multiple RNA viruses associated with honeybees are widespread in sympatric wild bumblebee populations. Virus prevalence in honeybees is a significant predictor of virus prevalence in bumblebees, but we remain cautious in speculating over the principle direction of pathogen transmission. We demonstrate species-specific differences in prevalence, indicating significant variation in disease susceptibility or tolerance. Pathogen loads within individual bumblebees may be high and in the case of at least one RNA virus, prevalence is higher in wild bumblebees than in managed honeybee populations. Our findings indicate widespread transmission of RNA viruses between managed and wild bee pollinators, pointing to an interconnected network of potential disease pressures within and among pollinator species. In the context of the biodiversity crisis, our study emphasizes the importance of targeting a wide range of pathogens and defining host associations when considering potential drivers of population decline.

Despite this risk, honeybees and other sequenced social insects have far fewer canonical immune genes relative to solitary insects. Social protection from infection, including behavioral responses, may explain this depauperate immune repertoire. Here, based on full genome sequences, we describe the immune repertoire of two ecologically and commercially important bumblebee species that diverged approximately 18 million years ago, the North American Bombus impatiens and European Bombus terrestris. Results: We find that the immune systems of these bumblebees, two species of honeybee, and a solitary leafcutting bee, are strikingly similar. Transcriptional assays confirm the expression of many of these genes in an immunological context and more strongly in young queens than males, affirming Bateman's principle of greater investment in female immunity. We find evidence of positive selection in genes encoding antiviral responses, components of the Toll and JAK/STAT pathways, and serine protease inhibitors in both social and solitary bees. Finally, we detect many genes across pathways that differ in selection between bumblebees and honeybees, or between the social and solitary clades. Conclusions: The similarity in immune complement across a gradient of sociality suggests that a reduced immune repertoire predates the evolution of sociality in bees. The differences in selection on immune genes likely reflect divergent pressures exerted by parasites across social contexts.

The Cerrado biome covers approximately 23% of Brazil and is one of the world's most important agricultural frontiers. Here, we conducted field experiments in the Brazilian Cerrado to evaluate the diversity of bees, their foraging behaviors and flower visiting periods, and their potential contribution to the performance of six melon (Cucumis melo L.) cultivars. Five bee species (Apis mellifera, Halictus sp., Plebeia sp., Trigona pallens, and T. spinipes) were recorded visiting both male and hermaphrodite flower types of all C melo cultivars. Whereas A. mellifera showed two peaks of flower visitation (an intense first one between 8:00 a.m. and 11 :00 a.m. and a second less intense one after 4:00 p.m.), all other bee species visited the C melo flowers only in the morning, with intensities and visitation peaks similar to those of A. mellifera. All of these bees collected nectar and pollen. Our results also indicated a moderate correlation between the intensity of bee visitation and fruit weight, demonstrating that all of these bees had the potential to pollinate C. melo and to influence its productivity. Except for the cultivar 'Hibrix', all the other cultivars showed economic feasibility and produced fruits of marketable sizes, with an estimated yield (over 25 tons/ha) in the range registered in other Brazilian regions.

J	Wolff, LF; Gomes, JCC				Wolff, Luis Fernando; Costa Gomes, Joao Carlos			Beekeeping and Agroecological Systems for Endogenous Sustainable Development	AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						family farming; indigenous people; agrarian reform; quilombolas; stingless bees; Africanized honeybee		This article examines the process of agroecological research on beekeeping systems, developed jointly by the Temperate Agriculture Program of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Company (EMBRAPA), and the Institute of Sociology and Peasant Studies (ISEC), of the University of Cordoba. The investigation was carried out on different beekeeping experiences in southern Brazil: peasant family farms, settlements of agrarian reform, and Afro-descent quilombola and Guarani indigenous villages. The systems are managed in the contexts of agroecological farming and include "Africanized honeybees" and native "stingless bees," integrated among trees and crops. We show that the dynamics of investigation that follows the guidelines presented by family farmers and traditional people contribute to their empowerment and to changing their own reality, favoring endogenous development and the dialogue of knowledge. The participatory experiences by ISEC and EMBRAPA Temperate Agriculture through the organization and mobilization of farmers and traditional people generated organizational structures that build local food systems. This joint initiative contributes to peasants' search for autonomy and food sovereignty, and strengthens the reproduction of this work toward the political dimension of agroecology.

Here, we report the first-ever detection of the fungus in adult bumble bees that were raised in captivity for studies on colony development. Wild queens of Bombus griseocollis, B. nevadensis and B. vosnesenskii were collected and maintained for establishment of nests. Queens that died during rearing or that did not lay eggs within one month of capture were dissected, and tissues were examined microscopically for the presence of pathogens. Filamentous fungi that were detected were plated on artificial media containing broad spectrum antibiotics for isolation and identification. Based on morphological characters, the fungus was identified as Ascosphaera apis (Maasen ex Claussen) Olive and Spiltoir, a species that has been reported earlier only from larvae of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, the Asian honey bee, Apis cerana, and the carpenter bee Xylocopa californica arizonensis. The identity of the fungus was confirmed using molecular markers and phylogenetic analysis. Ascosphaera apis was detected in queens of all three bumble bee species examined. Of 150 queens dissected, 12 (8%) contained vegetative and reproductive stages of the fungus. Both fungal stages were also detected in two workers collected from colonies with Ascosphaera-infected B. nevadensis queens. In this study, wild bees could have been infected prior to capture for rearing, or, the A. apis infection could have originated via contaminated European honey bee pollen fed to the bumble bees in captivity. Thus, the discovery of A. apis in adult bumble bees in the current study has important implications for commercial production of bumble bee colonies and highlights potential risks to native bees via pathogen spillover from infected bees and infected pollen.

(Rubiaceae) mediated by Apis mellifera (Apidae) and species of Augochloropsis (Halictidae)	ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA			English	Article						Bee pollination; heterostyly; honeybees; pollination effectiveness; reproductive success	POLLINATION NETWORKS; INTRODUCED BEES; CLOUD FOREST; HONEY-BEE; PLANT; MORPHOLOGY; EFFICIENCY; BUMBLEBEE; FREQUENCY; IMPACTS	Heterostyly is a floral polymorphism consisting in the presence of two morphs in the population that differ reciprocally in the position of their sexual organs. Heterostylous species depend on visitors to produce fruits, but the efficiency of insect species as pollinators greatly varies and depends on the morph visited. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a single visit by the bees Apis mellifera and species of Augochloropsis on the fruit set of the distylous species Psychotria carthagenensis. After a single visit from each bee species, flowers were bagged to monitor the fruit set. Pollination effectiveness between pollinators and morphs was compared. The results of the experiments were compared with data from manual intermorph cross-pollination using the G test. There were no significant differences in the fruit set between treatments (insect visit and cross-pollination), and between flowers visited by Augochloropsis spp. and flowers visited by A. mellifera. Our results suggest that pollination effectiveness of the studied bees was not related to floral morph, and that both exotic and native bees showed similar performances on the fruit set of P. carthagenensis.

J	Jongjitvimol, T; Petchsri, S				Jongjitvimol, Touchkanin; Petchsri, Sahanat			Native Bee Pollinators and Pollen Sources of Apidae (Hymenoptera) in Four Forest Types of Lower Northern Thailand	SAINS MALAYSIANA			English	Article						Biodiversity; native bees; seasonal forests; Thailand; vegetation	DIVERSITY	Bee species diversity and pollen sources of Apidae (Hymenoptera) in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, lower northern Thailand, were studied from 2011 to 2012. The forest types encountered were deciduous dipterocarp, deciduous with bamboo, seasonal evergreen and dipterocarp - pine forests. Sweep nets and honey bait traps were used to collect bee samples. The beta diversity of native bees was high with 22 recorded insect species from 12 genera and pollen grains collected by native bees were 62 plant species from 28 families. The plant family Fabaceae (Leguminosae) contained the greatest number of species (9 species). The main pollen source of native bees was Hopea odorata Roxb. (Dipterocarpaceae) which was collected by 19 bee species. The result from biodiversity indices i.e. species diversity (H'), species evenness (J'), similarity habitat (Ss) and species richness (D) indicated that this area has relatively high species diversity. In addition, the dwarf honey bees, Apis florea Fabricius, 1787, are the main pollinator at the study site with the highest number of pollinated plant species (46 species). Thus, this bee could be used as a biological indicator for future studies.

In this study, we investigated (1) pollinator nest distributions and estimated colony abundances, (2) the relationship between abundances of foraging workers and the number of nests they represent, (3) pollinator foraging ranges, and (4) the relationship between pollinator abundance and plant reproduction. We examined these questions in an alpine ecosystem in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, focusing on four alpine bumble bee species (Bombus balteatus, B. flavifrons, B. bifarius, and B. sylvicola), and two host plants that differ in their degrees of pollinator specialization (Trifolium dasyphyllum and T. parryi). Using microsatellites, we found that estimated colony abundances among Bombus species ranged from; similar to 18 to 78 colonies/0.01 km(2). The long-tongued species B. balteatus was most common, especially high above treeline, but the subalpine species B. bifarius was unexpectedly abundant for this elevation range. Nests detected among sampled foragers of each species were correlated with the number of foragers caught. Foraging ranges were smaller than expected for all Bombus species, ranging from 25 to 110 m. Fruit set for the specialized plant, Trifolium parryi, was positively related to the abundance of its Bombus pollinator. In contrast, fruit set for the generalized plant, T. dasyphyllum, was related to abundance of all Bombus species. Because forager abundance was related to nest abundance of each Bombus species and was an equally effective predictor of plant fecundity, forager inventories are probably suitable for assessing the health of outcrossing plant populations. However, nest abundance, rather than forager abundance, better reflects demographic and genetic health in populations of eusocial pollinators such as bumble bees. Development of models incorporating the parameters we have measured here (nest abundance, forager abundance, and foraging distance) could increase the usefulness of foraging worker inventories in monitoring, managing, and conserving pollinator populations.

We conducted multi-year field and laboratory studies of the sexual system and reproductive biology of Solanum vespertilio. Flowers are tetramerous, zygomorphic, heterantherous and sometimes enantiostylous. The species is andromonoecious. Anthers are heteromorphic in both sex forms, with one long upcurved and three straight shorter anthers. The style in male flowers is short to vestigial; in hermaphrodites it is strongly up-turned, longer than the anthers. The single large anther bears 45 % of the pollen. Some of these unusual features may illustrate insular release from selection, though, given the antiquity of the Canaries; they likely constitute selection to promote effective sexual reproduction and outcrossing. Experiments with manually deflected styles showed higher fruit set than controls. The nascent expression of enantiostyly offers the opportunity for understanding its evolution. The species is weakly self-compatible, which may offer fertility insurance, or be remnant of the status of colonizers. Field observations suggest that the number of fruit developing in an inflorescence affects the gender of subsequent flowers. Thus, the strength of andromonoecy may both affect the rate of outcrossing (genetic issues), and/or constitute a mechanism for response to the level of fruit set (physiological/ecological issues). Flowers were buzz-pollinated by large-bodied native bees. Most of the unusual features of S. vespertilio presumably promote effective pollen transport and perhaps outcrossing. Effective conservation programs depend not only on protecting habitat, but also on fruit set; the latter is dependent on knowledge of pollination and reproductive biology.

Soybean crops may benefit from forest pollinators	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Habitat fragmentation; Pollinator spillover; Forest-crop interface; Soybean reproductive success	GLYCINE-MAX L.; NATURAL HABITATS; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; SERVICES; PLANTS; DISPERSAL; SPILLOVER	Increasing evidence indicates that pollinator diversity and pollination services are highly threatened by the destruction and fragmentation of natural habitats and the intensification of agricultural landscapes. Here we analyze the bee visiting ensemble on soybean flowers and the effects of pollinator visits on soybean reproductive success, within a fragmented Chaco forest landscape embedded in a soybean matrix in central Argentina. We assessed visitation rates in relation to distance from the forest (5, 50 and 100 m) compared soybean bee assemblages with those on wild flowers in the nearby forest fragments, and carried out an exclosure experiment in order to assess the contribution of insect visits to soybean reproductive success. We also analyzed the relationship between visitor body size and the distance from the forest to the visited flower. Five species belonging to two families of bees were observed visiting soybean flowers. The bee species observed on soybean were well represented in the forest, and Apis mellifera was the most abundant species, visiting soybean flowers at all studied distances from the forest. Instead, wild visitors displayed a turnover of species throughout those distances, with smaller species being restricted to the forest proximity and replaced by larger ones toward the interior of the crop. Total visitation rates were significantly and negatively affected by distance to the forest. All plant productivity variables measured in the exclosure experiments were significantly improved in exposed flowers, duplicating the values observed without pollinators. The present study offers preliminary evidence linking forest proximity to higher visitation rates and presence of wild pollinators on soybean flowers thus providing for the first time, evidence of the forest role as pollinator donor for the soybean crop. It also shows that pollinator activity matters for this crop, leading to increased soybean yield. Further research on this topic is necessary in order to provide informed guidelines to enhance soybean production while simultaneously promoting natural habitat conservation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Sown flower strips in southern Sweden increase abundances of wild bees and hoverflies in the wider landscape	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Agro-ecosystem; Attraction effect; Distance decay; Habitat quality; Landscape heterogeneity	FARMING PRACTICE; FORAGING RANGES; LAND-USE; DIVERSITY; POLLINATORS; HETEROGENEITY; AVAILABILITY; CONSERVATION; REPRODUCTION; HYMENOPTERA	Pollinator populations have suffered severe declines in many industrialised countries due to reduced floral and nesting resources, brought on by agricultural intensification. One potential method of mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees. Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes, and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland.

J	Pisanty, G; Mandelik, Y				Pisanty, Gideon; Mandelik, Yael			Profiling crop pollinators: life history traits predict habitat use and crop visitation by Mediterranean wild bees	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						crop pollination; ecosystem service; ecotone; edge effect; functional trait; habitat gradient; Halictini; land use change; Lasioglossum; life-history trait; Mediterranean agroecosystem; wild bees	NATIVE BEES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; NATURAL HABITAT; LANDSCAPES; SPECIALIZATION; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; INSECTS; FOREST	Wild pollinators, bees in particular, may greatly contribute to crop pollination and provide a safety net against declines in commercial pollinators. However, the identity, life history traits, and environmental sensitivities of main crop pollinator species have received limited attention. These are crucial for predicting pollination services of different communities and for developing management practices that enhance crop pollinators. We sampled wild bees in three crop systems (almond, confection sunflower, and seed watermelon) in a mosaic Israeli Mediterranean landscape. Bees were sampled in field/orchard edges and interiors, and in seminatural scrub surrounding the fields/orchards. We also analyzed land cover at 50-2500 m radii around fields/orchards. We used this data to distinguish crop from non-crop pollinators based on a set of life history traits (nesting, lecty, sociality, body size) linked to habitat preference and crop visitation. Bee abundance and species richness decreased from the surrounding seminatural habitat to the field/orchard interior, especially across the seminatural habitat-field edge ecotone. Thus, although rich bee communities were found near fields, only small fractions crossed the ecotone and visited crop flowers in substantial numbers. The bee assemblage in agricultural fields/orchards and on crop flowers was dominated by ground-nesting bees of the tribe Halictini, which tend to nest within fields. Bees' habitat preferences were determined mainly by nesting guild, whereas crop visitation was determined mainly by sociality. Lecty and body size also affected both measures. The percentage of surrounding seminatural habitat at 250-2500 m radii had a positive effect on wild bee diversity in field edges, for all bee guilds, while at 50-100 m radii, only aboveground nesters were positively affected. In sum, we found that crop and non-crop pollinators are distinguished by behavioral and morphological traits. Hence, analysis of life-history traits of bee communities can help assess the pollination services they are likely to provide (when taking into account single-visit pollination efficiency). The ecotone between agricultural fields and surrounding habitats is a major barrier that filters many bee species, particularly with regard to their nesting requirements. Thus, greater attention should be given to management practices that encourage pollinators to live and nest, and not only forage, within fields.

J	Mallinger, RE; Gratton, C				Mallinger, Rachel E.; Gratton, Claudio			Species richness of wild bees, but not the use of managed honeybees, increases fruit set of a pollinator-dependent crop	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Agroecosystems; Apis mellifera; apple; bee conservation; diversity-function; functional complementarity; native bee; orchards; pollination; yield	APPLE ORCHARDS; NATIVE BEES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; POLLEN; HYMENOPTERA; LANDSCAPES; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; DECLINE; LOSSES	1. Native, wild bees are important pollinators for both crop and wild plants. With concerns over the availability and cost of managed honeybees, attention has turned to native, wild bees as crop pollinators. However, the ability of native, wild bees to provide sufficient pollination may depend on their populations at local scales. 2. Therefore, at the farm scale, we examined the pollination contribution of both native, wild bees and managed honeybees to apples and assessed the relative importance of bee abundance vs. species richness. Over three growing seasons, apple fruit set, bee abundance and bee species richness were measured at orchards in Wisconsin, half of which used managed honeybees, thus allowing us to independently examine the contribution of native, wild bees to fruit set. We additionally conducted observations of honeybees and wild bees foraging on apple blossoms in order to examine functional complementarity. 3. We found that apples are highly dependent on animal pollinators. However, fruit set was not significantly higher at orchards with managed honeybees, nor did it increase with the number of honeybees per orchard. Instead, fruit set significantly increased with the species richness of native, wild bees during bloom. 4. Honeybees and wild bees showed different foraging preferences: honeybees more frequently visited apple flowers on densely blooming trees, while wild bees showed no preference for floral density, thereby evenly visiting trees throughout the orchard. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that native, wild bees play a significant and unique role in apple pollination within our region and cannot therefore be replaced by managed bees. Moreover, our findings suggest that bee conservation efforts should focus specifically on maintaining or increasing bee species richness in order to improve pollination and crop yields.

The potential for infectious pathogens to spillover and emerge from managed populations to wildlife communities is poorly understood, but ecological, evolutionary and anthropogenic factors are all likely to influence the initial exposure and subsequent infection, spread and impact of disease. Fast-evolving RNA viruses, known to cause severe colony losses in managed honeybee populations, deserve particular attention for their propensity to jump between host species and thus threaten ecologically and economically important wild pollinator communities. 2. We review the literature on pollinator viruses to identify biological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence, highlight gaps in the literature, and discuss potential management strategies. 3. We provide evidence that many wild pollinator species are exposed to viruses from commercial species, resulting in multiple spillover events. However, it is not clear whether species become infected as a result of spillover or whether transmission is occurring within these wild populations. Ecological traits of pollinating insects, such as overlapping ranges, niches and behaviours, clearly promote cross-species transmission of RNA viruses. Moreover, we conclude that the social behaviour and phylogenetic relatedness of social pollinators further facilitate within-and between-host transmission, leaving these species particularly vulnerable to emerging diseases. 4. We argue that the commercial use of pollinators is a key driver of disease emergence in these beneficial insects and that this must be addressed by management and policy. 5. Synthesis and applications. There are important knowledge gaps, ranging from disease distribution and prevalence, to pathogen life history and virulence, to the impacts of disease emergence, which need to be addressed as research priorities. It is clear that avoiding anthropogenic pathogen spillover is crucial to preventing and managing disease emergence in pollinators, with far-reaching effects on our food security, ecosystem services and biodiversity. We argue that it is crucial to prevent the introduction of diseased pollinators into natural environments, which can be achieved through improved monitoring and management practices.

J	Hanes, SP; Collum, KK; Hoshide, AK; Asare, E				Hanes, Samuel P.; Collum, Kourtney K.; Hoshide, Aaron K.; Asare, Eric			Grower perceptions of native pollinators and pollination strategies in the lowbush blueberry industry	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						pollination; perceptions of pollinators; agricultural diversity; Maine agriculture; blueberries	SERVICES; CONSERVATION; HYMENOPTERA; TRENDS; CROP; BEES	Pollinator declines and dependence on insect pollination, particularly in fruit and vegetable crops, creates a pressing need to understand growers' interactions with pollinators and factors affecting pollination strategies. At present, many growers are dependent on commercial honey bees (Apis mellifera), but diversified strategies may be necessary to secure adequate crop pollination in the future. As of yet, little social science research exists on pollination practices. This article presents the results of a survey of lowbush blueberry growers in Maine. The survey was part of a five-year pollination security study focusing on four fruit and vegetables crops in the Northeast US. The survey assesses grower perceptions of native pollinators' effectiveness and their perceptions of native pollinators' contribution to fruit set. Results indicate a widespread perception among growers of native pollinators' importance. While native pollinators are not effective enough to replace rented honey bees for three-quarters of the industry, they are broadly seen as an important form of insurance in poor weather when honey bees' effectiveness is reduced. The main obstacle to greater utilization of native pollinators found in this study was uncertainty over native pollinators' contribution to yield and the associated difficulty monitoring native pollinators' population size. Scientists and extension experts must work to reduce these obstacles before more widespread use of native pollinators will occur.

Spinosad in the native stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata: Regrettable non-target toxicity of a bioinsecticide	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Spinosyns; Neonicotinoids; Native pollinators; Sublethal impact; Behavior; Group activity	MEGACHILE-ROTUNDATA; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; INSECTICIDES; PESTICIDE; POLLINATION; RISK; NEONICOTINOIDS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; CONSERVATION; METAANALYSIS	The risks imposed by novel insecticides, mainly bioinsecticides, are largely unknown despite their increased use and their perceived environmental safety, which is based on their natural origin. Furthermore, unlike honeybees, native pollinator species have received little attention. In the present study, the lethal and sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the bioinsecticide spinosad were assessed in the stingless bee species Melipona quadrifasciata, an important native pollinator in the Neotropical region. The adult stingless bee workers exhibited high oral insecticide susceptibility, with LD(50)s of 23.54 and 12.07 ng a.i./bee for imidacloprid and spinosad, respectively. Imidacloprid also impaired worker respiration and overall group activity and flight, while spinosad significantly impaired only worker flight despite exhibiting higher oral toxicity to adult workers than imidacloprid. These findings indicate the hazardous nature not only of imidacloprid but also the bioinsecticide spinosad to adult workers of the native pollinator M. quadrifasciata. Therefore, bioinsecticides should not be exempted from risk assessment analysis due to their lethal and sublethal components. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bee declines driven by combined stress from parasites, pesticides, and lack of flowers	SCIENCE			English	Review							NOSEMA-CERANAE MICROSPORIDIA; PROVIDING FORAGING RESOURCES; BUMBLEBEE NEST DENSITY; WESTERN HONEY-BEE; APIS-MELLIFERA L; POLLINATION SERVICES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; PATHOGEN SPILLOVER; NATIVE BUMBLEBEES	Bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined; bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example, pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, and studying these interactions experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted. Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies into the future.

J	MacIvor, JS; Packer, L				MacIvor, J. Scott; Packer, Laurence			'Bee Hotels' as Tools for Native Pollinator Conservation: A Premature Verdict?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEGACHILE-ROTUNDATA; LEAFCUTTING BEE; NESTING BEES; HYMENOPTERA; SCALE; PARASITISM; DIVERSITY; RICHNESS; DECLINES; BRITAIN	Society is increasingly concerned with declining wild bee populations. Although most bees nest in the ground, considerable effort has centered on installing 'bee hotels'-also known as nest boxes or trap nests-which artificially aggregate nest sites of above ground nesting bees. Campaigns to 'save the bees' often promote these devices despite the absence of data indicating they have a positive effect. From a survey of almost 600 bee hotels set up over a period of three years in Toronto, Canada, introduced bees nested at 32.9% of sites and represented 24.6% of more than 27,000 total bees and wasps recorded (47.1% of all bees recorded). Native bees were parasitized more than introduced bees and females of introduced bee species provisioned nests with significantly more female larva each year. Native wasps were significantly more abundant than both native and introduced bees and occupied almost 3/4 of all bee hotels each year; further, introduced wasps were the only group to significantly increase in relative abundance year over year. More research is needed to elucidate the potential pitfalls and benefits of using bee hotels in the conservation and population dynamics of wild native bees.	[MacIvor, J.

J	Jakobsson, A; Padron, B; Agren, J				Jakobsson, Anna; Padron, Benigno; Agren, Jon			Distance-dependent effects of invasive Lupinus polyphyllus on pollination and reproductive success of two native herbs	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Fecundity; Invasion; Lotus corniculatus; Lychnis viscaria; Pollination; Spatial scale	ALIEN PLANT; PURPLE LOOSESTRIFE; CARPOBROTUS SPP.; SEED SET; VISITATION; COMMUNITIES; COMPETITION; POLLEN; MUTUALISMS; DIVERSITY	A comprehensive understanding of the effects of invasive plants on native species requires identification of both the mechanisms of interaction and the spatial scale over which they act. Indirect interactions involving mobile organisms such as pollinators are likely to be scale-dependent, yet most studies examining effects of invasive species on pollination of native plants have considered effects across a single distance between interacting species. We examined the effects of the invasive herb Lupinus polyphyllus on pollination of two native herbs using multiple distances between the invasive and the natives. We recorded pollinator visitation and seed production in the native herbs Lotus corniculatus and Lychnis viscaria at 0, 5 m or 200 m away from L. polyphyllus. To reduce the influence of confounding factors, we used experimentally established populations of the invasive and potted individuals of the natives. In the immediate vicinity to L. polyphyllus, visitation to L. corniculatus was higher than 200 m away, and seed production per flower was higher than 5 m and 200 m away. In L. viscaria, bumblebee visitation was higher adjacent to L. polyphyllus than 5 m and 200 m away, but total pollinator visitation and reproductive success did not vary with distance. The results indicate that L. polyphyllus facilitates pollination of the native plants, and that this occurs at a very local spatial scale as effects dropped off already at a distance of 5 m. Presence of L. polyphyllus could benefit both pollinators and pollination of native herbs, and these positive effects should be considered along with likely negative effects due to resource competition. Moreover, the results illustrate the necessity to consider scale-dependent effects when assessing the impact of invasive flowering plants on native pollination interactions.

We tested an integrated pest management push-pull protocol in the Atlantic Forest in SAo Paulo, Brazil, in an effort to prevent bee swarms from colonizing nest boxes (N = 30 in the forest plus five in aviaries) meant for use by Vinaceous-breasted Amazons (Amazona vinacea). Fifteen parrot nest boxes were treated with a permethrin insecticide to push scout bees away and each parrot box was paired with a bee trap box containing a pheromone lure to pull bees. Over a 1-yr period (March 2013 to March 2014), 29 insect colonies moved into 18 of the 35 trap boxes. Nine Africanized honey bee, three native Jatai bee (Tetragonisca sp.), and 17 wasp colonies occupied trap boxes. Only one experimental push-pull pair untreated parrot box was invaded by bees and no parrot boxes in aviaries were colonized. Four of the parrot nest boxes were occupied by birds during our study. Although none were used by Vinaceous-breasted Amazons, Southern House Wrens (Troglodytes musculus), Green-winged Saltators (Saltator similis), and Plain Parakeets (Brotogeris tirica) nested in the boxes and all nests were successful. Although long-term studies are needed before drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of trap boxes, our results suggest that a push-pull protocol may prove useful for reducing the use of nest boxes meant for parrots and other cavity-nesting birds by Africanized honey bees and other insects. RESUMEN Un esquema integrada de alejar-atraer para el control de plagas para la prevencion del uso de cajas nido para loros por las abejas de miel Africanizadas invasoras Las abejas de miel Africanizadas (Apis mellifera scutellata) compiten con los loros en peligro de extincion para las cajas nido y puede impedir los esfuerzos de conservacion. Probamos un metodo integrado para el control de plagas, el protocolo de alejar-atraer, en el Bosque Atlantico, en SAo Paulo, Brasil, en un esfuerzo para evitar que los enjambres de abejas colonicen las cajas nido (N = 30 en el bosque, mas cinco en aviarios) destinadas a ser utilizadas por el loro Amazona Vinosa (Amazona vinacea). Quince cajas nido fueron tratados con una insecticida permetrina para alejar las abejas exploradoras de las cajas nido. Las cajas nido tambien fueron emparejada con una caja trampa para abejas, que contenia una feromona para atraer las abejas. Durante un periodo de un ano (marzo 2013 - marzo 2014), 29 colonias de insectos se trasladaron a 18 de las 35 cajas trampa para abejas. Nueve colonias abejas de miel Africanizada, tres colonias abejas nativo Jatai (Tetragonisca sp.) y 17 colonias de avispas ocuparon las cajas trampas. Solo un experimento caja nido, emparejada con el metodo alejar-atraer, fue invadida por las abejas y ninguna de las cajas nido en aviarios fueron colonizados por abejas. Cuatro de las cajas nido estaban ocupados por aves durante nuestro estudio. Aunque ninguno fue utilizado por el loro Amazona Vinosa, los nidos fueron anidados por el Chivirin Raton (Troglodytes musculus), el Pepitero Verdoso (Saltator similis) y la Catita Tirica (Brotogeris tirica) y todos los nidos fueron exitosos. Aunque se necesitan estudios a largo plazo antes de sacar conclusiones acerca de la efectividad de la caja trampa para abejas, nuestros resultados sugieren que un protocolo de alejar-atraer puede ser util para reducir el uso de nidos de loros, y otras aves, por las abejas de miel africanizadas y otros insectos.

J	Chateil, C; Porcher, E				Chateil, Carole; Porcher, Emmanuelle			Landscape features are a better correlate of wild plant pollination than agricultural practices in an intensive cropping system	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Lotus corniculatus L.; Fruit set; Bumblebees; Organic farming; Semi-natural habitats	LAND-USE; BEE POLLINATORS; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; SERVICES; SCALE; VISITATION; DECLINES; DISTANCE	Organic farming is commonly associated with increased pollinator diversity and abundance, but the net effects on pollination rates are less documented. Besides, organic farms are often surrounded by more diverse landscapes than conventional farms, such that the contributions of landscape diversity vs. farming practices to pollination rates are often confounded with each other. Here, the roles of local vs. landscape scale variables on pollination rates of experimental plants are examined in agricultural landscapes. To this end, fruit set and seed production were measured in the obligate insect-pollinated Lotus corniculatus. Plants were located in pairs of neighboring organic vs. conventional farms, which were characterized by contrasting landscape structures and compositions. Fruit set, a proxy for pollinator visitation rates, was significantly related to landscape variables: fruit set was higher in farms close to a patch of semi-natural habitat, but lower in landscapes with a high cover of semi-natural habitats. Fruit set also correlated with local variables, such as habitat type, but not with farming type. Identical pollination rates in conventional and organic farms are likely due to similar diversities of habitats, crops and weeds in both farming types of the study area. These results therefore confirm that habitat diversity prevails over pesticide-free practices to explain the higher pollinator abundances usually observed in organic vs. conventional farms.

J	Jha, S				Jha, S.			Contemporary human-altered landscapes and oceanic barriers reduce bumble bee gene flow	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Review						Bombus; dispersal; landscape genetics; microsatellites; pollinator	CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; LAND-USE; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SIBSHIP RECONSTRUCTION; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; NEST DENSITY; HYMENOPTERA; POPULATIONS; POLLINATORS	Much of the world's terrestrial landscapes are being altered by humans in the form of agriculture, urbanization and pastoral systems, with major implications for biodiversity. Bumble bees are one of the most effective pollinators in both natural and cultivated landscapes, but are often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats. Yet, little is known about the role of natural and human-altered habitats in promoting or limiting bumble bee gene flow. In this study, I closely examine the genetic structure of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombusvosnesenskii, across the southwestern US coast and find strong evidence that natural oceanic barriers, as well as contemporary human-altered habitats, limit bee gene flow. Heterozygosity and allelic richness were lower in island populations, while private allelic richness was higher in island populations compared to mainland populations. Genetic differentiation, measured for three indices across the 1000km study region, was significantly greater than the null expectation (F-ST=0.041, F'(ST)=0.044 and D-est=0.155) and correlated with geographic distance. Furthermore, genetic differentiation patterns were most strongly correlated with contemporary (2011) not past (2006, 2001) resistance maps calibrated for high dispersal limitation over oceans, impervious habitat and croplands. Despite the incorporation of dramatic elevation gradients, the analyses reveal that oceans and contemporary human land use, not mountains, are the primary dispersal barriers for B.vosnesenskii gene flow. These findings reinforce the importance of maintaining corridors of suitable habitat across the distribution range of native pollinators to promote their persistence and safeguard their ability to provide essential pollination services.

AN ULTRAVIOLET FLORAL POLYMORPHISM ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE HISTORY DRIVES POLLINATOR DISCRIMINATION IN MIMULUS GUTTATUS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Bombus impatiens; bumblebee; ethological isolation; floral constancy; life history; nectar guide; Phrymaceae; pollination ecology; pollinator isolation; ultraviolet	FLOWER COLOR POLYMORPHISM; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; BUMBLEBEE POLLINATION; MEDIATED SELECTION; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; POPULATIONS; TRAITS; CONSTANCY; HYBRIDIZATION	Premise of the study: Ultraviolet (UV) floral patterns are common in angiosperms and mediate pollinator attraction, efficiency, and constancy. UV patterns may vary within species, yet are cryptic to human observers. Thus, few studies have explicitly described the distribution or ecological significance of intraspecific variation in UV floral patterning. Here, we describe the geographic distribution and pattern of inheritance of a UV polymorphism in the model plant species Mimulus guttatus (Phrymaceae). We then test whether naturally occurring UV phenotypes influence pollinator interactions within Mimulus guttatus. Methods: We document UV patterns in 18 annual and 19 perennial populations and test whether UV pattern is associated with life history. To examine the pattern of inheritance, we conducted crosses within and between UV phenotypes. Finally, we tested whether bee pollinators discriminate among naturally occurring UV phenotypes in two settings: wild bee communities and captive Bombus impatiens. Key results: Within Mimulus guttatus, perennial populations exhibit a small bulls-eye pattern, whereas a bilaterally symmetric runway pattern occurs mainly in annual populations. Inheritance of UV patterning is consistent with a single-locus Mendelian model in which the runway phenotype is dominant. Bee pollinators discriminate against unfamiliar UV patterns in both natural and controlled settings. Conclusions: We describe a widespread UV polymorphism associated with life history divergence within Mimulus guttatus. UV pattern influences pollinator visitation and should be considered when estimating reproductive barriers between life history ecotypes. This work develops a new system to investigate the ecology and evolution of UV floral patterning in a species with extensive genomic resources.

Crop pollinators in Brazil: a review of reported interactions	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						ecosystem services; pollination; agriculture; bees; Apoidea	HYMENOPTERA APIDAE CENTRIDINI; STINGLESS BEES; HONEY-BEE; GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS; TRIGONA-SPINIPES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOLITARY BEES; BUMBLE BEES; MELIPONINI; DECLINES	Pollinators are important to maintain ecosystem services, being part of the reproduction and seed formation process of plant species. In this study, we reviewed the literature and developed a database of interactions between pollinators and agricultural crops for Brazil. We classified the pollinators as effective, occasional, or potential, and also identified those species quoted simply as "visitors" (without reference to pollination). We found 250 crop pollinators pertaining to the three categories quoted, with 168 effective ones. Besides, we identified the effective pollinators of 75 agricultural crops. Bees pertaining to the family Apidae, mainly those from the genera Melipona, Xylocopa, Centris, and Bombus, were reportedly the most effective pollinators of agricultural crops. We also found that the exotic managed species Apis mellifera and the stingless bee Trigona spinipes are effective pollinators of some crops. In spite of some data having been originated from gray literature and the taxonomic impediment, this effort is a crucial step to clarify the gaps and bias on data. This study is the first to attempt to build, analyze, and make available a comprehensive data set about pollinators of agricultural crops in a country level, aiming to contribute to protective measures and to enhance the sustainable use of native pollinators in agriculture.

Floral biology of the Cunoniaceae in New Caledonia and the role of insects, birds and geckos as potential pollinators	KEW BULLETIN			English	Article						bee-pollination; bird-pollination; floral syndromes; generalist-pollination; halictid bees; insect-pollination; lizard-pollination	HYMENOPTERA APOIDEA HALICTIDAE; PANCHERIA CUNONIACEAE; SOUTHWEST PACIFIC; HONEY-BEES; LIZARDS; PLANT; MORPHOLOGY; GENUS; EVOLUTION; DIVERSITY	Cunoniaceae are represented in New Caledonia by some 90 species, all of them endemic, and the family is thus a significant element in this diverse island flora. We present a descriptive survey of floral biology for the seven genera present, covering floral structure and colour, inflorescence shape, sexual system and phenology, plus details of floral visitors, where known, based on field observations; individual records of potential pollinators are tabulated in appendices. The flowers are polysymmetric (or almost so) and provide nectar and/or pollen as floral rewards. Two genera are dioecious and some species are mass flowering. Generalist entomophily is associated with several floral syndromes although the introduction of Apis mellifera has partially obscured historic relationships between some Cunoniaceae and their insect-pollinators. Codia and Pancheria both have sweetly scented, often creamish, spherical capitula and their floral visitors include honey bees, beetles, flies and native bees, especially halictids. Spiraeanthemum and Hooglandia have small, often whitish flowers in paniculate inflorescences but data on potential pollinators are few. Racemes occur in Weinmannia (flowers white, apparently scentless) and Cunonia p.p. (flowers white, pink or reddish with a faint foetid odour); visitors are mostly honey bees, plus ants, butterflies and native bees, and occasionally birds in the case of two reddish-flowered species. Ornithophily occurs in Geissois (flowers red, scentless, in bottle-brush racemes) and Cunonia macrophylla (flowers yellow-green, in one-sided racemes); their floral visitors are commonly Meliphagidae plus some Psittacidae and Zosteropidae. Pteropodid bats are also occasional visitors to Geissois. Geckos have been reported as flower-visitors in two genera though their contribution to pollen transfer is likely to be sporadic at most. Topics that require further investigation include some details of floral biology and the floral cycle, and the possible adaptive significance of different inflorescence shapes. Unanswered questions include: What visits taxa with paniculate inflorescences?, and for all genera: Which types of floral visitor are the most efficient pollinators? For the family as a whole, generalist entomophily appears to be the ancestral mode of pollen transfer and morphological specialisations to ornithophily have occurred independently in two groups of species and possibly in a third. Our data on birds and geckos agree with a known trend for these types of floral visitation and pollination to be well developed on islands, and flower-visiting by lizards in New Caledonia is likely to be more common than has been documented so far, both in Cunoniaceae and in the flora as a whole.

Evaluating multiplexed next-generation sequencing as a method in palynology for mixed pollen samples	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						DNA barcoding; high throughput; internal transcribed spacer 2; ITS2; meta-barcoding; molecular ecology; phylotyping; pollination; plant-pollinator interactions	HYMENOPTERA APOIDEA; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; DNA; HONEY; DIVERSITY; BEES; IDENTIFICATION; BARCODE	The identification of pollen plays an important role in ecology, palaeo-climatology, honey quality control and other areas. Currently, expert knowledge and reference collections are essential to identify pollen origin through light microscopy. Pollen identification through molecular sequencing and DNA barcoding has been proposed as an alternative approach, but the assessment of mixed pollen samples originating from multiple plant species is still a tedious and error-prone task. Next-generation sequencing has been proposed to avoid this hindrance. In this study we assessed mixed pollen probes through next-generation sequencing of amplicons from the highly variable, species-specific internal transcribed spacer 2 region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Further, we developed a bioinformatic workflow to analyse these high-throughput data with a newly created reference database. To evaluate the feasibility, we compared results from classical identification based on light microscopy from the same samples with our sequencing results. We assessed in total 16 mixed pollen samples, 14 originated from honeybee colonies and two from solitary bee nests. The sequencing technique resulted in higher taxon richness (deeper assignments and more identified taxa) compared to light microscopy. Abundance estimations from sequencing data were significantly correlated with counted abundances through light microscopy. Simulation analyses of taxon specificity and sensitivity indicate that 96% of taxa present in the database are correctly identifiable at the genus level and 70% at the species level. Next-generation sequencing thus presents a useful and efficient workflow to identify pollen at the genus and species level without requiring specialised palynological expert knowledge.

Effectiveness of managed populations of wild and honey bees as supplemental pollinators of sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) under different climatic conditions	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Osmia rufa; Bombus terrestris; Apis mellifera; Prunus cerasus cv. 'Stevnsbaer'; fruit set; weather conditions	APIS-MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA; OSMIA-CORNUTA HYMENOPTERA; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS L.; FRUIT-SET; CROP POLLINATION; BUMBLE BEE; PATHOGEN SPILLOVER; MEGACHILIDAE; APIDAE; ORCHARD	Managed populations of Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia have been investigated rufa as sour cherry pollinators in two flowering seasons with different weather patterns. Flight activity of the three bee species during the pollination-receptive period of the cultivar 'Stevnsbaer' was recorded. Also, using insect-proof cages constructed around 'Stevnsbaer' trees, fruit set and yield were recorded and compared with self-pollination in the absence of insects and open pollination. When floral development and seasonal conditions are suitable, there is a potential role for introduced Osmia rufa and B. terrestris to add to the pollination activity of conventionally employed A. mellifera. However, in a season with a less favourable weather history, and despite comparable activity of the three species during the pollen-receptive period, introduced bees had only a limited effect on fruit set and yield and could not raise yield above that of freely pollinated branches. The contribution of appropriately dense populations of introduced bees in the orchard, given favourable weather conditions, is clear, but maintenance of populations of introduced, wild bees, compared with honey bees may well be impractical due to cost. Known ecological risks associated with species introduction also need to be considered. Consequently, if wild bee populations are to be used to secure the potential benefits of increased fruit set and yield, then positive habitat management will be necessary to sustain the required populations.

J	Gisder, S; Genersch, E				Gisder, Sebastian; Genersch, Elke			Identification of Candidate Agents Active against N. ceranae Infection in Honey Bees: Establishment of a Medium Throughput Screening Assay Based on N. ceranae Infected Cultured Cells	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENCEPHALITOZOON SP MICROSPORIDIA; APIS-MELLIFERA-IBERIENSIS; NOSEMA-CERANAE; PARASITE; HYMENOPTERA; SURFACTIN; PATHOGEN; GERMINATION; POLLINATORS; VENTRICULUS	Many flowering plants in both natural ecosytems and agriculture are dependent on insect pollination for fruit set and seed production. Managed honey bees (Apis mellifera) and wild bees are key pollinators providing this indispensable eco- and agrosystem service. Like all other organisms, bees are attacked by numerous pathogens and parasites. Nosema apis is a honey bee pathogenic microsporidium which is widely distributed in honey bee populations without causing much harm. Its congener Nosema ceranae was originally described as pathogen of the Eastern honey bee (Apis cerana) but jumped host from A. cerana to A. mellifera about 20 years ago and spilled over from A. mellifera to Bombus spp. quite recently. N. ceranae is now considered a deadly emerging parasite of both Western honey bees and bumblebees. Hence, novel and sustainable treatment strategies against N. ceranae are urgently needed to protect honey and wild bees. We here present the development of an in vitro medium throughput screening assay for the identification of candidate agents active against N. ceranae infections. This novel assay is based on our recently developed cell culture model for N. ceranae and coupled with an RT-PCR-ELISA protocol for quantification of N. ceranae in infected cells. The assay has been adapted to the 96-well microplate format to allow automated analysis. Several substances with known (fumagillin) or presumed (surfactin) or no (paromomycin) activity against N. ceranae were tested as well as substances for which no data concerning N. ceranae inhibition existed. While fumagillin and two nitroimidazoles (metronidazole, tinidazole) totally inhibited N. ceranae proliferation, all other test substances were inactive. In summary, the assay proved suitable for substance screening and demonstrated the activity of two synthetic antibiotics against N. ceranae.

Wild bee pollinator communities of lowbush blueberry fields: Spatial and temporal trends	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Apoidea; Lasioglossum; Andrena; Vaccinium angustifolium; Temporal and spatial community dynamics	VACCINIUM-CORYMBOSUM L; FORAGING RANGES; HYMENOPTERA; BIODIVERSITY; APOIDEA; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; HABITATS; SERVICES; MARGINS	Pollination by bees (Apoidea) is a critical component of lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Ation: Ericaceae) production. Though most blueberry growers in eastern Canada use managed bees in lowbush blueberry pollination, native pollinators are recognized as an important component of the pollination service provision. In this study we examined the diversity and abundance of native bees in lowbush blueberry fields in Nova Scotia, while considering spatial and temporal patterns in their distribution over the growing season. In total, we collected 95 species representing 13 genera, of which Lasioglossum and Andrena comprised >92% of all individuals. The abundance of several of the most common species was inversely related to distance from the forest edge, but was low inside the adjacent forest. In contrast, species diversity was highest inside the forest and consistently low within fields. Larger bees were found further into fields than smaller bees. Whereas some abundant bees were collected most often outside the blueberry bloom period, Lasioglossum cressonii, the most abundant species, was collected often during blueberry bloom, suggesting it could be an effective pollinator in this system. The results highlight wild bee taxa that could be targeted for conservation efforts to potentially decrease reliance on managed pollinators.

ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; FORAGING RANGES; SOLITARY BEES; DIVERSITY; TRAITS; EVOLUTION; HYMENOPTERA; SCALE; DIVERSIFICATION	A central goal in ecology is to develop theories that explain the diversity and distribution of species. The evolutionary history of species and their functional traits may provide mechanistic links between community assembly and the environment. Such links may be hierarchically structured such that the strength of environmental filtering decreases in a step-wise manner from regional conditions through landscape heterogeneity to local habitat conditions. We sampled the wild bee species assemblages in power-line strips transecting forests in south-eastern Norway. We used altitude, landscape diversity surrounding sites and plant species composition, together with total plant cover as proxies for regional, landscape and local environmental filters, respectively. The species richness and abundance of wild bees decreased with altitude. The reduction in species richness and abundance was accompanied by a phylogenetic clustering of wild bee individuals. Furthermore, regional filters followed by local filters best explained the structure of the functional species composition. Sites at high altitudes and sites with Ericaceae-dominated plant communities tended to have larger bees and a higher proportion of social and spring-emerging bees. When Bombus species were excluded from the analysis, the proportion of pollen specialists increased with the dominance of Ericaceae. Furthermore, we also found that the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional compositional turnover between sites was higher in the northern region than in the southern part of the study region. Altogether, these results suggest that regional filters drive the species richness and abundance in trait-groups whereas local filters have more descrete sorting effects. We conclude that the model of multi-level environmental filters provides a good conceptual model for community ecology. We suggest that future studies should focus on the relationship between the biogeographical history of species and their current distribution, and on the assumption that closely related species do indeed compete more intensely than distantly related species.

However, negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity can be reduced if resources in urban or semi-natural areas in the surrounding matrix can be used by wildlife. We investigated the influence of floral and nesting resources in urban- and forest-associated oak-savannah fragments, surrounding urban and forest matrix, and urban areas spatially independent from oak-savannah habitat on pollinator community composition in a fragmented oak-savannah ecosystem. Both independent urban and urban matrix sites supported high abundance and richness of plants and pollinators relative to other fragment categories, especially towards the end of the season when plants and pollinators in oak-savannah fragments were scarce. A species of particular conservation concern in our region, Bombus occidentalis, was supported by late-flowering resources in our urban sites. Forest-associated oak-savannah fragments were missing late-season species while urban-associated fragments supported high abundance and richness of mid- to late-season pollinators, likely due to supplemental use of floral resources in the urban matrix. Female cavity-nesting and ground-nesting bees were not restricted by the availability of natural nesting resources we expected them to require (e.g. small cavities, bare soil). These results provide important information on native pollinators in a highly fragmented habitat, and suggest that we should consider matrix quality in conservation planning.

Pollination services are mediated by bee functional diversity and landscape context	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agroecosystems; Functional complementarity; Honey bees; Malus x domestica; Pollination limitation; Wild bees	APIS-MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ANNAPOLIS VALLEY; OSMIA-CORNUTA; NOVA-SCOTIA; WILD BEES; APPLE; POLLEN; MEGACHILIDAE; COMMUNITIES	Wild bees, which exhibit multiple functional traits enabling pollination of apples (Malus domestica Borkh), can potentially compensate for recent declines in domesticated honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) that are conventionally employed to ensure apple fruit and seed set. Whether compensation is possible will depend on functional diversity in the wild bee community and on the distribution of habitat and resources within the landscape surrounding an orchard that affect wild bee abundance. We studied pollination services and bee functional diversity in 20 apple orchards in southern Quebec, Canada. We evaluated pollinator efficacy by studying: apple visitation rates, approach (front or side-working), body size, foraging type (pollen or nectar foraging), sociality, temporal and climatic activity patterns, and pollen carrying habit. Pollination services were measured as apple fruit set and seed set. A distance-based measure of functional diversity, calibrated with bee traits and weighted by species relative abundance in the wild bee community, was used to model pollination services. We correlated the landscape composition and configuration of surrounding natural (forest) and semi-natural (meadow) habitats with bee diversity and pollination services. The incidence of fruit set and seed set in orchards increased with bee functional diversity. Complementarity between managed versus unmanaged bees in traits associated with foraging and resource use drove this relationship. Seed set was also negatively correlated with both the mean distance from surrounding meadows and the total area of surrounding orchards. Bee functional diversity was positively associated with surrounding meadow and forest area. These two land classes complement each other in their seasonal provision of foraging resources for bees. Our models can be used to prescribe management and conservation objectives for bee habitat management that promote pollination services. We identify useful wild bee pollinators and discuss their needs in terms of landscape composition and configuration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is in the interest of the bumble bee rearing industry, which succeeds best when managed colonies are healthy and vigorous, and the safety of the environment into which the bees are introduced, to ensure that managed bees are not foci of disease. Visual detection methods using gross pathology and light microscopy, while generally efficacious if a thorough inspection routine is followed, have the disadvantage of detecting most pathogens only after maturation to the transmissible stage. Koppert Biological Systems, the only company currently rearing bumble bees in the US, has instituted a detection method using multiplex real-time PCR to evaluate colonies for presence of three pathogens, Nosema bombi, Crithidia bombi, and Apicystis bombi, all chronic pathogens with potential to build to high prevalence in rearing facilities. Added to a rigorous inspection system, PCR methods ensure that these pathogens are detected quickly and are eliminated.

The aim of this study was to identify the floral visitors and potential pollinators of the Andean blueberry in two growing areas. The study was done in four samplings areas distributed in Guacheta (Cundinamarca), Raquira and San Miguel de Sema (Boyaca) during the first blooming season of 2012. The floral visitors were recorded between 06:00 and 17:00 h, visitors behavior was recorded and pollen samples obtained from their bodies. The Pollination Probability Index (PPI) of the main visitors was calculated, and also the contribution to the pollination service through the Pollination Importance Index (PII). A total of 11 insect species was identified visiting Andean blueberry, of which Apis mellifera, Bombus hortulanus and B. rubicundus were the most frequently in all sampling areas. Both species of Bombus vibrate flowers to remove pollen, been B. hortulanus the visitor that transported the most Andean blueberry pollen. Apis mellifera visits flowers to gather nectar, but it can also transport Andean blueberry pollen. The contribution of the main visitors to the Andean blueberry pollination varies between sampling areas, been highest the contribution of A. mellifera in Guacheta-Raquira, and the B. hortulanus in San Miguel de Sema.

This study was conducted to determine the antibacterial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) activity, total phenolic and flavonoid contents of this wild honey. All samples were extracted using 80% and absolute methanol. For antibacterial activity, wild A. cerana honey showed the strongest effect against all five different bacteria strains tested with its greatest activity against Bacillus cereus with the value of 16.00 mm (100% concentration) in 80% methanol extract. As for the MIC activity, wild A. cerana and wild A. nuluensis honey have the lowest MIC value against the tested bacteria with the lowest against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. Total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were highest in the wild A. cerana honey with the values of 10.43 +/- .02 and 8.76 +/- .00 mg/g in 80% methanol extract. These findings suggested that the wild honey from Sabah have a wide range of phytochemical content and antibacterial activities against different strains of bacteria which might contribute to the development of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals products.

J	Shelby, N; Peterson, MA				Shelby, Natasha; Peterson, Merrill A.			Despite Extensive Pollinator Sharing, Invasive Blackberry Has Negligible Impacts on Reproductive Success of a Rare Native Wildflower	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article						pollinator competition; pollen supplementation; scanning electron microscopy	POLLEN LIMITATION; PLANT REPRODUCTION; LYTHRUM-SALICARIA; MIMULUS-RINGENS; SEED PRODUCTION; COMPETITION; RUBUS; COMMUNITIES; VISITATION; DIVERSITY	Plant invasions have the potential to disrupt community dynamics and impair essential ecosystem services, including the pollination of native flowers. Invaders most likely to invoke pollinator competition are characterized by conspicuous, resource-rich blooms and long flowering periods, while the natives most likely to be impacted are obligate out-crossers that are sensitive to disturbance or locally rare. We investigated the effects of a widespread showy invader of the Pacific Northwest, Rubus armeniacus (Himalayan blackberry), on an imperiled endemic wildflower, Sidalcea hendersonii. We observed pollinators, quantified pollen deposition and conducted pollen-supplementation experiments on S. hendersonii plants growing at three distances (1 m, 15 m and 50 m) from well-established blackberry patches in five adjacent field plots. Individual R. armeniacus flowers received more than three times as many total visits as S. hendersonii inflorescences; however, there was minimal overlap between the pollinator assemblages visiting the two species. R. armeniacus pollen was present on 67% of S. hendersonii stigmas; however, there was no significant relationship between distance and invasive pollen deposition or distance and natural seed set. Pollen-supplementation experiments revealed that S. hendersonii was moderately pollen-limited at all distances, and reproductive output was actually higher at the distance treatment closest to the invader, suggesting a positive proximity effect unrelated to pollination. Thus, although inconstant pollinator foraging and prodigious heterospecific pollen deposition suggest R. armeniacus influences pollinator interactions, it does not appear that the invader directly limits the reproductive success of S. hendersonii.

Many cultivated plants do well with exotic pollinators, and native pollinators can also serve exotic crops. Both can be optimized for agriculture. We studied Nephelium lappaceum L. (Sapindaceae), an andro-dioecious Asian plant, in tropical Mexico. The hermaphrodite flowers were not known to shed viable pollen, and outcrossing from male pollinating plants was thought essential for efficient horticulture. Materials and methods. We used the locally developed CERI61 variety of rambutan and conducted experiments on pollination and fruit yield. An orchard of 1,000 trees was studied intensively during two flowering seasons in Chiapas, Mexico. Plantation yields were recorded for 10 years. We compared open pollination experiments with pollinator exclusion and 'induced pollination' treatments. We caged some trees with colonies of stingless bees: Scaptotrigona and Tetragonisca. Results and discussion. Caged flowers produced fruit, with no male plant present. Pollen dehisced and was viable on approximately 5% of flowers. Trees caged with pollinators, and open pollination treatments revealed 9.1 times more mature fruit than trees without pollinators. Fruit mass was significantly higher in induced pollination treatments. Yields exceeding 7 t ha(-1) were obtained during a ten-year test period. Scaptotrigona mexicana (Apidae, Meliponini) was the main pollinator, followed by social halictid bees (Halictus hesperus). Feral Africanized honeybees were not strongly attracted to flowers. Conclusion. Both stingless bee species in open pollination treatments and within cages showed that fruit production increased nearly 10-fold in this variety of rambutan. Although outcrossing versus selfing did not affect initial mature fruit set, a superior fruit yield, in weight and size, was obtained from selfing mediated by pollinators in caged trees.

J	Melathopoulos, AP; Cutler, GC; Tyedmers, P				Melathopoulos, Andony P.; Cutler, G. Christopher; Tyedmers, Peter			Where is the value in valuing pollination ecosystem services to agriculture?	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Ecosystem servicesValuationWild pollinator	COFFEE AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS; WILD BEE POLLINATORS; HONEY-BEES; ECONOMIC VALUE; BUMBLE BEES; LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY; CROP POLLINATION; UNITED-STATES; NATIVE BEES; FRUIT-SET	Current national and global scale monetary valuation of pollination services do not accurately estimate the contribution of wild pollinators to agricultural production. First, ecosystem (wild) pollination services remain largely bundled with those of managed pollinators. This problem is compounded by the fact that the dependency of crops on pollination, a key parameter used in current valuations, does not reflect variation in pollinator density, crop cultivars and growing conditions that exist in practice. Over half of the 153 billion of estimated global pollination service value in 2005 is based on estimates of pollinator dependency from crops with fewer than three field studies that measure actual levels of pollinator activity and corresponding fruit set. The resulting uncertainty may be most distorting when applied to widely-planted intensive oilseed crops. Furthermore, current valuations are underpinned by simplistic assumptions regarding the likelihood of pollinator decline and the impact on agricultural prices. Although efforts to motivate wild pollinator protection through their ecosystem service value remain highly circumscribed by conceptual and empirical limitations, we identify the need to go beyond technical solutions and develop a critical framework that could account for why pollinator conservation has come to be predominantly justified in these terms to begin with.

However, little is known about pesticide impacts on natural populations of native honey bee species. This study looked into the effect of pesticides with respect to oxidative stress in the laboratory and in field populations of two native Indian honey bee species (Apis dorsata and A. cerana) by examining a combination of biomarkers, e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase and xanthine oxidase. A significant upregulation of all three biomarkers was observed in both treated individuals in laboratory experiments and field populations sampled from a pesticide use gradient. This study reports, for the first time, an increase in expression of xanthine oxidase in an invertebrate system (honey bees) exposed to pesticides.

Changes in nectar production can in turn strongly affect plant-pollinator interaction networks-pollinators may potentially benefit under moderate warming conditions, but suffer as resources reduce in availability as elevated temperatures become more extreme. Here, we studied the effect of elevated temperatures on nectar secretion of two Mediterranean Lamiaceae species-Ballota acetabulosa and Teucrium divaricatum. We measured nectar production (viz. volume per flower, sugar concentration per flower and sugar content per flower and per plant), number of open and empty flowers per plant, as well as biomass per flower under a range of temperatures selected ad hoc in a fully controlled climate chamber and under natural conditions outdoors. The average temperature in the climate chamber was increased every 3 days in 3 degrees C increments from 17.5 to 38.5 degrees C. Both study species showed a unimodal response of nectar production (volume per flower, sugar content per flower and per plant) to temperature. Optimal temperature for sugar content per flower was 25-26 degrees C for B. acetabulosa and 29-33 degrees C for T. divaricatum. According to our results, moderate climate warming predicted for the next few decades could benefit nectar secretion in T. divaricatum as long as the plants are not water stressed, but have a moderate negative effect on B. acetabulosa. Nevertheless, strong warming as predicted by climate change models for the end of the 21st century is expected to reduce nectar secretion in both species and can thus significantly reduce available resources for both wild bees and honeybees in Mediterranean systems.

USBombus, a database of contemporary survey data for North American Bumble Bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Bombus) distributed in the United States	BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL			English	Article; Data Paper						Anthophila; Apoidea; bees; native; standardized survey; North America; Nearctic; pollinators		Background Bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Bombus) are pollinators of wild and economically important flowering plants. However, at least four bumble bee species have declined significantly in population abundance and geographic range relative to historic estimates, and one species is possibly extinct. While a wealth of historic data is now available for many of the North American species found to be in decline in online databases, systematic survey data of stable species is still not publically available. The availability of contemporary survey data is critically important for the future monitoring of wild bumble bee populations. Without such data, the ability to ascertain the conservation status of bumble bees in the United States will remain challenging. New information This paper describes USBombus, a large database that represents the outcomes of one of the largest standardized surveys of bumble bee pollinators (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Bombus) globally. The motivation to collect live bumble bees across the United States was to examine the decline and conservation status of Bombus affinis, B. occidentalis, B. pensylvanicus, and B. terricola. Prior to our national survey of bumble bees in the United States from 2007 to 2010, there have only been regional accounts of bumble bee abundance and richness. In addition to surveying declining bumble bees, we also collected and documented a diversity of co-occuring bumble bees. However we have not yet completely reported their distribution and diversity onto a public online platform. Now, for the first time, we report the geographic distribution of bumble bees reported to be in decline (Cameron et al. 2011), as well as bumble bees that appeared to be stable on a large geographic scale in the United States (not in decline). In this database we report a total of 17,930 adult occurrence records across 397 locations and 39 species of Bombus detected in our national survey. We summarize their abundance and distribution across the United States and association to different ecoregions. The geospatial coverage of the dataset extends across 41 of the 50 US states, and from 0 to 3500 m a.s.l. Authors and respective field crews spent a total of 512 hours surveying bumble bees from 2007 to 2010. The dataset was developed using SQL server 2008 r2. For each specimen, the following information is generally provided: species, name, sex, caste, temporal and geospatial details, Cartesian coordinates, data collector(s), and when available, host plants. This database has already proven useful for a variety of studies on bumble bee ecology and conservation. However it is not publicly available. Considering the value of pollinators in agriculture and wild ecosystems, this large database of bumble bees will likely prove useful for investigations of the effects of anthropogenic activities on pollinator community composition and conservation status.

Effects of neonicotinoids and fipronil on non-target invertebrates	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Pesticides; Neonicotinoids; Fipronil; Non-target species; Invertebrates; Honeybee; Earthworms; Butterflies; Freshwater habitat; Marine habitat	HONEYBEE APIS-MELLIFERA; CHILO-SUPPRESSALIS LEPIDOPTERA; DIAMONDBACK MOTH LEPIDOPTERA; EUROPEAN CORN-BORER; BOMBUS-IMPATIENS HYMENOPTERA; CYDIA-POMONELLA LEPIDOPTERA; DECREASES FORAGING SUCCESS; OPERCULELLA ZELLER LEPIDOPTERA; SPECIES APORRECTODEA-NOCTURNA; SPODOPTERA-LITURA LEPIDOPTERA	We assessed the state of knowledge regarding the effects of large-scale pollution with neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on non-target invertebrate species of terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. A large section of the assessment is dedicated to the state of knowledge on sublethal effects on honeybees (Apis mellifera) because this important pollinator is the most studied non-target invertebrate species. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Lumbricidae (earthworms), Apoidae sensu lato (bumblebees, solitary bees) and the section "other invertebrates" review available studies on the other terrestrial species. The sections on freshwater and marine species are rather short as little is known so far about the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on the diverse invertebrate fauna of these widely exposed habitats. For terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate species, the known effects of neonicotinoid pesticides and fipronil are described ranging from organismal toxicology and behavioural effects to population-level effects. For earthworms, freshwater and marine species, the relation of findings to regulatory risk assessment is described. Neonicotinoid insecticides exhibit very high toxicity to a wide range of invertebrates, particularly insects, and field-realistic exposure is likely to result in both lethal and a broad range of important sublethal impacts. There is a major knowledge gap regarding impacts on the grand majority of invertebrates, many of which perform essential roles enabling healthy ecosystem functioning. The data on the few non-target species on which field tests have been performed are limited by major flaws in the outdated test protocols. Despite large knowledge gaps and uncertainties, enough knowledge exists to conclude that existing levels of pollution with neonicotinoids and fipronil resulting from presently authorized uses frequently exceed the lowest observed adverse effect concentrations and are thus likely to have large-scale and wide ranging negative biological and ecological impacts on a wide range of non-target invertebrates in terrestrial, aquatic, marine and benthic habitats.

Genotype effect on lifespan following vitellogenin knockdown	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY			English	Article						Vitellogenin; RNA-interference; Apis mellifera; Foraging; Longevity	HONEY-BEE WORKERS; APIS-MELLIFERA L.; COLONY-LEVEL SELECTION; DIVISION-OF-LABOR; JUVENILE-HORMONE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; FAT-BODY; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; GENE-EXPRESSION; ADULT WORKER	Honey bee workers display remarkable flexibility in the aging process. This plasticity is closely tied to behavioral maturation. Workers who initiate foraging behavior at earlier ages have shorter lifespans, and much of the variation in total lifespan can be explained by differences in pre-foraging lifespan. Vitellogenin (Vg), a yolk precursor protein, influences worker lifespan both as a regulator of behavioral maturation and through anti-oxidant and immune functions. Experimental reduction of Vg mRNA, and thus Vg protein levels, in wild-type bees results in precocious foraging behavior, decreased lifespan, and increased susceptibility to oxidative damage. We sought to separate the effects of Vg on lifespan due to behavioral maturation from those due to immune and antioxidant function using two selected strains of honey bees that differ in their phenotypic responsiveness to Vg gene knockdown. Surprisingly, we found that lifespans lengthen in the strain described as behaviorally and hormonally insensitive to Vg reduction. We then performed targeted gene expression analyses on genes hypothesized to mediate aging and lifespan: the insulin-like peptides (Ilp1 and 2) and manganese superoxide dismutase (mnSOD). The two honey bee Ilps are the most upstream components in the insulin-signaling pathway, which influences lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster and other organisms, while manganese superoxide dismutase encodes an enzyme with antioxidant functions in animals. We found expression differences in the llps in fat body related to behavior (llp1 and 2) and genetic background (Ilp2), but did not find strain by treatment effects. Expression of mnSOD was also affected by behavior and genetic background. Additionally, we observed a differential response to Vg knockdown in fat body expression of mnSOD, suggesting that antioxidant pathways may partially explain the strain-specific lifespan responses to Vg knockdown.

J	Ratnieks, FLW; Shackleton, K				Ratnieks, Francis L. W.; Shackleton, Kyle			Does the waggle dance help honey bees to forage at greater distances than expected for their body size?	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Review						waggle dance; foraging distance; honey bee; central-place forager; foraging ecology	STINGLESS BEE; FOOD LOCATION; RECRUITMENT; COLONIES; RANGE; COMMUNICATION; BENEFITS; BUMBLEBEES; BEHAVIOR; QUALITY	A honey bee colony has been likened to an oil company. Some members of the company or colony prospect for valuable liquid resources. When these are discovered other group members can be recruited to exploit the resource. The recruitment of nestmates to a specific location where there is a patch of flowers should change the economics of scouting, that is, the search for new resource patches. In particular, communication is predicted to make scouting at longer distances worthwhile because a profitable resource patch, once discovered, will enhance the foraging not only of the discoverer but also of nestmates that can be directed to the patch. By virtue of having large colonies and dance communication, honey bees are predicted to be able to profitably scout, and hence forage, at greater distances from the nest than either solitary bees or social bees without communication. We test this hypothesis by first examining existing data on foraging distance to evaluate whether honey bees do indeed forage at greater distances than other bees given their body size. Second, we present a simple cost-benefit analysis of scouting which indicates that communication causes longer range scouting to be more profitable. Overall, our analyses are supportive, but not conclusive, that honey bees forage further than would be expected given their size and that the waggle dance is a cause of the honey bee's exceptional foraging range.

As a result of interspecific interactions such as pollination, the decline, loss, or introduction of species can have cascading effects on island ecosystems. We studied Hylaeus spp., Hawai'i's yellow-faced bees, the only native bees in Hawai'i. This group of potentially important pollinators has been largely overlooked until recently, and its conservation status and ecological role are virtually unknown. We investigated how native (Hylaeus spp.) and nonnative (Apis mellifera) bees interact with flowering plants in a large-scale pasture-to-forest restoration system. We used pan traps and nets to collect bees in mature forest, remnant corridors, planted Acacia koa tracts, and open pastureland. We removed pollen from each specimen and identified it using pollen samples collected on-site. We found that Hylaeus spp. were more likely to carry less pollen and more likely to exhibit higher pollinator fidelity compared with A. mellifera. By contrast, A. mellifera was more likely to carry mixed pollen and forage on invasive plant species. This is the first investigation in Hawai` i to compare patterns of pollen carriage between native and nonnative bees and the first study to document pollen carried by Hylaeus spp. in the context of forest restoration.

A completely randomized experimental design was carried out, with ten replicates and one flower per plot to evaluate morphometry, and with four replicates and five flowers per cultivar to determine the fruiting rate. The following parameters were evaluated: flower morphology and morphometry, flower longevity, frequency of floral visitors, natural fruiting rate, and fruit quality. Flower morphology and morphometry were compatible with pollination by large-size bees; they were also compatible with pollination by medium-size bees for the cultivars IAC-275-Maravilha, IAC-277-Joia, BRS SC1, BRS RC, and BRS GA1. The greatest flower longevity was observed for the IAC-277-Joia, BRS GA1, BRS RC, and BRS OV1 cultivars. The frequency of bees as Xylocopa (2.0%) and Bombus (3.9%) was low, and 'BRS GA1' received the highest number of these bee visits. Natural fruiting rate was low (36.67%). Naturally pollinated fruit show physical traits compatible with those required by the market standards.

Strategies to mitigate bee loss generally aim to enhance floral resources. However, we do not really know whether loss of preferred floral resources is the key driver of bee decline because accurate assessment of host plant preferences is difficult, particularly for species that have become rare. Here we examine whether population trends of wild bees in The Netherlands can be explained by trends in host plants, and how this relates to other factors such as climate change. We determined host plant preference of bee species using pollen loads on specimens in entomological collections that were collected before the onset of their decline, and used atlas data to quantify population trends of bee species and their host plants. We show that decline of preferred host plant species was one of two main factors associated with bee decline. Bee body size, the other main factor, was negatively related to population trend, which, because larger bee species have larger pollen requirements than smaller species, may also point toward food limitation as a key factor driving wild bee loss. Diet breadth and other potential factors such as length of flight period or climate change sensitivity were not important in explaining twentieth century bee population trends. These results highlight the species-specific nature of wild bee decline and indicate that mitigation strategies will only be effective if they target the specific host plants of declining species.

AS A POLLEN SOURCE FOR BEE FRIENDLY GARDENS	JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						bee pasture; Centaurea dealbata; Centaurea mollis; Centaurea montana; insect visitors; pollen production	NECTAR PRODUCTION; PLANT; POLLINATORS; BIOLOGY; CONSERVATION; EVOLUTION; AREAS	The flowering phenology and pollen production of three ornamental Centaurea species were investigated in the years 2009 and 2012-2013. The study objects, Centaurea montana L. = Cyanus montanus (L.) Hill, Centaurea mollis Waldst & Kit, and Centaurea dealbata Willd. were cultivated within an area of the UMCS Botanical Garden in Lublin, Poland (51 degrees 14' N, 22 degrees 34' E). Under the environmental conditions of SE Poland, the Centaurea species flowered continuously from mid-May to the first week of June. The mass of pollen in anthers was found to be species-related: 3.70 mg (C. montana), 4.02 mg (C. mollis), and 6.01 mg (C. dealbata) per 100 anthers. The total pollen yield was related to the mass of pollen produced in flowers and the abundance of blooming. Pollen grains were medium-sized, spheroid (C. dealbata) or prolato-spheroid (C. mollis and C. montana) in shape, and characterized by high viability (over 80% on average). The pollen provided by the plants of ornamental Centaurea species amounted to 6.0 - 7.9 g per m(2) on average. The honeybee was the most frequent visitor of C. dealbata, accounting for 55.2% of the total pollinators, and bumblebee species predominated on the flowers of both C. montana (77.7%) and C. mollis (85.6%). Solitary bees and dipterans were also observed on the flowers of all species studied, but C. mollis was avoided by lepidopterans. Ornamental Centaurea species provide pollen reserves that could support communities of invertebrate pollinators, although the period of effective supply fluctuates annually due to changeable periods of blooming.

A number of stressors have been identified as potential contributing factors, including the extensive prophylactic use of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are highly toxic to bees, in agriculture. While multiple routes of exposure to these systemic insecticides have been documented for honey bees, contamination from puddle water has not been investigated. In this study, we used a multi-residue method based on LC-MS/MS to analyze samples of puddle water taken in the field during the planting of treated corn and one month later. If honey bees were to collect and drink water from these puddles, our results showed that they would be exposed to various agricultural pesticides. All water samples collected from corn fields were contaminated with at least one neonicotinoid compound, although most contained more than one systemic insecticide. Concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in early spring, indicating that emission and drifting of contaminated dust during sowing raises contamination levels of puddles. Although the overall average acute risk of drinking water from puddles was relatively low, concentrations of neonicotinoids ranged from 0.01 to 63 mg/L and were sufficient to potentially elicit a wide array of sublethal effects in individuals and colony alike. Our results also suggest that risk assessment of honey bee water resources underestimates the foragers' exposure and consequently miscalculates the risk. In fact, our data shows that honey bees and native pollinators are facing unprecedented cumulative exposure to these insecticides from combined residues in pollen, nectar and water. These findings not only document the impact of this route of exposure for honey bees, they also have implications for the cultivation of a wide variety of crops for which the extensive use of neonicotinoids is currently promoted.

Influence of Nest Box Color and Release Sites on Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) Reproductive Success in a Commercial Almond Orchard	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Osmia lignaria; dispersal; honey bee; mason bee; orchard pollination	NATIVE BEES; PROPINQUA CRESSON; FIELD EXPERIMENTS; APPLE ORCHARDS; POLLINATOR; VISION; DISCRIMINATION; ULTRAVIOLET; MANAGEMENT; EVOLUTION	Intensively managed, commercial orchards offer resources for managed solitary bees within agricultural landscapes and provide a means to study bee dispersal patterns, spatial movement, nest establishment, and reproduction. In 2012, we studied the impact of 1) the color of nest boxes covaried with four nest box density treatments and 2) the number of bee release sites covaried with two nest box density treatments on the reproductive success of Osmia lignaria Say in a California almond orchard pollinated by a mixture of O. lignaria and Apis mellifera L. Nest box color influenced the number of nests, total cells, and cells with male and female brood. More nests and cells were produced in light blue nest boxes than in orange or yellow nest boxes. The covariate nest box density also had a significant effect on brood production. The number of release sites did not affect O. lignaria nesting and reproduction, but the number of cavities in nest boxes influenced reproduction. Overall, the color of nest boxes and their distribution, but not the number of release sites, can greatly affect O. lignaria nest establishment and reproductive success in a commercial almond orchard. The ability to locate nesting sites in a homogenous, large orchard landscape may also be facilitated by the higher frequency of nest boxes with low numbers of cavities, and by the ability to detect certain nest box colors that best contrast with the blooming trees.

J	Benjamin, FE; Winfree, R				Benjamin, Faye E.; Winfree, Rachael			Lack of Pollinators Limits Fruit Production in Commercial Blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						pollen limitation; honey bee; Apis mellifera; native bee; agriculture	CROP POLLINATION; POLLEN LIMITATION; HONEY-BEE; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; PLANT REPRODUCTION; UNITED-STATES; NATIVE BEES; BODY-SIZE; WILD; SERVICES	Modern agriculture relies on domesticated pollinators such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), and to a lesser extent on native pollinators, for the production of animal-pollinated crops. There is growing concern that pollinator availability may not keep pace with increasing agricultural production. However, whether crop production is in fact pollen-limited at the field scale has rarely been studied. Here, we ask whether commercial highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) production in New Jersey is limited by a lack of pollination even when growers provide honey bees at recommended densities. We studied two varieties of blueberry over 3 yr to determine whether blueberry crop production is pollen-limited and to measure the relative contributions of honey bees and native bees to blueberry pollination. We found two lines of evidence for pollen limitation. First, berries receiving supplemental hand-pollination were generally heavier than berries receiving ambient pollination. Second, mean berry mass increased significantly and nonasymptotically with honey bee flower visitation rate. While honey bees provided 86% of pollination and thus drove the findings reported above, native bees still contributed 14% of total pollination even in our conventionally managed, high-input agricultural system. Honey bees and native bees were also similarly efficient as pollinators on a per-visit basis. Overall, our study shows that pollination can be a limiting factor in commercial fruit production. Yields might increase with increased honey bee stocking rates and improved dispersal of hives within crop fields, and with habitat restoration to increase pollination provided by native bees.

Variation in gut microbial communities and its association with pathogen infection in wild bumble bees (Bombus)	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article						Bombus; Gilliamella; gut microbiota; land-use change; pyrosequencing	HONEY-BEES; GEN. NOV.; DIVERSITY; BACTERIA; SPECIFICITY; DECLINE; CONSERVATION; LACTOBACILLI; DYSBIOSIS; SEQUENCES	Bacterial gut symbiont communities are critical for the health of many insect species. However, little is known about how microbial communities vary among host species or how they respond to anthropogenic disturbances. Bacterial communities that differ in richness or composition may vary in their ability to provide nutrients or defenses. We used deep sequencing to investigate gut microbiota of three species in the genus Bombus (bumble bees). Bombus are among the most economically and ecologically important non-managed pollinators. Some species have experienced dramatic declines, probably due to pathogens and land-use change. We examined variation within and across bee species and between semi-natural and conventional agricultural habitats. We categorized as 'core bacteria' any operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with closest hits to sequences previously found exclusively or primarily in the guts of honey bees and bumble bees (genera Apis and Bombus). Microbial community composition differed among bee species. Richness, defined as number of bacterial OTUs, was highest for B. bimaculatus and B. impatiens. For B. bimaculatus, this was due to high richness of non-core bacteria. We found little effect of habitat on microbial communities. Richness of non-core bacteria was negatively associated with bacterial abundance in individual bees, possibly due to deeper sampling of non-core bacteria in bees with low populations of core bacteria. Infection by the gut parasite Crithidia was negatively associated with abundance of the core bacterium Gilliamella and positively associated with richness of non-core bacteria. Our results indicate that Bombus species have distinctive gut communities, and community-level variation is associated with pathogen infection.

The importance of distance to putative wild pollinator habitat (natural field edges) for pollinator abundance within fields and crop yield was also considered. Managed honey bees made 70% of flower visits (85% to Duke, 49% to Bluecrop). Wild bumble bees made half of the visits to Bluecrop. Though bumble bees were observed less frequently as distance from the natural edge increased, there was no effect of distance on levels of crop pollination. Pollination deficits were less pronounced in Duke than Bluecrop, with maximum (hand) pollination leading to a 12% (Duke) to 23% (Bluecrop) increase in yield. Exclusion of pollinators reduced yield by 50-80% compared to ambient pollination. For both cultivars, pollination deficits declined most strongly with either increasing bumble bee visits or increasing total visits (honey bees and bumble bees combined), and in no case were deficit levels significantly reduced by honey bees alone. This study supports a growing body of literature that suggests managed honey bees alone cannot reduce deficits, and that wild pollinators are needed to maximize yields in pollinator-dependent agricultural systems.

Systemic insecticides are recognized as one of the drivers of worldwide honey and wild bee declines. Particularly honeybees in agricultural environments are exposed to pesticides when they collect crop pollen and nectar. However, landscape scale studies which analyze pollen use and foraging distances of honey bees on mass-flowering crops like maize to evaluate potential exposure risks are currently lacking. In an experimental approach on a landscape scale we took advantage of intra-colonial dance communication to gather information about the location of utilized pollen resources. During maize flowering, four observation hives were placed in and rotated between 11 different landscapes which covered a gradient from low to high maize acreage. A higher frequency of dances for foraging locations on maize fields compared to other land use types shows that maize is an intensively used pollen resource for honey bee colonies. Mean foraging distances were significantly shorter for maize pollen than for other pollen origins. The percentage of maize pollen foragers did not increase with maize acreage in the landscape. The proportion of grassland area providing alternative pollen sources did not reduce the percentage of maize pollen foragers. Our findings allow estimating the distance-related exposure risk of honey bee colonies to pollen from surrounding maize fields treated with systemic insecticides. Similarly, the results can be used to estimate the exposure to transgenic maize pollen, which is relevant for honey production in European countries. Provision of alternative pollen resources within agri-environmental schemes could potentially reduce exposure risk to pesticide contaminated crop pollen. (C) 2014 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

J	Blaauw, BR; Isaacs, R				Blaauw, Brett R.; Isaacs, Rufus			Larger patches of diverse floral resources increase insect pollinator density, diversity, and their pollination of native wild flowers	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Wild bees; Honeybees; Syrphidae; Perennial; Richness; Ecosystem service	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; FOREST FRAGMENTATION; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; PLANTS; BEES; SIZE; COMMUNITIES; CONSERVATION; DIPTERA; AREA	Native wildflower plantings can be used to provide nutritional resources to support pollinating insects, yet the effects of planting size and bloom richness on the density, diversity, and function of these insects are not well understood. We established stands of twelve native flowering perennial plant species in replicated plots ranging in size from 1 to 100 m(2). These plots were sampled for insect pollinators, bloom richness, and seed production by three wild flower species. Honeybees, wild bees, and hoverflies all responded positively to increasing flower richness, whereas particular insect pollinator groups responded differently to the size of the flowering plant area. The density of honeybees and hoverflies was not affected by increasing flowering patch size, whereas in general, wild bees were observed at higher density and diversity in the 30 and 100 m(2) patches. Increasing wildflower patch size, and thus wild bee density, resulted in greater seed set in the sampled wild flowers. These results indicate that wild bees are sensitive to the area and richness of floral resources in patches, even at relatively small scales. Therefore, larger wildflower plantings with more diverse flower species mixes are more suitable for the conservation of wild pollinators and reproduction of sown species. 1439-179/(c) 2014 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

J	Simanonok, MP; Burkle, LA				Simanonok, Michael P.; Burkle, Laura A.			Partitioning interaction turnover among alpine pollination networks: spatial, temporal, and environmental patterns	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						beta diversity; elevation; spatiotemporal	BETA-DIVERSITY; BEES; SPECIALIZATION; DISSIMILARITY; COMMUNITIES; REGRESSION; VEGETATION; DISTANCE; ECOLOGY	Ecologists have taken two distinct approaches in studying the distribution and diversity of communities: a species-centric focus and an interaction-network based approach. A current frontier in community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in interactions between two networks). We performed observations of plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2) the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral turnover, simultaneous pollinator & floral turnover, and host switching towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season. Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes consistently greater than 80%, even at time intervals as short as one week. Floral species turnover (41%) and simultaneous floral and pollinator species turnover (36%) accounted for almost all interaction turnover while host switching accounted for only 5%. Interaction turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator interaction partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data. Our observations suggest that host switching does not readily occur at the scales of alpine flowering phenology (i.e., similar to 1 week); however, whether lack of host switching is indicative of inflexible pollinator foraging, or, more likely, a lack of opportunity or necessity to switch hosts, requires further investigation.

PCR reveals high prevalence of non/low sporulating Nosema bombi (microsporidia) infections in bumble bees (Bombus) in Northern Arizona	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Nosema; Bombus; PCR; Arizona	APIS-MELLIFERA; PARASITE PREVALENCE; WILD BUMBLEBEES; SPECIAL FOCUS; TERRESTRIS; TRANSMISSION; HYMENOPTERA; COLONIES; DECLINE; APIDAE	About 20% of bumble bee species are in decline in North America, and the microsporidian pathogen, Nosema bombi, has been correlated with these declines. We conducted a comprehensive survey of N. bombi infections in the bumble bee communities throughout the flight season along an elevation gradient in Northern Arizona. Focusing on two species, Bombus (Pyrobombus) huntii and Bombus (Pyrobombus) centralis, we used a combination of PCR and microscopy to distinguish between sporulating and non/low, sporulating N. bombi infections. Surprisingly high levels of PCR-positive infections with no detectable spore loads were found in B. huntii (31-63%) and B. centralis (56.5-66.5%), while the prevalence of sporulating infections was low (3.0-11.8% and 0-12.9% respectively). We determined the prevalence of sporulating N. bombi infection in six other co-occurring, but rarer, bumble bee species (0-62.5%,), but did not test them using PCR. The prevalence of sporulating N. bombi infections in B. (Bombias) nevadensis was significantly higher than in either B. huntii or B. centralis (29%). The declining bumble bee, Bombus sensu strico occidentalis, had the highest prevalence of sporulating N. bombi infections (62.5%), but we purposely captured very few B. occidentalis because of its declining status. PCR was a more sensitive measure of N. bombi prevalence and revealed that wild bumble bees have a much higher prevalence of N. bombi than has previously been recognized. Microscopy and PCR together provide complementary, not redundant, information that deepens our understanding of the dynamic interactions between N. bombi and their bumble bee hosts.

Spatial and temporal variation in pollinator community structure relative to a woodland-almond plantation edge	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY			English	Review						Edge effect; mallee; mass-flowering; monoculture; SHE analysis	MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; CULTIVATED FIELDS; BEE POLLINATION; HABITAT EDGES; HIGH-LATITUDE; SHE ANALYSIS; HONEY-BEES	Agricultural landscape elements, such as field edges, are not always a barrier to insects but can influence their distribution and dispersal behaviour. The present study investigated spatial and temporal patterns in wild pollinator (fly, wasp and non-Apis bee) distribution across an edge between natural mallee woodland and monoculture almond plantations in southern Australia, during the critical almond flowering period. This is the first study of variation in pollinator community distribution on both sides of an edge between natural vegetation and flowering tree crop plantations. Species richness, diversity and evenness (SHE) analysis was also used to identify changes in pollinator community structure relative to the edge. It is shown that the spatial distribution and structure of pollinator communities can vary across a habitat edge with an abrupt temporal changes in resources. Our results suggest that the plantation edge did not prevent wild pollinators spilling over from woodlands, although vegetation homogeneity and phenological changes in resources most likely influenced the dispersal of pollinators into plantation interiors. The findings of the present study contribute to our knowledge of edge responses by insects in managed landscapes and could motivate growers to adopt ecological management practices in commercial plantations. Future studies of insects near farmland edges should include samples on both sides of the edge and should also consider the landscape context.

A Transmission Right-of-Way as Habitat for Wild Bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) in Connecticut	ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article						early successional community; pollinator; bumble bee decline	BUMBLE BEES; ECONOMIC VALUE; UNITED-STATES; DECLINE; APIDAE; POLLINATORS; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; CRESSON; BOMBUS	Transmission line corridors in forested landscapes provide important early successional habitats for a taxonomically rich array of invertebrates. In this study, we investigated the wild bee diversity at 19 sites along a transmission line right-of-way in southeastern Connecticut over a 2-yr period. One hundred sixty-three species representing 31 genera-roughly 50% of the state's bee species-were captured over the course of the study. Richness estimates suggest total faunas of 152, 180, and 204 bee species for the bee bowl, net, and combined samples, respectively. One globally rare bee, Epeoloides pilosula (Cresson) (Apidae: Osirini), formerly thought to be extirpated in the United States, was recovered. Two rarely collected species, Melitta melittoides (Viereck) (Melittidae) and Colletes productus Robertson (Colletidae), were associated with maleberry (Lyonia ligustrina (L.) de Candolle) flowers. Four Bombus species known to have declined regionally, Bombus affinis Cresson, Bombus ashtoni (Cresson), Bombus pensylvanicus (DeGeer), and Bombus terricola Kirby, were not among the eight bumble bee (Bombus) species found. Our results underscore the importance of transmission line corridors as managed early successional habitat for wild bees, including rare species, in the largely forested landscapes of New England.

Multiple recent introductions of apid bees into Pacific archipelagos signify potentially large consequences for both agriculture and indigenous ecosystems	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Apidae; Anthropogenic introductions; Exotic species; Pollinators; Fiji; Vanuatu; Samoa; South west Pacific	PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; NEW-CALEDONIA; NEW-ZEALAND; GOODBYE GONDWANA; ALLODAPINE BEES; ORIGINS; CONSERVATION; HYMENOPTERA; AUSTRALIA; DNA	The islands of the south west Pacific (SWP) are highly biodiverse, yet records of their bee fauna suggest a region depauperate of a key pollinator suite. Studies of the bees of Fiji based on molecular data have revealed a recent origin with the majority of species having arrived since the last glacial maximum or introduced since human colonization. Here we use DNA barcodes to provide the first detailed account of Apidae bees from Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa. We show that most if not all species in these archipelagos have been recently introduced from Australia and south east Asia, with a further species introduced from the New World. Some of these species have become regionally abundant and we discuss the potential impact of introduced pollinators on endemic plant-pollinator associations. Given the wide-reaching role of native pollinators in island systems, yet lack of understanding of SWP pollinator suites, our study highlights the urgent need for more detailed pollinator research in the region.

First molecular detection of co-infection of honey bee viruses in asymptomatic Bombus atratus in South America	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY			English	Article						Argentine; bumblebee; multiplex PCR	DEFORMED-WING-VIRUS; PARALYSIS VIRUS; PATHOGEN; CONSERVATION; INFECTIONS	Pollination is critical for food production and has the particularity of linking natural ecosystems with agricultural production systems. Recently, losses of bumblebee species have been reported worldwide. In this study, samples from a commercial exploitation of bumblebees of Argentina with a recent history of deaths were studied using a multiplex PCR for the detection of the honey bee viruses most frequently detected in South America. All samples analysed were positive for co-infections with Deformed wing virus, Black queen cell virus and Sacbrood virus. This is the first report of infection of Bombus atratus with honey bee viruses. A better understanding of viral infections in bumblebees and of the epidemiology of viruses could be of great importance as bumblebees can serve as possible viral reservoirs, resulting in pathogen spillover towards honey bees and native bumblebees.

In particular, there are large gaps in the study of the pollination of economically important and traditionally grown species in China. Many plant species grown in China are both edible and used medicinally. The country retains extensive written records of agricultural and apicultural practices, facilitating contemporary studies of some important taxa. Here, we focus on Yunnan in southwestern China, a mega-biodiversity hotspot for medicinal/food plants. We used plant and insect taxa as model systems to understand the patterns and consequences of pollinator deficit to crops. We identified several gaps and limitations in research on the pollination ecology and breeding systems of domesticated taxa and their wild relatives in Yunnan and asked the following questions: (1) What is known about pollination systems of edible and medicinal plants in Yunnan? (2) What are the most important pollinators of Codonopsis subglobosa (Campanulaceae)? (3) How important are native pollinator species for maximizing yield in Chinese crops compared with the introduced Apis mellifera ? We found that some crops that require cross-pollination now depend exclusively on hand pollination. Three domesticated crops are dependent primarily on the native but semidomesticated Apis cerana and the introduced A. mellifera. Other species of wild pollinators often play important roles for certain specialty crops (e. g., Vespa velutina pollinates Codonopsis subglobosa). We propose a more systematic and comprehensive approach to applied research in the future.

Evaluating Pollination Deficits in Pumpkin Production in New York	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Bombus impatiens; Cucurbita pepo; fruit weight; pollen limitation; seed set	WILD BEE ABUNDANCE; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEE; BOMBUS-IMPATIENS; SEED PRODUCTION; FRUIT-SET; LAND-USE; CROP; SUPPLEMENTATION; HYMENOPTERA	Potential decreases in crop yield from reductions in bee-mediated pollination services threaten food production demands of a growing population. Many fruit and vegetable growers supplement their fields with bee colonies during crop bloom. The extent to which crop production requires supplementary pollination services beyond those provided by wild bees is not well documented. Pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo L., requires bee-mediated pollination for fruit development. Previous research identified the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson), as the most efficient pumpkin pollinator. Two concomitant studies were conducted to examine pollination deficits in New York pumpkin fields from 2011 to 2013. In the first study, fruit weight, seed set, and B. impatiens visits to pumpkin flowers were compared across fields supplemented with B. impatiens colonies at a recommended stocking density of five colonies per hectare, a high density of 15 colonies per hectare, or not supplemented with bees. In the second study, fruit weight and seed set of pumpkins that received supplemental pollen through hand-pollination were compared with those that were open-pollinated by wild bees. Results indicated that supplementing pumpkin fields with B. impatiens colonies, regardless of stocking density, did not increase fruit weight, seed set, or B. impatiens visits to pumpkin flowers. Fruit weight and seed set did not differ between hand-and open-pollinated treatments. In general, we conclude that pumpkin production in central New York is not limited by inadequate pollination services provided by wild bees and that on average, supplementation with B. impatiens colonies did not improve pumpkin yield.

Evaluation of Native Bees as Pollinators of Cucurbit Crops Under Floating Row Covers	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Peponapis pruinosa; Xenoglossa strenua; pollination; sustainable agriculture; Cucurbitaceae	PEPONAPIS-PRUINOSA; SQUASH; POPULATIONS; CANTALOUPE; DISEASES; YIELD; PEPO	Production of cucurbit crops presents growers with numerous challenges. Several severe pests and diseases can be managed through the use of rotation, trap cropping, mechanical barriers, such as row covers, and chemical applications. However, considerations must also be made for pollinating insects, as adequate pollination affects the quantity and quality of fruit. Insecticides may negatively affect pollinators; a concern enhanced in recent years due to losses in managed Apis melifera L. colonies. Row covers can be used in place of chemical control before pollination, but when removed, pests have access to fields along with the pollinators. If pollination services of native bees could be harnessed for use under continuous row covers, both concerns could be balanced for growers. The potential of two bee species which specialize on cucurbit flowers, Peponapis pruinosa Say and Xenoglossa strenua Cresson, were assessed under continuous row covers, employed over acorn squash. Experimental treatments included plots with either naturally or artificially introduced bees under row covers and control plots with row covers either permanently removed at crop flowering, or employed continuously with no added pollinating insects. Pests in plots with permanently removed row covers were managed using standard practices used in certified organic production. Marketable yields from plots inoculated with bees were indistinguishable from those produced under standard practices, indicating this system would provide adequate yields to growers without time and monetary inputs of insecticide applications. Additionally, application of this technique was investigated for muskmelon production and discussed along with considerations for farm management.

Landscape diversity moderates the effects of bee visitation frequency to flowers on crop production	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						agroecosystems; bumblebees; conditional process modelling; crop pollination; Cucurbita pepo; ecosystem services; grassland; honeybees; pumpkin	TROPICAL FOREST; FRUIT-SET; LAND-USE; POLLINATION; APIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; HABITATS; CONTEXT; APIS	1. Reductions in natural habitat are implicated in declining honeybee Apis mellifera L. and wild bee populations, thereby threatening crop production. This concern has stimulated interest in identifying landscape-level impacts on bee-mediated pollination services, but previous studies have only inferred connections between landscape, bees and yield through generalized linear regressions. 2. We examined landscape impacts on bee-mediated crop yield using both a traditional linear regression approach and conditional process modelling, which combined landscape features, bee visits to crop flowers, and the interactions between landscape and bee visits to flowers into a single model predicting crop yield. We used the pumpkin Cucurbita pepo L. system in New York State and recorded bees visiting pumpkin flowers in 2011 and 2012. Landscape diversity and percentage of semi-natural grassland around each pumpkin field were calculated. 3. Results from the traditional approach indicated that landscape diversity, percentage of grassland in the landscape, bumblebee Bombus impatiens Cresson and honeybee visitation frequency each positively predicted yield. A common conclusion from these results is that pumpkins grown in highly diverse or high grassland coverage landscapes would have greater yields via bumblebee and honeybee visits to flowers. However, this inference does not preclude the possibility that landscape features may be associated with crop yield, independent of bee visits to flowers. 4. Results from conditional process modelling indicated that only pumpkins grown in highly diverse landscapes were predicted to have greater yields as a consequence of more bumblebee visits to pumpkin flowers. None of the landscape features predicted greater fruit yields as a consequence of more honeybee visits to pumpkin flowers. This novel analysis indicated that traditional approaches may be misinterpreting the relationships between these variables. 5. Synthesis and applications. Bumblebees benefited from a diverse landscape, and their visits to flowers positively impacted pumpkin production. Conservation of a diverse landscape should be promoted to support improved pumpkin production. Growers can use this information to decide where to plant pumpkins to improve the potential for high yields, to identify scenarios where landscape diversity could be increased, and where supplementation with bees might be beneficial.

When mutualism goes bad: density-dependent impacts of introduced bees on plant reproduction	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Review						antagonism; Apis mellifera; benefit-cost balance; Bombus terrestris; density dependence; invasions; mutualism; pollination	POLLINATOR VISITATION; FLORAL NECTAR; HONEY-BEES; BUMBLE BEE; FRUIT-SET; POLLEN; NETWORKS; COSTS; HYMENOPTERA; INTEGRATION	Invasive, alien plants and pollinators have varying effects on their interaction partners, ranging from highly beneficial to strongly detrimental. To understand these contrasting impacts, we review the benefits and costs associated with plant-pollinator interactions and enquire as to how the presence of abundant invaders affects the benefit-cost balance. We provide a conceptual framework that predicts that mutualism shifts to antagonism when invaders increase disproportionally in abundance relative to their interaction partners. This outcome is illustrated by an empirical example of a crop in which flower damage and an associated reduction in fruit quality represent interaction costs of intense visitation by invasive bees. More generally, the extremely high density of invasive flower visitors, such as Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris, might have population- and community-level consequences by hampering reproduction of native plants while promoting reproduction of alien plants. Furthermore, modification of the structure of pollination networks resulting from intense visitation of native plants by superabundant alien flower visitors in highly invaded communities could predict accentuated interaction costs for many native plants. Owing to their high density and the exclusion of native pollinators, invasive bees, originally introduced for honey production and crop pollination, may negatively impact both the native biota and agriculture.

We, therefore, hypothesized that, for plant species with a generalized pollination system, changes in floral orientation would affect the composition of pollinators and their relative contribution to pollination. Geranium refractum, an alpine plant with downward floral orientation was used in this study. We created upward-facing flowers by altering the flower angle. We compared the pollinator diversity, pollination effectiveness, and pollinator importance, as well as female reproductive success between flowers with downward- and upward-facing orientation. Results indicated that the upward-facing flowers were visited by a wider spectrum of pollinators (classified into functional groups), with higher pollinator diversity than natural flowers. Moreover, due to influences on visitation number and pollen removal, the pollinator importance exhibited by the main pollinator groups differed between flower types. Compared with natural flowers, the pollination contribution of principal pollinators (i.e., bumblebees) decreased in upward-facing flowers and other infrequent pollinators, such as solitary bees and muscoid flies, removed more pollen. Consequently, stigmatic pollen loads were lower in upward- than in downward-facing flowers. These findings reveal that floral orientation may affect the level of generalization of a pollination system and the relative importance of diverse pollinators. In this species, the natural downward-facing floral orientation may increase pollen transfer by effective pollinators and reduce interference by inferior pollinators.

Floral neighborhood influences pollinator assemblages and effective pollination in a native plant	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Pollinator visitation; Honeybees; Invasive species; Native bees; Pollinator effectiveness	BRASSICA-NIGRA; HONEY-BEES; FLOWER CONSTANCY; MIMULUS-RINGENS; FORAGING RANGES; COMPETITION; COMMUNITY; MUTUALISMS; EFFICIENCY; DIVERSITY	Pollinators represent an important intermediary by which different plant species can influence each other's reproductive fitness. Floral neighbors can modify the quantity of pollinator visits to a focal species but may also influence the composition of visitor assemblages that plants receive leading to potential changes in the average effectiveness of floral visits. We explored how the heterospecific floral neighborhood (abundance of native and non-native heterospecific plants within 2 m x 2 m) affects pollinator visitation and composition of pollinator assemblages for a native plant, Phacelia parryi. The relative effectiveness of different insect visitors was also assessed to interpret the potential effects on plant fitness of shifts in pollinator assemblage composition. Although the common non-native Brassica nigra did not have a significant effect on overall pollinator visitation rate to P. parryi, the proportion of flower visits that were made by native pollinators increased with increasing abundance of heterospecific plant species in the floral neighborhood other than B. nigra. Furthermore, native pollinators deposited twice as many P. parryi pollen grains per visit as did the nonnative Apis mellifera, and visits by native bees also resulted in more seeds than visits by A. mellifera. These results indicate that the floral neighborhood can influence the composition of pollinator assemblages that visit a native plant and that changes in local flower communities have the potential to affect plant reproductive success through shifts in these assemblages towards less effective pollinators.

The presence of semi-natural areas favorable to pollination is a key factor for achieving this objective of sustainability. Sowing mixtures of dicotyledonous plants that are rich in pollen and nectar as flower strips along field margins is an efficient solution to attract pollinators and to support their foraging activity on arable land. The enhancement of agroecosystems requires operational methods that make it possible to assess the impact of existing and sown semi-natural areas on pollination. We developed here a new predictive indicator that can be used at the field margin and floral levels, which predicts the pollination value of floral diversity and abundance of field margins on arable land. We based the predictive indicator on decision trees using "if-then" linguistic rules because of the lack of sufficient quantitative knowledge about the relationships between floral traits and pollination. This approach makes it possible to use quantitative and qualitative information. We associated fuzzy subsets to the decision trees and the classes of variables in order to avoid the knife-edge effect of class limits. At the species level, the indicator depends on three criteria: (i) visual attractiveness in terms of flower size, color and UV reflection; (ii) flower accessibility according to the botanical family, the symmetry and the shape of the flower; and (iii) the reward linked to pollen and nectar quantity and quality. An aggregation procedure allows us to obtain a value at the field margin level for each month as a function of the flowering period and pollination activity. Examples of calculations for honeybees, wild bees, bumblebees and hoverflies are shown. The evaluation of the predictive quality yielded significant correlations between pollinator abundance and the indicator value. The level of correlation is satisfying for this type of indicator, which might be further improved with additional data on plant traits. Coupling this indicator with a model that assesses the impact of management on plant diversity and abundance will be a further step to help agronomists who work on the improvement of arable farming management in order to lower its negative impact on pollination.

Pollinator assemblages on dandelions and white clover in urban and suburban lawns	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION			English	Article						Urbanization; Pollinators; Bees; Lawns; White clover; Dandelion	BUMBLE BEES BOMBUS; TURF; CONSERVATION; HYMENOPTERA; PATTERNS; ABUNDANCE; DECLINES; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; NECTAR	Flowering weeds, though often deemed undesirable in turfgrass lawns, provide food resources for declining pollinator populations in urbanized landscapes. We sampled bees and other pollinators directly from flowering common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and white clover (Trifolium repens) in lawns of similar character in central Kentucky USA to identify species likely to be exposed if such weeds are inadvertently oversprayed during application of lawn insecticides. We also tested the hypothesis that pollinator assemblages visiting spring-blooming white clover in urban and suburban lawns are as species-rich and diverse as in more rural lawn settings. We collected about 50 different species of insect pollinators, including 37 species of bees, from the aforementioned lawn weeds. Two of the six species of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) collected are considered uncommon and possibly in decline. Hover flies (Syrphidae), honey bees (Apis mellifera), and non-Apid wild bees predominated on dandelions whereas proportionately fewer hover flies and more A. mellifera and Bombus spp. visited white clover, especially in summer. Species richness of bees visiting white clover was similar in urban, suburban or periurban-rural lawns, although A. mellifera were proportionately more abundant, and Bombus spp. were less abundant, with increasing percentage of hardscape in surrounding areas. Fostering public awareness of the diversity of bees and other pollinators that visit flowering lawn weeds might help nurture a sociocultural shift toward more pollinator-friendly lawn care practices.

Widespread occurrence of honey bee pathogens in solitary bees	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Pathogens; Honey bees; Lake Sinai Virus; Crithidia mellificae; Apis mellifera Filamentous Virus	APIS; PARASITE; HYMENOPTERA; BUMBLEBEES; PROTOZOA; BOMBUS	Solitary bees and honey bees from a neighbouring apiary were screened for a broad set of putative pathogens including protists, fungi, spiroplasmas and viruses. Most sampled bees appeared to be infected with multiple parasites. Interestingly, viruses exclusively known from honey bees such as Apis mellifera Filamentous Virus and Varroa destructor Macula-like Virus were also discovered in solitary bees. A microsporidium found in Andrena vaga showed most resemblance to Nosema thomsoni. Our results suggest that bee hives represent a putative source of pathogens for other pollinators. Similarly, solitary bees may act as a reservoir of honey bee pathogens. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Estimating the cost of different strategies for measuring farmland biodiversity: Evidence from a Europe-wide field evaluation	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Indicators; Monitoring; Volunteers; Citizen science; Agriculture	CONSERVATION; INDICATORS; SCALE; MANAGEMENT; CHALLENGE; HABITATS; LESSONS; NEEDS	Forty percent of the EU land area is currently considered to be agriculturally managed (utilised agricultural area - UAA - Eurostat Agricultural Census 2010), and attention to the environmental performance of farming practices is growing. To determine the performance of agricultural practices, farm-scale monitoring programmes are required but their implementation is hampered by a number of difficulties such as the identification of broadly applicable indicators appropriate for different biogeographic locations, and the evaluation of the effectiveness and costs of different monitoring approaches. In this paper, we focus on the costs of farm-scale biodiversity monitoring, presenting results from a Europe-wide cost data collection in the EU FP7 BioBio Project. Firstly, we present an analytical assessment of resources consumed by the research units and a cost estimation for the measurement of six biodiversity-related parameters: farm habitats, vegetation, wild bees and bumblebees, spiders, earthworms and farm management. Thereafter, we estimate a standardised cost for an ordinary measurement of the six parameters at farm-scale. In doing so, we highlight the cost differences between three strategies involving different potential actors (professional agencies, farmers, volunteers). This analysis demonstrates that producing reliable data on monitoring costs requires a large sample pool of farms and farm types, as was the case in the BioBio project. The cost standardisation allowed us to estimate a cost for biodiversity monitoring ranging between (sic)2700 and (sic)8200 per farm, depending on the chosen strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Norfolk, O; Gilbert, F				Norfolk, Olivia; Gilbert, Francis			Insect visitation rates to wild flowers increase in the presence of arid agriculture in South Sinai, Egypt	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Agriculture; Arid; Egypt; Insect; Plant; Pollinator; Seed set; Visitation	BIODIVERSITY; POLLINATION; COFFEE; BEES; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; SYSTEM	In temperate and tropical environments agricultural intensification has primarily negative consequences for pollinator conservation. However, in arid environments agriculture is often highly dependent on irrigation and farms can offer higher availability of floral resources than the external environment. This study compares floral visitation rates to wild plants inside and outside 40 agricultural gardens in South Sinai, Egypt. The mean number of flower visitors per plant during a 30 min focal watch was significantly higher inside the gardens than outside, and this was true of orders Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. In total, 23 insect families were recorded inside the garden and 17 outside. The average family richness per plant was significantly higher inside the gardens, with higher rates of family accumulation across focal plants. Pollinating insects (hoverflies, solitary bees and honeybees) all had higher visitation rates inside the gardens. Seed set was assessed for two common pollinator-dependent plants, Stachys aegyptiaca and Alkanna orientalis. Neither species showed a significant difference in the seed set achieved inside and outside of the gardens, but S. aegyptiaca produced a higher number of seeds per plant inside the gardens because plants tended to be larger. In contrast to many other studies, the presence of agriculture appears to increase the abundance and diversity of flower visitors in this under-studied system, with no negative effect on the seed set of two common wild species.

For this purpose honeybees and bumblebees are reared and transported. A pathogen-free status of bees in general, is crucial. Indeed anthropogenic transports of hosts carrying parasites could alter the natural host/pathogen association, inducing an extra pathogenic stress. Therefore the creation of a pathogen-free rearing environment is needed. For bumblebees this is possible, as these species are reared in a closed environment. Although, a link remains between reared bumblebees and the outside bee community, as honeybee-collected pollen is essential food for bumblebee mass rearing. Here we evaluated if gamma irradiation can minimize the risk of this potential route of exposure and can inactivate viral particles present in honeybee-collected pollen. We show that 16.9 kGy gamma irradiation induced a 100-1000 fold reduction on the ability of IAPV to cause mortality after injections. This result opens avenues toward rearing pathogen-free bumblebees and towards eliminating the risks of pathogen spillover to native wild bee species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Age-mediated and environmentally mediated brain and behavior plasticity in the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						native stingless bee; walking behavior; mushroombody; native pollinator	DIVISION-OF-LABOR; HONEY-BEE; MUSHROOM BODIES; DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; MINI-BRAIN; EXPERIENCE; VOLUME; STIMULATION; MATURATION	Structural changes in the insect brain related to age and individual experience may underlie the behavioral plasticity that is particularly important in such social insects as bees. This study assessed the influence of age and rearing conditions (field vs laboratory) in mediating changes in the volume of mushroom bodies and antennal lobes in the brains of workers of the native stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides Lepeletier, a pollinator species with small colonies exhibiting high level of sociability and behavioral versatility. Although only age-dependent enlargement was observed in the antennal lobes, significant increase (21 %) in the neuropils of the mushroom bodies occurred before the foraging age, in contrast to honeybees, and environmental complexity led to a significant increase in both the mushroom body volume and the walking activity. Such differences in the stingless bee M. quadrifasciata anthidioides as compared with the honeybee may assist in relating brain evolution and plasticity with the behavior in these social insects.

Our results showed that the susceptibility varied significantly with the type of exposure (ingestion, topical, or contact), and there were significant differences between species. While M. quadrifasciata was usually more susceptible to insecticides (except for abamectin) in realistic exposures (via ingestion and contact) than A. mellifera, the former was less susceptible than A. mellifera to topically applied insecticides, a less realistic means of insecticide exposure. These findings challenge the common extrapolation of toxicity bioassays with A. mellifera to all (native) bee pollinators. Such equivocated extrapolation may compromise the significant services provided by native bees in Neotropical ecosystems.

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Epipactis palustris (L.) Crantz that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2. Epipactis palustris is native to Britain, being widely distributed throughout England and Wales, but is less common in the north. Although absent from most of Scotland, it occurs as far north as Perthshire. It is widely distributed in Ireland. The species extends throughout most of Europe, occurring as far east as Mongolia and the north of Turkey, but it is absent from the southern Mediterranean region. 3. Epipactis palustris grows mainly in full sunlight, rarely under shade, and on calcareous, but nutrient-poor, moist to wet substrates. It favours flushed or seasonally inundated areas in which the intensity of competition from other vegetation is low. It is most commonly found in wet dune slacks, calcareous fens and on peat, but it also occurs on sandy substrates overlying heavy clay or loamy soils. Occasionally, it can also be found near the top of slopes in chalk downland. 4. Epipactis palustris multiplies both by vegetative propagation and sexual reproduction. Vegetative propagation involves the production of regularly branched rhizomes. It flowers in Britain from the end of June until the beginning of September. The flowers produce nectar, which is often colonized by bacteria and to a lesser extent by yeasts. The species is pollinated by a wide range of insects, including honeybees, flies, wasps, beetles, bumblebees and ants, but is also capable of limited spontaneous autogamy. The most efficient pollinators are small bees and solitary wasps. Fruit production is generally high (>80% of the flowers produce capsules). 5. Epipactis palustris is vulnerable to changes in soil water level and to substrate nutrient enrichment. It has suffered a strong decline in its distribution range in Britain, with most losses of local populations occurring before 1930. Habitat destruction and drainage of marshes and fens appear to be the most common causes for the decline of the species. Restoration of old wet dune slacks by topsoil removal and addition of hay from neighbouring vegetation has been successful in encouraging colonization and establishment of populations of the species within a few years. Cessation of draining of mires may also promote the long-term survival of populations of the species.

J	Xie, Z; An, J				Xie, Z.; An, J.			The effects of landscape on bumblebees to ensure crop pollination in the highland agricultural ecosystems in China	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Asian honey bee; pollination service; pollinator crisis; pollinator efficacy; visit density	HONEY-BEE; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; APIS-MELLIFERA; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; SERVICES; DISTANCE; SIZE	Honey bees and wild bees provide critical pollination services to agricultural ecosystems; however, the relative contributions of different bee taxa are not well understood. The natural habitats surrounding farmland support food and nesting resources for wild bees and therefore play an important role in the maintenance of crop pollination. In this study, we selected Cucurbita pepo L. (squash) as a model crop to investigate the relative importance of honey bees and bumblebees in pollinating the crop. Thirteen fields, which were surrounded by a gradient of natural habitat, were investigated on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in China. We measured the visit densities of honey bees and bumblebees, the number of pollen grains deposited in a single visit by the two bee taxa, as well as the overall pollen grains deposited on stigmas during a flowering day, and then used Bayesian inference to decouple the pollen grains deposited by either the honey bees or the bumblebees. Compared with honey bees, bumblebees deposited a higher number of pollen grains on stigmas in a single visit, but had a lower visit density than honey bees. Meanwhile, the bumblebee visit density increased along the proportion of natural habitat, while the honey bee visit density was not affected by the surrounding natural habitat. Data simulations using Bayesian inference showed that on a flowering day, the number of pollen grains deposited by bumblebees increased with the proportion of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape, but the number of pollen grains deposited by honey bees did not. Moreover, the total numbers of pollen grains deposited by honey bees or bumblebees alone were all below 2000 (the critical level to satisfy the pollination requirement of this crop). Pollen calculations demonstrated that the number of pollen grains deposited by the two bee taxa was greater than 2000 in fields surrounded by more than 13% natural habitat (grasslands and forests). The results revealed that bumblebees ensured C. pepo pollination in combination with honey bees in the highland agricultural ecosystems.

They are infamous for their high mortality after injection in honeybees. These viruses have also been reported in non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators such as bumblebees, which got infected with IAPV when placed in the same greenhouse with IAPV infected honeybee hives. Here we orally infected Bombus terrestris workers with different doses of either IAPV or KBV viral particles. The success of the infection was established by analysis of the bumblebees after the impact studies: 50 days after infection. Doses of 0.5 x 10(7) and 1 x 10(7) virus particles per bee were infectious over this period, for IAPV and KBV respectively, while a dose of 0.5 x 10(6) IAPV particles per bee was not infectious. The impact of virus infection was studied in micro-colonies consisting of 5 bumblebees, one of which becomes a pseudo-queen which proceeds to lay unfertilized (drone) eggs. The impact parameters studied were: the establishment of a laying pseudo-queen, the timing of egg-laying, the number of drones produced, the weight of these drones and worker mortality. In this setup KBV infection resulted in a significant slower colony startup and offspring production, while only the latter can be reported for IAPV. Neither virus increased worker mortality, at the oral doses used. We recommend further studies on how these viruses transmit between different pollinator species. It is also vital to understand how viral prevalence can affect wild bee populations because disturbance of the natural host-virus association may deteriorate the already critically endangered status of many bumblebee species.

Decadal trends in the pollinator assemblage of Eucryphia cordifolia in Chilean rainforests	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Bipartite networks; Exotic species; Hymenopterans; Nested community; Parasites; Ulmo	WORLDWIDE MIGRATION; CHILOE ISLAND; HONEY-BEE; HYMENOPTERA; BUMBLEBEES; COMMERCIALIZATION; CONSERVATION; MUTUALISMS; PATHOGEN; DYNAMICS	Long-term studies of plant-pollinator interactions are almost nonexistent in the scientific literature. The objective of the present study was to determine changes and trends in the pollinator assemblage of ulmo (Eucryphia cordifolia; Cunoniaceae), a canopy-emergent tree found in Chilean temperate rainforests. We assessed the temporal variability of the pollinator assemblage and identified possible modulators of the observed temporal shifts. We sampled insect visitors to the flowers of 16 individual trees of E. cordifolia during 10 consecutive flowering seasons (2000-2009), recording a total of 137 pollinator species with a mean number of species per year of 44. Only three pollinator species (2.2 %) were recorded every year. Two bee species accounted for 50 % of all insect visits to flowers. One bee species, Bombus dahlbomii (native), was dominant in one season, whereas Apis mellifera (exotic) dominated during the next season. These interannual shifts in population abundances presented first-order dynamics that were characterized by oscillations with a period of 2 years. Changes in the abundances of the dominant pollinators, as well as differences in temperature and precipitation during insect emergence and flowering, led to a nested temporal structure of pollinator composition. Furthermore, the abundances of less common pollinators were sensitive to the abundance of the dominant bee species and to monthly maximum temperatures and the average precipitation during spring and summer. Based on our results and those from other studies, we predict a decline in the numbers of Bombus dahlbomii and nondominant native pollinators in response to new exotic arrivals.

The accompanying non-native parasites may also threaten native bees. We report new observations of the commercially used Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus, 1758) using trapping data and sporadic samples identified with a PCR RFLP-method for degraded DNA. A total of 863 individuals (355 queens, 442 workers, 66 drones) of Bombus sensu stricto were collected during the years 2008-9, of which, 642 were B. lucorum, ten B. cryptaruin, four B. terrestris and none were B. magnus. Three trap types were compared in two modified transects near areas that use the commercial B. terrestris for pollination in Southern Finland: the tree trap that was hung at approximately 3 metres height was the most effective. Regular monitoring is important in the risk assessment of B. terrestris, and for correct species identification, molecular methods are recommended.

J	Leonhardt, SD; Kaltenpoth, M				Leonhardt, Sara D.; Kaltenpoth, Martin			Microbial Communities of Three Sympatric Australian Stingless Bee Species	PLOS ONE			English	Article							APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; CROP POLLINATION; GUT MICROBIOTA; ACID BACTERIA; BUMBLE-BEES; DIVERSITY; POLLEN; IDENTIFICATION; SYMBIONTS	Bacterial symbionts of insects have received increasing attention due to their prominent role in nutrient acquisition and defense. In social bees, symbiotic bacteria can maintain colony homeostasis and fitness, and the loss or alteration of the bacterial community may be associated with the ongoing bee decline observed worldwide. However, analyses of microbiota associated with bees have been largely confined to the social honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus spec.), revealing - among other taxa - host-specific lactic acid bacteria (LAB, genus Lactobacillus) that are not found in solitary bees. Here, we characterized the microbiota of three Australian stingless bee species (Apidae: Meliponini) of two phylogenetically distant genera (Tetragonula and Austroplebeia). Besides common plant bacteria, we find LAB in all three species, showing that LAB are shared by honeybees, bumblebees and stingless bees across geographical regions. However, while LAB of the honeybee-associated Firm4-5 clusters were present in Tetragonula, they were lacking in Austroplebeia. Instead, we found a novel clade of likely host-specific LAB in all three Australian stingless bee species which forms a sister clade to a large cluster of Halictidae-associated lactobacilli. Our findings indicate both a phylogenetic and geographical signal of host-specific LAB in stingless bees and highlight stingless bees as an interesting group to investigate the evolutionary history of the bee-LAB association.

J	Hopfenmuller, S; Steffan-Dewenter, I; Holzschuh, A				Hopfenmueller, Sebastian; Steffan-Dewenter, Ingolf; Holzschuh, Andrea			Trait-Specific Responses of Wild Bee Communities to Landscape Composition, Configuration and Local Factors	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HABITAT AREA; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRUIT-SET; CONNECTIVITY; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; POLLINATORS; RESOURCES; RICHNESS	Land-use intensification and loss of semi-natural habitats have induced a severe decline of bee diversity in agricultural landscapes. Semi-natural habitats like calcareous grasslands are among the most important bee habitats in central Europe, but they are threatened by decreasing habitat area and quality, and by homogenization of the surrounding landscape affecting both landscape composition and configuration. In this study we tested the importance of habitat area, quality and connectivity as well as landscape composition and configuration on wild bees in calcareous grasslands. We made detailed trait-specific analyses as bees with different traits might differ in their response to the tested factors. Species richness and abundance of wild bees were surveyed on 23 calcareous grassland patches in Southern Germany with independent gradients in local and landscape factors. Total wild bee richness was positively affected by complex landscape configuration, large habitat area and high habitat quality (i.e. steep slopes). Cuckoo bee richness was positively affected by complex landscape configuration and large habitat area whereas habitat specialists were only affected by the local factors habitat area and habitat quality. Small social generalists were positively influenced by habitat area whereas large social generalists (bumblebees) were positively affected by landscape composition (high percentage of semi-natural habitats). Our results emphasize a strong dependence of habitat specialists on local habitat characteristics, whereas cuckoo bees and bumblebees are more likely affected by the surrounding landscape. We conclude that a combination of large high-quality patches and heterogeneous landscapes maintains high bee species richness and communities with diverse trait composition. Such diverse communities might stabilize pollination services provided to crops and wild plants on local and landscape scales.

The relationship between managed bees and the prevalence of parasites in bumblebees	PEERJ			English	Article						Pathogen spillover; Pollinator conservation; Commercial bumblebee production; Honeybee	DEFORMED-WING-VIRUS; NOSEMA-CERANAE; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEE; PATHOGEN SPILLOVER; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; WILD POLLINATORS; COLONY COLLAPSE; HYMENOPTERA	Honey bees and, more recently, bumblebees have been domesticated and are now managed commercially primarily for crop pollination, mixing with wild pollinators during foraging on shared flower resources. There is mounting evidence that managed honey bees or commercially produced bumblebees may affect the health of wild pollinators such as bumblebees by increasing competition for resources and the prevalence of parasites in wild bees. Here we screened 764 bumblebees from around five greenhouses that either used commercially produced bumblebees or did not, as well as bumblebees from 10 colonies placed at two sites either close to or far from a honey bee apiary, for the parasites Apicystis bombi, Crithidia bombi, Nosema bombi, N. ceranae, N. apis and deformed wing virus. We found that A. bombi and C. bombi were more prevalent around greenhouses using commercially produced bumblebees, while C. bombi was 18% more prevalent in bumblebees at the site near to the honey bee apiary than those at the site far from the apiary. Whilst these results are from only a limited number of sites, they support previous reports of parasite spillover from commercially produced bumblebees to wild bumblebees, and suggest that the impact of stress from competing with managed bees or the vectoring of parasites by them on parasite prevalence in wild bees needs further investigation. It appears increasingly likely that the use of managed bees comes at a cost of increased parasites in wild bumblebees, which is not only a concern for bumblebee conservation, but which may impact other pollinators as well.

Genomics and host specialization of honey bee and bumble bee gut symbionts	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						bacterial genomics; strain variation; symbiosis	GEN. NOV.; LACTOBACILLUS-REUTERI; VI SECRETION; IV PILI; MICROBIOTA; COLONIZE; BACTERIA; ENTEROBACTERIALES; IDENTIFICATION; DIVERSITY	Gilliamella apicola and Snodgrassella alvi are dominant members of the honey bee (Apis spp.) and bumble bee (Bombus spp.) gut microbiota. We generated complete genomes of the type strains G. apicola wkB1(T) and S. alvi wkB2(T) (isolated from Apis), as well as draft genomes for four other strains from Bombus. G. apicola and S. alvi were found to occupy very different metabolic niches: The former is a saccharolytic fermenter, whereas the latter is an oxidizer of carboxylic acids. Together, they may form a syntrophic network for partitioning of metabolic resources. Both species possessed numerous genes [type 6 secretion systems, repeats in toxin (RTX) toxins, RHS proteins, adhesins, and type IV pili] that likely mediate cell-cell interactions and gut colonization. Variation in these genes could account for the host fidelity of strains observed in previous phylogenetic studies. Here, we also show the first experimental evidence, to our knowledge, for this specificity in vivo: Strains of S. alvi were able to colonize their native bee host but not bees of another genus. Consistent with specific, long-term host association, comparative genomic analysis revealed a deep divergence and little or no gene flow between Apis and Bombus gut symbionts. However, within a host type (Apis or Bombus), we detected signs of horizontal gene transfer between G. apicola and S. alvi, demonstrating the importance of the broader gut community in shaping the evolution of any one member. Our results show that host specificity is likely driven by multiple factors, including direct host-microbe interactions, microbe-microbe interactions, and social transmission.

Field inventories of bee on cotton flowers were performed in the states of Bahia and Mato Grosso, and in Distrito Federal, Brazil. During a 344 hour sampling, 3,470 bees from 74 species were recovered, at eight sites. Apis mellifera dominated the bee assemblages at all sites. Sampling at two sites that received no insecticide application was sufficient to identify the three most common and geographically widespread wild species: Paratrigona lineata, Melissoptila cnecomola, and Trigona spinipes, which could be useful indicators of pollination services in the ERA. Indirect ordination of common wild species revealed that insecticides reduced the number of native bee species and that interannual variation in bee assemblages may be low. Accumulation curves of rare bee species did not saturate, as expected in tropical and megadiverse regions. Species-based approaches are limited to analyze negative impacts of GM cotton on pollinator biological diversity. The accumulation rate of rare bee species, however, may be useful for evaluating possible negative effects of GM cotton on bee diversity.

Quadrat Method for Assessing the Population Abundance of a Commercially Managed Native Soil-Nesting Bee, Nomia melanderi (Hymenoptera: Halictidae), in Proximity to Alfalfa Seed Production in the Western United States	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						pollinator; population; regression		Alkali bees, Nomia melanderi Cockerell, are solitary, gregarious, soil-nesting bees native to the western United States that are commercially managed in the Walla Walla Valley of Washington State to provide pollination service on alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., produced as a seed crop. In 2010 and 2011, we compared two techniques for estimating N. melanderi abundance in commercially managed bee beds. The first technique involved quantifying the abundance of emergence holes in 24 0.5-m(2) quadrats on the surface of 13 bee beds during the peak period of N. melanderi foraging activity in July of both years. When we counted emergence holes, we marked a subset of eight quadrats per bee bed with plastic tabs. Subsequently, in late October of the same year, 0.014-m(3) soil cores were collected in close proximity to the plastic tabs. The soil cores were teased apart in the laboratory and the absolute abundance of overwintering prepupae was quantified per core. Simple regression was highly significant between the means of emergence holes within the 0.5-m(2) soil surface quadrats and the means of the counts from the 0.014-m(3) soil cores. Using mean emergence hole counts, mean prepupae counts from the soil cores, and the surface area of the bee beds, we were able to calculate the estimated abundance of N. melanderi in each bee bed. We conclude that the nondestructive quadrat method of sampling N. melanderi abundance in commercially managed beds is robust compared with the destructive, labor-intensive, absolute soil core method.

J	Pitts-Singer, TL; Cane, JH; Trostle, G				Pitts-Singer, Theresa L.; Cane, James H.; Trostle, Glen			Progeny of Osmia lignaria from distinct regions differ in developmental phenology and survival under a common thermal regime	JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Almond pollination; Blue orchard bee; Developmental physiology; Megachilidae; Osmia lignaria; Phenology	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; PROPINQUA CRESSON; FIELD EXPERIMENTS; EMERGENCE TIME; APPLE ORCHARDS; SOLITARY BEE; HYMENOPTERA; MEGACHILIDAE; TEMPERATURE	Many insects, including some bees, have extensive subcontinental distributions that can differ in climatic conditions. Within and beyond these distributions, humans intentionally transport beneficial insects, including bees, to non-natal geographic locations. Insects also are experiencing unprecedented climatic change in their resident localities. For solitary bees, we know very little about the adaptive plasticity and geographic variation in developmental physiology that accommodates the different climates experienced within distributional ranges. Osmia lignaria Say (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is a widely distributed North American spring-emerging bee being developed as a managed pollinator for tree fruit crops, including almonds. We examined the development and survival of O. lignaria progeny that were descended from populations sourced from southern California, western Washington, and northern Utah, and then were reared together under an hourly and weekly temperature regime simulating those of a California almond-growing region. We found that developmental physiologies of Washington and Utah progeny were generally similar. However, California progeny developed slower, were more metabolically active, and survived better under California conditions than did populations native to regions at higher latitudes. Regardless of geographic origin, cocooned adults managed under prescribed thermal regimes emerged faster and lived longer after wintering. Progeny of parents from different regions exhibited some acclimatory plasticity in developmental phenologies to a novel climatic regime, but overall their responses reflected their geographic origins. This outcome is consistent with their developmental phenologies being largely heritable adaptations to regional climates. (C) Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Bumble bees exhibit daily behavioral patterns in pollen foraging	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Bombus impatiens; Daily phenology; Foraging preferences; Native bee conservation; Pollination ecology	POLLINATION SERVICES; CROP POLLINATION; BOMBUS-IMPATIENS; GENUS SENNA; HONEY-BEES; NECTAR; FLOWER; WILD; CONSEQUENCES; HYMENOPTERA	In response to global declines in bee populations, several studies have focused on floral resource provisioning schemes to support bee communities and maintain their pollination services. Optimizing host-plant selection for supplemental floral provisioning requires an understanding of bee foraging behavior and preferences for host-plant species. However, fully characterizing these preferences is challenging due to multiple factors influencing foraging, including the large degree of spatiotemporal variability in floral resources. To understand bee pollen foraging patterns, we developed a highly controlled mechanistic framework to measure pollen foraging preferences of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to nine plant species native to Pennsylvania. We recorded continuous observations of foraging behavior of the experimental bee community and individual bees, while simultaneously standardizing for the number of foragers in the environment and differences in floral display of each plant species, while controlling for flowering phenology such that bees only foraged when all plant species' flowers were open. Our results demonstrate that B. impatiens exhibit predictable daily patterns in their pollen foraging choices, and their preferences are dominated by the host-plants they visit first. We hypothesize that these patterns at the community and individual levels are driven by the interplay between pollen abundance and quality. We recommend that daily cycles of host-plant visitation be considered in future studies to ensure precise and accurate interpretations of host-plant preference. Such precision is critical for comprehensive analyses of the proximate and ultimate mechanisms driving bee foraging behavior and the selection of host-plant species to use in habitat restoration protocols.

The type of biofuel crop selected for production has the capacity to substantially alter landscape composition, affecting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. To understand how increasing production of perennial grasses for biofuels may affect pollinators and pollination services, we identified 20 agricultural fields that varied in their proportion of surrounding grassland cover. Bees and pollination services were measured at each site to determine how bee abundance, diversity, and community composition responded to increasing proportions of grassland, and to quantify how pollination services changed as the proportion of grassland increased in the landscape. Bees were collected from sentinel sunflowers, and pollination services were measured by comparing seed set from open and closed sunflowers at each site. Landscape composition had a significant effect on bee abundance, diversity, and community composition with a greater abundance of bees and a more diverse bee community found visiting flowers at sites with more of the surrounding landscape in perennial grassland. In contrast, the bee community in low grassland sites was dominated by Apis mellifera, suggesting that pollination in these landscapes may be more sensitive to declines in this species. Despite these differences, the level of sunflower pollination was similar across sites, even though the bee community responded to changes in landscape composition. Increasing grassland cover through the addition of perennial biofuel plantings would be expected to support a more diverse bee community and a greater abundance of bees, yielding reliable pollination services.

Pollination services from wild insects contribute to crop productivity around the world, but are at risk of decline in agricultural landscapes. Using highbush blueberry as a model system, we tested whether wildflower plantings established adjacent to crop fields would increase the abundance of wild pollinators during crop bloom and enhance pollination and yield. 2. Plantings were seeded in 2009 with a mix of 15 perennial wildflower species that provided season-long bloom and increased plant density and floral area during the subsequent 3 years. 3. Honeybees visiting blueberry flowers had similar abundance in enhanced and control fields in all 4 years of this study, whereas wild bee and syrphid abundance increased annually in the fields adjacent to wildflower plantings. 4. Crop pollination parameters including percentage fruit set, berry weight and mature seeds per berry were significantly greater in fields adjacent to wildflower plantings 3 and 4 years after seeding, leading to higher crop yields and with the associated revenue exceeding the cost of wildflower establishment and maintenance. 5. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that provision of forage habitat for bees adjacent to pollinator-dependent crops can conserve wild pollinators in otherwise resource-poor agricultural landscapes. Over time, these plantings can support higher crop yields and bring a return on the initial investment in wildflower seed and planting establishment, also insuring against loss of managed pollinators. Further understanding of the importance of planting size, location and landscape context will be required to effectively implement this practice to support crop pollination.

Imidacloprid Alters Foraging and Decreases Bee Avoidance of Predators	PLOS ONE			English	Article							APIS-MELLIFERA; LEARNING PERFORMANCES; HONEY-BEES; PESTICIDES; HYMENOPTERA; CERANA; DELTAMETHRIN; TOXICITY; DECLINES; EXPOSURE	Concern is growing over the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides, which can impair honey bee cognition. We provide the first demonstration that sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid can harm honey bee decision-making about danger by significantly increasing the probability of a bee visiting a dangerous food source. Apis cerana is a native bee that is an important pollinator of agricultural crops and native plants in Asia. When foraging on nectar containing 40 mu g/L (34 ppb) imidacloprid, honey bees (Apis cerana) showed no aversion to a feeder with a hornet predator, and 1.8 fold more bees chose the dangerous feeder as compared to control bees. Control bees exhibited significant predator avoidance. We also give the first evidence that foraging by A. cerana workers can be inhibited by sublethal concentrations of the pesticide, imidacloprid, which is widely used in Asia. Compared to bees collecting uncontaminated nectar, 23% fewer foragers returned to collect the nectar with 40 mu g/L imidacloprid. Bees that did return respectively collected 46% and 63% less nectar containing 20 mu g/L and 40 mu g/L imidacloprid. These results suggest that the effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee decision-making and other advanced cognitive functions should be explored. Moreover, research should extend beyond the classic model, the European honey bee (A. mellifera), to other important bee species.

North China is a region of varied geomorphology and vegetation, with plateaus, plains, mountains and deserts, and is part of the greatest hotspot of bumblebee diversity worldwide. We report on a field survey of the bumblebees of North China made between 2005-2012. A sample of 21,636 bumblebee specimens are assigned to 76 species. One older specimen held in London added one more species to this list. Together, these 77 species represent 10 subgenera of the genus Bombus. Seven species are recorded from North China for the first time: B. (St.) distinguendus, B. (Th.) anachoreta, B. (Th.) pseudobaicalensis, B. (Th.) exil, B. (Ps.) campestris, B. (Pr.) infirmus and B. (Ag.) validus. We provide identification keys for both males and females, photographs of the common colour patterns, and distribution maps for all species. We describe variation in local species richness and abundance, and list the food plants used by bumblebees in North China. The most abundant 10 bumblebee species are: B. (Ml.) pyrosoma, B. (Bo.) lantschouensis, B. (Bo.) patagiatus, B. (St.) melanurus, B. (Sb.) sibiricus, B. (Bo.) ignitus, B. (Th.) hedini, B. (Pr.) picipes, B. (Mg.) trifasciatus and B. (Mg.) longipes. Bumblebees are distributed widely within North China, from low elevations near the edge of the North-China plain to high elevations at the edge of the east Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (65 4011 m). The highest species richness is found in meadows of the high elevation east Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and in forests of the Qilianshan mountains in southwestern Gansu. The 337 food plant species recorded here belong to 49 families, showing that bumblebees play an important role in interconnecting agricultural and natural ecosystems in North China.

ORCHIDACEAE; MOTH-POLLINATION; BREEDING SYSTEM; TROPICAL TREES; MATING-SYSTEM; FRUIT-SET; BIRDS	Most non-autogamous orchids rely on either a single, or on a small number of pollinators to set fruit. The nectar-rewarding orchid Brachystele unilateralis and the nectarless and deceit-pollinated Chloraea virescens are restricted to the Southern Andes, where a single native and endemic bumblebee (Bombus dahlbomii) occured until the introduction of honeybees and highly invasive European bumblebees. Here, we describe the floral features, breeding system, pollinator activity and fruiting success of these orchid species. Both are self-compatible but pollinator-dependent, i.e., unable to set fruit and seed in the absence of pollinators. Field observations revealed that most of their current reproductive success is due to the introduced Bombus terrestris, Bombus ruderatus and Apis mellifera bees. The only native pollinator recorded was B. dahlbomii, but this bee was rarely observed due to its steady decline since the introduction of the alien Bombus species. The observed natural fruiting success per inflorescence in both studied species proved to be remarkably high by orchid standards: 83% and 66%, respectively. These results suggest that sexual reproduction in these orchids is not necessarily threatened by the decline of their native pollinator since pollination is successfully achieved by introduced bees. This provides a plausible better outlook for these and other regional, bumblebee-pollinated orchids and raises caution on eventual conservation policies involving the management of these introduced bee species. To our knowledge, this is the first report of native orchid pollinators being effectively replaced by invasive bumblebees and, furthermore, the first description of the pollination biology of a species of Bra chystele.

The effect of proximity to a honeybee apiary on bumblebee colony fitness, development, and performance	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						pollinator ecology; competition; bees; Bombus terrestris; Apis mellifera	BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; SIZE VARIATION; BODY-SIZE; APIS-MELLIFERA; NATIVE BEES; COMPETITION; HYMENOPTERA; APIDAE; PATHOGEN; DECLINE	Competition between managed honeybees and wild pollinators is thought to be a key factor in structuring foraging communities on flowers. The majority of studies have focused on impacts such as floral visitation rates and resource overlap. However, direct measurement of fitness is required to fully assess the impacts of competition. We compared in 2 years the weight and reproductive success of bumblebee colonies located at two sites that were either close to or far from a large honeybee apiary, and which were located in the same landscape and with access to similar floral resources. We found that bumblebee colonies located at the site near the honeybee apiary gained less weight, and produced fewer and smaller queens, in both years than colonies at the site far from the apiary. The ratio of queen weight/size was lower in the colonies near honeybees in 1 year, while males were smaller and offspring sex ratio more male biased in colonies close to honeybees than in those far from honeybees. Proximity to managed honeybee hives was therefore associated with significantly reduced fitness of bumblebee colonies, but studies from many more sites are needed to confirm the effect.

Self-pollination rate and floral-display size in Asclepias syriaca (Common Milkweed) with regard to floral-visitor taxa	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Apis mellifera; Apocynaceae; Bombus; Insect pollinators; Asclepias syriaca; Floral-display size; Geitonogamy; Mating system; Self-pollination rate	POLLEN-DONATION HYPOTHESIS; NECTAR PRODUCTION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NATURAL-POPULATION; FRUIT-SET; PLANT; CONSEQUENCES; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; EXALTATA	Background: Animals fertilize thousands of angiosperm species whose floral-display sizes can significantly influence pollinator behavior and plant reproductive success. Many studies have measured the interactions among pollinator behavior, floral-display size, and plant reproductive success, but few studies have been able to separate the effects of pollinator behavior and post-pollination processes on angiosperm sexual reproduction. In this study, we utilized the highly self-incompatible pollinium-pollination system of Asclepias syriaca (Common Milkweed) to quantify how insect visitors influenced male reproductive success measured as pollen removal, female reproductive success measured as pollen deposition, and self-pollination rate. We also determined how floral-display size impacts both visitor behavior and self-pollination rate. Results: Four insect taxonomic orders visited A. syriaca: Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera. We focused on three groups of visitor taxa within two orders (Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera) with sample sizes large enough for quantitative analysis: Apis mellifera (Western Honey Bee), Bombus spp. (bumble bees) and lepidopterans (butterflies and moths). Qualitatively, lepidopterans had the highest pollinator importance values, but the large variability in the lepidopteran data precluded meaningful interpretation of much of their behavior. The introduced A. mellifera was the most effective and most important diurnal pollinator with regard to both pollen removal and pollen deposition. However, when considering the self-incompatibility of A. syriaca, A. mellifera was not the most important pollinator because of its high self-pollination rate as compared to Bombus spp. Additionally, the rate of self-pollination increased more rapidly with the number of flowers per inflorescence in A. mellifera than in the native Bombus spp. Conclusions: Apis mellifera's high rate of self-pollination may have significant negative effects on both male and female reproductive successes in A. syriaca, causing different selection on floral-display size than native pollinators.

To date, the impacts of multilevel spatial structure on pollination services have rarely been addressed. We focused on the effects of population spatial structure on the pollination services of Comarum palustre at three levels (i.e. within-population, between-populations and landscape). For three years, we investigated 14 Belgian populations, which differed in their within-population flower density, population surface, closure (i.e. proportion of the population edge that consisted of woody elements) and isolation (i.e. percentage of woody area cover within a 500 m radius from the population centre). We tested whether these spatial characteristics impact on pollinator abundance and visitation rate and thus, reproductive success of C. palustre. Insects were observed in 15 randomly-chosen plots in each population. We tested for pollen limitation with supplemental hand-cross pollination. Bumble bees and solitary bees were the major pollinators through all populations. Within populations, plots with high flower densities attracted high numbers of bumble bees and other insects. High bumble bee and solitary bee abundance was observed in populations presenting high proportions of woody edges and in populations within landscapes presenting high proportions of woody areas. Seed set resulting from open pollination varied with bumble bee and solitary bee visitation rate, leading to increased pollen limitation when pollinators were scarce. Since the reproductive success depended on the visitation rate of the main pollinators, which depended on multilevel spatial structure, wetland management plans should pay special attention to favour a mosaic of biotopes, including nesting sites and food resources for insects. This study particularly supports the relevance of a mix wetlands and woody habitats to bees.

In total, 233 bee species were recorded. Bee forage plants visited by the honey bee and wild Apiformes are listed for each refuge habitat. Species composition is given for individual habitats, including fields of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), oilseed rape (Brassica napus), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), and radish (Raphanus sativus). Species richness and dominance structure of bee communities in the 2 regions are compared, and species responsible for significant differences are identified.

Potential Pollinators of Tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum (Solanaceae), in Open Crops and the Effect of a Solitary Bee in Fruit Set and Quality	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						tomato; Exomalopsis analis; Cerrado; buzz pollination; behavior	MELIPONA-QUADRIFASCIATA HYMENOPTERA; GREENHOUSE TOMATOES; NANNOTRIGONA-PERILAMPOIDES; SPECIES RICHNESS; APIDAE; BOMBUS; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; VIBRATION; ECOSYSTEM	We identified native bees that are floral visitors and potential pollinators of tomato in Cerrado areas, described the foraging behavior of these species, and verified the influence of the visitation of a solitary bee on the quantity and quality of fruits. Three areas of tomato crops, located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, were sampled between March and November 2012. We collected 185 bees belonging to 13 species. Exomalopsis (Exomalopsis) analis Spinola, 1853 (Hymenoptera: Apidae) was the most abundant. Ten species performed buzz pollination. Apis mellifera L. 1758 (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Paratrigona lineata (Lepeletier, 1836) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) could also act as pollinators. The fruit set and number of seeds obtained from the pollination treatment by E. analis were higher than those in the control group. Our results allowed the identification of potential tomato pollinators in Cerrado areas and also contributed information regarding the impact of a single species (E. analis) on fruit set and quality. Although most of the visiting bees show the ability for tomato pollination, there is an absence of adequate management techniques, and its usage is difficult with the aim of increasing the crop production, which is the case for E. analis. Species such as Melipona quinquefasciata, P. lineata, and A. mellifera, which are easy to handle, are not used for pollination services. Finally, it is suggested that a combination of different bee species that are able to pollinate the tomato is necessary to prevent the super-exploitation of only a single species for pollination services and to guarantee the occurrence of potential pollinators in the crop area.

Pollen Loads and Specificity of Native Pollinators of Lowbush Blueberry	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						lowbush blueberry; native pollinator; pollen transportation; Vaccinium angustifolium	BEES HYMENOPTERA; HONEYBEES; ABUNDANCE; DECLINES; APOIDEA	The reproduction of lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) is closely tied to insect pollination, owing to self-incompatibility. Many species are known to have greater pollination efficiency than the introduced Apis mellifera L., commonly used for commercial purposes. In this study, we measured the pollen loads of several antophilous insect species, mostly Apoidea and Syrphidae, present in four lowbush blueberry fields in Lac-St-Jean, Quebec. To measure pollen loads and species specificity toward V. angustifolium, we net-collected 627 specimens of pollinators, retrieved their pollen loads, identified pollen taxa, and counted pollen grains. We found that the sizes of pollen loads were highly variable among species, ranging from a few hundred to more than 118,000 pollen grains per individual. Bombus and Andrena species in particular carried large amounts of Vaccinium pollen and thus may have greater pollination efficiency. Also, two species (Andrena bradleyi Viereck and Andrena carolina Viereck) showed nearly monolectic behavior toward lowbush blueberry. Finally, we identified alternative forage plants visited by native pollinators, notably species of Acer, Rubus, Ilex mucronata, Ledum groenlandicum, and Taraxacum. Protecting these flowering plants should be part of management practices to maintain healthy pollinator communities in a lowbush blueberry agroecosystem.

In Saudi Arabia, morphometric analysis using 24 characteristics separated the Saudi honey bee between two reference subspecies. Most Saudi honey bee samples clustered with Apis mellifera jemenitica reference group, but others were more similar to Apis mellifera litorea reference group. Based on sequence analysis of the mtDNA COI-COII region, 18 new and clearly separated haplotypes were characterized for the first time. Sequence analyses showed that most haplotypes belonged to the O lineage and are very close to the Syrian haplotypes found in the gene databank (NCBI). However, two other haplotypes belonged to the A lineage and are clearly different from the Ethiopian haplotypes previously described as A.m. jemenitica. However, no previous genetic data for the A.m. jemenitica from Saudi Arabia, Yemen or Oman are available in the databank for comparison purposes. Additionally, this high genetic diversity in the mtDNA COI-COII region and the clear morphometric variation suggest that the honey bee of Saudi Arabia represents more than one distinct honey bee subspecies.

Bee Species Diversity Enhances Productivity and Stability in a Perennial Crop	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGHBUSH BLUEBERRY; HABROPODA-LABORIOSA; BUMBLE BEES; RESPONSE DIVERSITY; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; PLANT DIVERSITY; APIS-MELLIFERA; NATIVE BEES; HONEY-BEES; FRUIT-SET	Wild bees provide important pollination services to agroecoystems, but the mechanisms which underlie their contribution to ecosystem functioning-and, therefore, their importance in maintaining and enhancing these services-remain unclear. We evaluated several mechanisms through which wild bees contribute to crop productivity, the stability of pollinator visitation, and the efficiency of individual pollinators in a highly bee-pollination dependent plant, highbush blueberry. We surveyed the bee community (through transect sampling and pan trapping) and measured pollination of both open-and singly-visited flowers. We found that the abundance of managed honey bees, Apis mellifera, and wild-bee richness were equally important in describing resulting open pollination. Wild-bee richness was a better predictor of pollination than wild-bee abundance. We also found evidence suggesting pollinator visitation (and subsequent pollination) are stabilized through the differential response of bee taxa to weather (i.e., response diversity). Variation in the individual visit efficiency of A. mellifera and the southeastern blueberry bee, Habropoda laboriosa, a wild specialist, was not associated with changes in the pollinator community. Our findings add to a growing literature that diverse pollinator communities provide more stable and productive ecosystem services.

Nectar Minerals as Regulators of Flower Visitation in Stingless Bees and Nectar Hoarding Wasps	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Avocado; Nannotrigona perilampoides; Phosphorus; Pollination; Polybia; Potassium; Trigona (=Frieseomelitta) nigra; Hymenoptera; Apoidea; Vespoidea	APIS-MELLIFERA L; PERSEA-AMERICANA; FLORAL NECTARS; HONEY-BEES; TOXIC NECTAR; POTASSIUM CONCENTRATIONS; ONION FLOWERS; HYMENOPTERA; APIDAE; PLANT	Various nectar components have a repellent effect on flower visitors, and their adaptive advantages for the plant are not well understood. Persea americana (avocado) is an example of a plant that secretes nectar with repellent components. It was demonstrated that the mineral constituents of this nectar, mainly potassium and phosphate, are concentrated enough to repel honey bees, Apis mellifera, a pollinator often used for commercial avocado pollination. Honey bees, however, are not the natural pollinator of P. americana, a plant native to Central America. In order to understand the role of nectar minerals in plant-pollinator relationships, it is important to focus on the plant's interactions with its natural pollinators. Two species of stingless bees and one species of social wasp, all native to the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, part of the natural range of P. americana, were tested for their sensitivity to sugar solutions enriched with potassium and phosphate, and compared with the sensitivity of honey bees. In choice tests between control and mineral-enriched solutions, all three native species were indifferent for mineral concentrations lower than those naturally occurring in P. americana nectar. Repellence was expressed at concentrations near or exceeding natural concentrations. The threshold point at which native pollinators showed repellence to increasing levels of minerals was higher than that detected for honey bees. The results do not support the hypothesis that high mineral content is attractive for native Hymenopteran pollinators; nevertheless, nectar mineral composition may still have a role in regulating flower visitors through different levels of repellency.

Although the type of bioenergy crop and its associated management is likely to affect biodiversity at the local (field) scale, landscape context and its interaction with crop type may also influence biodiversity on farms. In this study, we assessed the impact of replacing conventional agricultural crops with two model bioenergy crops (either oilseed rape Brassica napus or Miscanthusxgiganteus) on vascular plant, bumblebee, solitary bee, hoverfly and carabid beetle richness, diversity and abundance in 50 sites in Ireland. We assessed whether within-field biodiversity was also related to surrounding landscape structure. We found that local- and landscape-scale variables correlated with biodiversity in these agricultural landscapes. Overall, the differences between the bioenergy crops and the conventional crops on farmland biodiversity were mostly positive (e.g. higher vascular plant richness in Miscanthus planted on former conventional tillage, higher solitary bee abundance and richness in Miscanthus and oilseed rape compared with conventional crops) or neutral (e.g. no differences between crop types for hoverflies and bumblebees). We showed that these crop type effects were independent of (i.e. no interactions with) the surrounding landscape composition and configuration. However, surrounding landscape context did relate to biodiversity in these farms, negatively for carabid beetles and positively for hoverflies. Although we conclude that the bioenergy crops compared favourably with conventional crops in terms of biodiversity of the taxa studied at the field scale, the effects of large-scale planting in these landscapes could result in very different impacts. Maintaining ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services will require a greater understanding of impacts at the landscape scale to ensure the sustainable development of climate change mitigation measures.

Sublethal pesticide exposure negatively impacts numerous pollinator life-history traits, but its influence on reproductive success remains largely unknown. Such information is pivotal, however, to our understanding of the long-term effects on population dynamics. We investigated the influence of field-realistic trace residues of the routinely used neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin in nectar substitutes on the entire life-time fitness performance of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. We show that chronic, dietary neonicotinoid exposure has severe detrimental effects on solitary bee reproductive output. Neonicotinoids did not affect adult bee mortality; however, monitoring of fully controlled experimental populations revealed that sublethal exposure resulted in almost 50% reduced total offspring production and a significantly male-biased offspring sex ratio. Our data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that sublethal neonicotinoid effects on non-Apis pollinators are expressed most strongly in a rather complex, fitness-related context. Consequently, to fully mitigate long-term impacts on pollinator population dynamics, present pesticide risk assessments need to be expanded to include whole life-cycle fitness estimates, as demonstrated in the present study using O. bicornis as a model.

Insect Visitors and Pollination Ecology of Spalding's Catchfly (Silene spaldingii) in the Zumwalt Prairie of Northeastern Oregon	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						bumble bees; native bees; pollinators; Silene spaldingii; Spalding's catchfly; Zumwalt Prairie Preserve	BOMBUS LATR HYMENOPTERA; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; BUNCHGRASS PRAIRIE; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; SOUTHERN ALBERTA; SEED PREDATION; BEES; CARYOPHYLLACEAE; CONSEQUENCES; METAANALYSIS	Silene spaldingii S. Watson (Spalding's catchfly) is a threatened wildflower that relies on insect-mediated pollination. However, its pollination ecology is not well understood, particularly in the Zumwalt Prairie of northeastern Oregon, which contains the largest known S. spaldingii population. Our objectives were to: (1) describe the principal insect visitors to S. spaldingii in the Zumwalt Prairie, (2) quantify the available pool of pollinators in the area, and (3) determine whether the visitation rate to individual plants is associated with the density of S. spaldingii at the patch scale, as predicted by the resource concentration hypothesis, and/or by the density and composition of non-S. spaldingii blooming plants, as predicted by the facilitation and competition hypotheses. We recorded insect visits to S. spaldingii during peak bloom at 30 patches and characterized the local bee community using blue vane traps. We quantified the patch-scale density of S. spaldingii and the composition and abundance of other blooming species at each patch. Two bumble bee species comprised all observed visits, although they constituted only 20% of the total bees sampled on the prairie. Bumble bees showed a high degree of host fidelity even when other blooming plants were present. Per capita visitation rates increased with catchfly density and blooming plant abundance at the patch scale, supporting the resource concentration and facilitation hypotheses. Silene spaldingii in the Zumwalt Prairie appears to rely on a narrow pool of pollinators that may preferentially visit it over other blooming plants, and more dense patches of S. spaldingii may increase pollination efficiency.

J	Ali, M; Saeed, S; Sajjad, A; Bashir, MA				Ali, Mudssar; Saeed, Shafqat; Sajjad, Asif; Bashir, Muhammad Amjad			Exploring the Best Native Pollinators for Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) Production in Punjab, Pakistan	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Pumpkin; staminate and pistillate flowers; effective pollinators; single visit efficacy	PEPONAPIS-PRUINOSA HYMENOPTERA; BEE APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEE; POLLEN DISPERSAL; SQUASH BEE; VISITATION; APIDAE; L.; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY	Pollination in pumpkin (Cucrubita pepo) largely depends on activity of native insect pollinators, especially the bees. In order to explore the pollinator diversity and the best native pollinators for pumpkin production, an experiment was performed at the research farm of the Faculty of. Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan. The visitation frequency of the bees across staminate and pistillate flowers, pattern of diurnal and seasonal visitation, efficiency in harvesting and depositing pollen and resultant fruit set per single visit were evaluated. The insect pollinator community was composed of la species in 3 orders and 6 families. Nomia sp., Apis dorsata and Halictus sp. were among the most abundant (189, 399, 117 respectively) and efficient pollinators in terms of number of pollen grains harvested (3121.50 +/- 199.54; 2090.40 +/- 139.03, 798.45 +/- 109.39, respectively) and deposited (376.60 +/- 23.01, 204.15 +/- 20.63, 177.85 +/- 16.31, respectively). The single visit fruit set percentage also revealed Nomia sp. (36.66) as the best pollinator followed by the A. dorsata (23.33) and Halictus sp. (20.0). Conserving and enhancing these bee species may boost pumpkin production in Pakistan.

Hille Ris			Neighborhood-contingent indirect interactions between native and exotic plants: multiple shared pollinators mediate reproductive success during invasions	OIKOS			English	Article							NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS; FLORAL NEIGHBORHOOD; POLLEN LIMITATION; ALIEN PLANT; SEED SET; DENSITY; BEHAVIOR; ATTRACTION; VISITATION; DIVERSITY	Native and exotic plants can influence one another's fecundity through their influence on shared pollinators. Specifically, invasion may alter abundance and composition of local floral resources, affecting pollinator visitation and ultimately causing seedset of natives in more-invaded and less-invaded floral neighborhoods to differ. Such pollinator-mediated effects of exotic plants on natives are common, but native and exotic plants often share multiple pollinators, which may differ in their responses to altered floral neighborhoods. We quantified pollinator-mediated interactions between three common forbs of western Washington prairies (native Microseris laciniata and Eriophyllum lanatum and European Hypochaeris radicata) in three floral neighborhoods: 1) high native and low exotic floral density, 2) high exotic floral density and low native density, and 3) experimentally manipulated low exotic floral density. Pollinator visitation rates varied by floral neighborhood, plant species identity, and their interaction for all three plant species. Similarly, pollinator functional groups (eusocial bees, solitary bees, and syrphid flies) contributed differing proportions of total visitation to each species depending upon neighborhood context. Consequently, in exotic neighborhoods H. radicata competed with native M. laciniata, reducing seed set, while simultaneously facilitating visitation and seed set for native E. lanatum. Seed set of H. radicata was also highest in exotic neighborhoods (with high densities of conspecifics), raising the possibility of a positive feedback between exotic abundance and success. Our results suggest that the outcome of indirect interactions between native and exotic plants depends on the density and the composition of the floral neighborhood and of the pollinator fauna, and on context-dependent pollinator foraging.

J	Benvenuti, S				Benvenuti, Stefano			Wildflower green roofs for urban landscaping, ecological sustainability and biodiversity	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Urban ecosystem; Flora; Greening; Wildness; Biophilia; Entomofauna	BUTTERFLY CONSERVATION; ESTABLISHMENT; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS; URBANIZATION; ATTITUDES; PLANTS; PARKS	The aim of this trial was to test a wildflower roof in order to show how a country landscape fits in an urban environment. The bio-agronomic performance, the biodiversity dynamics during the two-years experiment, and the pollinating fauna, were analysed. Each plant group was able to efficiently colonize the surface of the roof though in different periods and with various modalities. Thermal insulation of green roof was connected to different development dynamics of leaf canopies. In particular, this cooling effect took place during the peak of the vegetation's growth pattern. As expected, each plant group had differing flowering periods, during which were observed coincided highest rate of pollinator' visits (domestic and solitary bees, bumblebees, lepidoptera, diptera both syrphidae and bombyliidae). The agronomic management, consisting in senescent vegetation mowing, was of crucial importance to ensure the plant equilibrium of spring and summer flowering species. The lack of a prevailing species was highlighted by several biodiversity indexes. On the contrary, early and late flowering species (geophytes) did not require any vegetation management. In conclusion, even if wildflowers exhibit critical aspects in terms of covering dynamics, due to the periodic senescence of vegetation, they represent a valid instrument to improve the biodiversity and the landscape of the Mediterranean urban ecosystem.

Imperfect Replacement of Native Species by Non-Native Species as Pollinators of Endemic Hawaiian Plants	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						biological invasions; Clermontia; mutualism disruption; novel mutualism; pollinator loss; Zosterops japonicus; Clermontia; disrupcion del mutualismo; invasiones biologicas; mutualismo novel; perdida de polinizadores; Zosterops japonicus	JAPANESE WHITE-EYES; SEED DISPERSAL; EXTINCTION; BIRDS; AVIFAUNA; FLOWERS; MUTUALISMS; LOBELIAD; PATTERNS; ISLAND	Native plant species that have lost their mutualist partners may require non-native pollinators or seed dispersers to maintain reproduction. When natives are highly specialized, however, it appears doubtful that introduced generalists will partner effectively with them. We used visitation observations and pollination treatments (experimental manipulations of pollen transfer) to examine relationships between the introduced, generalist Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) and 3 endemic Hawaiian plant species (Clermontia parviflora, C. montis-loa, and C. hawaiiensis). These plants are characterized by curved, tubular flowers, apparently adapted for pollination by curve-billed Hawaiian honeycreepers. Z. japonicus were responsible for over 80% of visits to flowers of the small-flowered C. parviflora and the midsize-flowered C. montis-loa. Z. japonicus-visited flowers set significantly more seed than did bagged flowers. Z. japonicus also demonstrated the potential to act as an occasional Clermontia seed disperser, although ground-based frugivory by non-native mammals likely dominates seed dispersal. The large-flowered C. hawaiiensis received no visitation by any birds during observations. Unmanipulated and bagged C. hawaiiensis flowers set similar numbers of seeds. Direct examination of Z. japonicus and Clermontia morphologies suggests a mismatch between Z. japonicus bill morphology and C. hawaiiensis flower morphology. In combination, our results suggest that Z. japonicus has established an effective pollination relationship with C. parviflora and C. montis-loa and that the large flowers of C. hawaiiensis preclude effective visitation by Z. japonicus. Remplazo Imperfecto de Especies Nativas por Especies No-Nativas como Polinizadores de Plantas Endemicas de Hawaii Resumen Las especies nativas de plantas que han perdido a sus companeros mutualistas pueden requerir de polinizadores no-nativos o dispersores de semillas para mantener su reproduccion. Sin embargo cuando las especies nativas estan altamente especializadas, parece dudoso que especies generalistas introducidas se acoplaran efectivamente con ellas. Usamos observaciones de visita y tratamientos de polinizacion (manipulaciones experimentales de transferencia de polen) para examinar las relaciones entre la introducida y generalista Zosterops japonicus y tres especies de plantas endemicas de Hawaii (Clermontia parviflora, C. montis-loa y C. hawaiiensis). Estas plantas se caracterizan por sus flores curveadas y tubulares, adaptadas aparentemente a la polinizacion por mieleros hawaianos de pico curvo. Zosterops japonicus fue responsable de mas del 80% de visitas a flores de C. parviflora, de flores pequenas, y de C. montis-loa, de flores mediadas. Las flores visitadas por Zosterops japonicus establecieron significativamente mas semillas que aquellas flores embolsadas. Zosterops japonicus tambien demostro el potencial para fungir como dispersor ocasional de semillas de Clermontia, aunque la frugivoria terrestre de mamiferos no-nativos probablemente domine la dispersion de semillas. C. hawaiiensis, de flores grandes, no fue visitada por aves durante las observaciones. Ejemplares de C. hawaiiensis sin manipular y embolsadas establecieron un numero similar de semillas. La examinacion directa de las morfologias de Z. japonicus y Clermontia sugieren un desajuste entre la morfologia del pico de Z. japonicus y la morfologia floral de C. hawaiiensis. Combinados, nuestros resultados sugieren que Z. japonicus ha establecido una relacion efectiva de polinizacion con C. parviflora y C. montis-loa y que las flores grandes de C. hawaiiensis evitan las visitas efectivas de Z. japonicus.

Yet, there is a concerning global trend of pollinator declines. Parasites and pesticides are among the suspected principle drivers of these declines. However, especially in the case of key wild pollinators, there are insufficient data on the relative impact of these individual environmental stressors and whether they interact to increase detrimental effects. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we investigated how laboratory exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, over a 9-week period and a prevalent trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi affects various crucial colony traits of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We show that chronic dietary exposure from an early stage of colony development to doses of thiamethoxam and clothianidin that could be encountered in the field truncated worker production, reduced worker longevity and decreased overall colony reproductive success. Further, we demonstrate a significant interaction between neonicotinoid exposure and parasite infection on mother queen survival. The fate of the mother queen is intrinsically linked to colony success, and under combined pressure of parasite infection and neonicotinoid exposure, mother queen survival was lowest. This indicates increased detrimental effects of combined exposure on this crucial colony trait. Combined effects may be exacerbated in stressful natural environments where more pronounced parasite virulence is expected. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reiterate that dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can impact on bumblebee colony performance and fitness. The indication of combined negative effects of ecologically relevant pressures suggests additional adverse consequences for long-term population dynamics under complex field conditions. To help safeguard pollinator health, whole life-cycle fitness assessments, particularly for non-Apis bees, stringently incorporating chronic and sublethal side effects of pesticides, as well as interactions with common natural stressors, such as prevalent parasites, should be considered in the corresponding test guidelines.

J	Arena, M; Sgolastra, F				Arena, Maria; Sgolastra, Fabio			A meta-analysis comparing the sensitivity of bees to pesticides	ECOTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Toxicity; Environmental risk assessment; Apis mellifera; Apiformes; Pollinators; Comparative ecotoxicology	APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; INSECTICIDES; TOXICITY; POLLINATORS; HYMENOPTERA; BUMBLEBEES; DECLINES; POLLEN	The honey bee Apis mellifera, the test species used in the current environmental risk assessment procedure, is generally considered as extremely sensitive to pesticides when compared to other bee species, although a quantitative approach for comparing the difference in sensitivity among bees has not yet been reported. A systematic review of the relevant literature on the topic followed by a meta-analysis has been performed. Both the contact and oral acute LD50 and the chronic LC50 reported in laboratory studies for as many substances as possible have been extracted from the papers in order to compare the sensitivity to pesticides of honey bees and other bee species (Apiformes). The sensitivity ratio R between the endpoint for the species a (A. mellifera) and the species s (bees other than A. mellifera) was calculated for a total of 150 case studies including 19 bee species. A ratio higher than 1 indicated that the species s was more sensitive to pesticides than honey bees. The meta-analysis showed a high variability of sensitivity among bee species (R from 0.001 to 2085.7), however, in approximately 95 % of the cases the sensitivity ratio was below 10. The effect of pesticides in domestic and wild bees is dependent on the intrinsic sensitivity of single bee species as well as their specific life cycle, nesting activity and foraging behaviour. Current data indicates a need for more comparative information between honey bees and non-Apis bees as well as separate pesticide risk assessment procedures for non-Apis bees.

Up to 75% of crop species benefit at least to some degree from animal pollination for fruit or seed set and yield. However, basic information on the level of pollinator dependence and pollinator contribution to yield is lacking for many crops. Even less is known about how insect pollination affects crop quality. Given that habitat loss and agricultural intensification are known to decrease pollinator richness and abundance, there is a need to assess the consequences for different components of crop production. Methods. We used pollination exclusion on flowers or inflorescences on a whole plant basis to assess the contribution of insect pollination to crop yield and quality in four flowering crops (spring oilseed rape, field bean, strawberry, and buckwheat) located in four regions of Europe. For each crop, we recorded abundance and species richness of flower visiting insects in ten fields located along a gradient from simple to heterogeneous landscapes. Results. Insect pollination enhanced average crop yield between 18 and 71% depending on the crop. Yield quality was also enhanced in most crops. For instance, oilseed rape had higher oil and lower chlorophyll contents when adequately pollinated, the proportion of empty seeds decreased in buckwheat, and strawberries' commercial grade improved; however, we did not find higher nitrogen content in open pollinated field beans. Complex landscapes had a higher overall species richness of wild pollinators across crops, but visitation rates were only higher in complex landscapes for some crops. On the contrary, the overall yield was consistently enhanced by higher visitation rates, but not by higher pollinator richness. Discussion. For the four crops in this study, there is clear benefit delivered by pollinators on yield quantity and/or quality, but it is not maximized under current agricultural intensification. Honeybees, the most abundant pollinator, might partially compensate the loss of wild pollinators in some areas, but our results suggest the need of landscape-scale actions to enhance wild pollinator populations.

In order to design effective measures to mitigate agricultural impact, simultaneous investigations of different taxonomic groups across several regions are required. Therefore, four contrasting taxonomic groups were investigated: plants, earthworms, spiders and bees (wild bees and bumblebees), which represent different trophic levels and provide different ecological services. To better understand underlying patterns, three community measurements for each taxonomic group were considered: abundance, species richness and species composition. In four European regions, ten potential environmental drivers of the four taxonomic groups were tested and assigned to three groups of drivers: geographic location (farm, region), agricultural management (crop type, mineral nitrogen input, organic nitrogen input, mechanical field operations and pesticide applications) and surrounding landscape in a 250 m buffer zone (diversity of habitats in the surroundings, proportion of arable fields and proportion of non-productive, non-woody habitats). First, the variation in abundance, species richness and species composition from 167 arable sites was partitioned to compare the relative contribution of the three groups of drivers (geographic location, agricultural management and surrounding landscape). Second, generalized linear mixed-effects models were applied to estimate the effect of the individual explanatory variables on abundance and species richness. Our analysis showed a dominant effect of geographic location in all four taxonomic groups and a strong influence of agricultural management on plants, spiders and bees. The effect of the surrounding landscape was of minor importance and inconsistent in our data. We conclude that in European arable fields, the avoidance of mineral nitrogen and pesticides is beneficial for biodiversity, and that species protection measures should take into account regional characteristics and the community structure of the investigated taxonomic groups.

Influence of nesting habitats on the gut enzymes activity and heavy metal composition of Apis mellifera andersonii L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)	AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						worker bees; heavy metal; gut enzymes; nesting habitats		The demand for honey and other beehive products has necessitated different methods of hunting ranging from wild to modern beekeeping methods. The influence of two different nesting habitats on the gut enzyme activities and heavy metal content of honey-bee workers was investigated in this study. Worker bees of Apis mellifera L. were randomly collected from the wild and Kenya top bar hives were analysed for the presence of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn and Cu). Gut enzymes (cellulase, amylase, a-glucosidase, proteinase and lipase) assay was also determined in worker bees from the two habitats. Worker bees from the Kenya top bar hives recorded significantly higher heavy metals in their body than worker bees from the wild. Similarly, no Cd and Pb were detected in the body of worker bees from the wild. The gut enzymes assay of worker bees from Kenya top bar hives revealed the presence of cellulase, amylase, glucosidase, proteinase and lipase with a significantly higher enzymes activities (1.10, 1.65, 0.89, 0.61, 0.23 Absorbance/min for cellulase, amylase, proteinase, lipase and a-glucosidase, respectively) than wild worker bees. It can thus be concluded that nesting habitats influenced workerbees heavy metal composition and gut enzymes.	[Lawal, O. A.; Aina, S. A.; Abiade, A.

Can the pollination biology and floral ontogeny of the threatened Acacia carneorum explain its lack of reproductive success?	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Acacia apis; Pollinator fidelity; Honeybees; Pollinator behaviour; Flowering synchronicity; Invasive species	INTRODUCED HONEYBEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; BEES; BEHAVIOR; BIRDS; FABACEAE; SURVIVAL; INSECTS; DENSITY; SYSTEM	Many Acacia species in arid areas of eastern Australia have been severely impacted by grazing, habitat degradation and fragmentation. These factors have been at the core of proposed explanations for the reproductive failure and numerical decline of Acacia carneorum and other threatened acacias. Paradoxically, the sympatric Acacia ligulata is thriving and highly fecund. Although these species have superficially similar floral displays, differences in sexual reproductive success may reflect interactions between flower and inflorescence ontogeny and pollinator assemblages. We compared the floral biology and flower visitor assemblages of A. carneorum and A. ligulata at four sites per species. Both species displayed similar floral ontogeny and synchronicity of display, with inflorescences simultaneously hermaphroditic for 4-5 days. However, A. ligulata displayed a higher density of flowers than A. carneorum and, while both species received a range of flower visitors, A. ligulata was visited by relatively few species and was serviced primarily by the non-native honeybee Apis mellifera, which typically made many within-plant movements during foraging bouts. In contrast, A. carneorum was visited by a diverse suite of native insects that carried little pollen and made fewer within plant movements. On average, Apis mellifera carried 98.4 % A. ligulata pollen, whereas the native insect visitors of A. carneorum carried only 45 % A. carneorum pollen. Differing floral ontogeny or lack of native pollinators does not explain the reproductive failure of A. carneorum. The success of A. ligulata may reflect pollination services provided by A. mellifera and interactions with plant mating systems.

APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						crop pollination; Lasioglossum malachurum; Lasioglossum politum; pollinator complementarity; intra-inflorescence variation	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; APIS-MELLIFERA; FLOWER NUMBER; SOLITARY BEES; POLLEN; EFFICIENCY; PHENOLOGY; DECLINES	Complementarity between species in the use of flower resources can enhance the pollination services of diverse pollinator communities. To test for complementarity, we studied fine-scale patterns of flower visitation and contribution to seed set of the three locally dominant bee species (commercially managed honeybees and two wild, non-managed Lasioglossum species) visiting confection (non-oil) sunflower in central Israel. The three species differed in their temporal (time of day) and phenological (head bloom stage) visitation patterns but generally showed niche redundancy. Moreover, honeybees strongly outperformed the wild species in both visitation rates and single-visit contributions to seed set. We conclude that the present communities and densities of wild bees do not complement honeybee sunflower pollination in the studied system. Sunflower seed production in central Israel is currently dependent solely upon the high stocking rate and pollination efficiency of honeybees.

Wing wear, but not asymmetry in wear, affects load-lifting capability in bumble bees Bombus impatiens	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						area asymmetry; Bombus impatiens; bumble bee; insect flight; load lifting; wing wear	FLIGHT PERFORMANCE; VERTICAL FORCE; ANIMAL FLIGHT; BODY-MASS; AERODYNAMICS; DAMAGE; HYMENOPTERA; TERRESTRIS; FREQUENCY; APIDAE	Wing wear is widespread in flying insects, but its effects on flight are controversial. In this research, we examine the separate and combined effects of wing area and wing area asymmetry on maximum load-lifting capability in bumble bees Bombus impatiens Cresson, 1863. Individual bees with experimentally induced forewing wear (0%-24% forewing area loss, 0%-38% forewing area asymmetry) were harnessed with a string to which small bead groups were attached and tested in a flight chamber to measure the maximum weight that they could lift incrementally. Wing wear significantly decreased load-lifting ability: the higher the mean wing area loss, the less mass a bee could lift (2.66 mg load reduction per 1% forewing area loss, which represents similar to 1.6% of mean body mass or similar to 5.2% of expected mean nectar load). However, wing area asymmetry, both alone and in combination with area loss, had no detectable effect on maximum lift. The clear cost of wing wear for bumble bees is a linear reduction in weight-lifting capability through loss of wing area. This relatively strong diminution of load lifting by wing wear, observed over the range of wing area losses naturally accrued by wild bees, provides a potential mechanism for declining foraging ability and survivorship of worker bees with wing wear. What remains to be explained is the utter insensitivity of maximum load lifted to forewing asymmetry.

Impacts of a neonicotinoid, neonicotinoid-pyrethroid premix, and anthranilic diamide insecticide on four species of turf-inhabiting beneficial insects	ECOTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Chlorantraniliprole; Clothianidin; Bifenthrin; Synergism; Insecticides; Turfgrass	JAPANESE-BEETLE COLEOPTERA; TIPHIA-VERNALIS HYMENOPTERA; KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS TURF; GOLF-COURSES; TURFGRASS; SCARABAEIDAE; LEPIDOPTERA; PESTICIDES; MANAGEMENT; NOCTUIDAE	Many turf managers prefer to control foliage- and root-feeding pests with the same application, so-called multiple-targeting, using a single broad-spectrum insecticide or a premix product containing two or more active ingredients. We compared the impact of a neonicotinoid (clothianidin), a premix (clothianidin + bifenthrin), and an anthranilic diamide (chlorantraniliprole), the main insecticide classes used for multiple targeting, on four species of beneficial insects: Harpalus pennsylvanicus, an omnivorous ground beetle, Tiphia vernalis, an ectoparasitoid of scarab grubs, Copidosoma bakeri, a polyembryonic endoparasitoid of black cutworms, and Bombus impatiens, a native bumble bee. Ground beetles that ingested food treated with clothianidin or the premix suffered high mortality, as did C. bakeri wasps exposed to dry residues of those insecticides. Exposure to those insecticides on potted turf cores reduced parasitism by T. vernalis. Bumble bee colonies confined to forage on white clover (Trifolium repens L.) in weedy turf that had been treated with clothianidin or the premix had reduced numbers of workers, honey pots, and immature bees. Premix residues incapacitated H. pennsylvanicus and C. bakeri slightly faster than clothianidin alone, but otherwise we detected no synergistic or additive effects. Chlorantraniliprole had no apparent adverse effects on any of the beneficial species. Implications for controlling turf pests with least disruption of non-target invertebrates are discussed.

Disease associations between honeybees and bumblebees as a threat to wild pollinators	NATURE			English	Article							DEFORMED-WING-VIRUS; EMERGING INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; APIS-MELLIFERA; VARROA-DESTRUCTOR; NOSEMA-CERANAE; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; BEES; PATHOGEN; HEALTH; BIODIVERSITY	Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a risk to human welfare, both directly(1) and indirectly, by affecting managed livestock and wildlife that provide valuable resources and ecosystem services, such as the pollination of crops(2). Honeybees (Apis mellifera), the prevailing managed insect crop pollinator, suffer from a range of emerging and exotic high-impact pathogens(3,4), and population maintenance requires active management by beekeepers to control them. Wild pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline(5,6), one cause of which may be pathogen spillover from managed pollinators like honeybees(7,8) or commercial colonies of bumblebees(9). Here we use a combination of infection experiments and landscape-scale field data to show that honeybee EIDs are indeed widespread infectious agents within the pollinator assemblage. The prevalence of deformed wing virus (DWV) and the exotic parasite Nosema ceranae in honeybees and bumblebees is linked; as honeybees have higher DWV prevalence, and sympatric bumblebees and honeybees are infected by the same DWV strains, Apis is the likely source of at least one major EID in wild pollinators. Lessons learned from vertebrates(10,11) highlight the need for increased pathogen control in managed bee species to maintain wild pollinators, as declines in native pollinators may be caused by interspecies pathogen transmission originating from managed pollinators.

This solitary bee is the only representative in the Western Hemisphere of the Old World genus Lithurgus, and likely a conspecific with the Indo-Australian species Lithurgus atratus. L. huberi appears to have reached the continent at least 100 years ago, when it was discovered and described. Because this species seems to be oligolectic on pollen of Convolvulaceae flowers in South America, we attempted to integrate this biotic interaction (plant-bee relationships) to our species distribution model (SDM) procedures to predict its potential distribution in South America. The modeled distribution of seven L. huberi's host plant species did not improve the algorithms' ability to predict its distribution, but it produced constrained ranges. These results suggest that our biotic variables are not independent of the abiotic variables used (mostly related to climate). We employed five modeling algorithms, Envelope Score, GARP, Mahalanobis Distance, Support Vector Machines, and MaxEnt, but only the former two showed a good performance when predicting the occurrence of both, the host plant species and L. huberi. Our results indicate that this exotic pollinator is mainly distributed in eastern, northeastern, central, and southwestern South America, with few suitable areas in the Amazon region. We also highlight suitable areas for future surveys and present new occurrence records. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To verify the use of Eucalyptus spp. in the pollinic diet of Apis mellifera L. and Melipona obscurior Moure, we evaluated the proportion of pollen that both bee species collected from Eucalyptus spp. in relation to the relative abundance of Eucalyptus spp. in the study areas. The study occurred in the localities of Riozinho and Rolante, RS, Brazil, whose land cover was characterized by remote sensing. Every two weeks from April/2009 to March/2010, pollen was collected from foragers of three hives of each bee species for posterior palynological analysis. The median percentage of Eucalyptus spp. pollen collected in Riozinho was 16.3% (0-55.3%; n = 18) for A. mellifera and 2.6% (0-72.3%; n = 15) for M. obscurior. In Rolante, the median was 21.9% (0-66.7%; n = 19) for A. mellifera and 17.6% (0-82.9%; n = 17) for M. obscurior. The difference between these values was significant only when considered the collection period. The index of use was similar for both species and both areas. The attractiveness and availability of flowering Eucalyptus spp. throughout the year allowed both species of bees to use pollen from this genus in both areas, regardless of the landscape characteristics. In southern Brazil, sustainable practices for the management of eucalypts can contribute to the survival of social bees during the periods of lower pollen production by other sources.

Sublethal effects include troubles in learning performance, orientation skills, or mobility, with possible contribution to substantial dysfunction at population scale. However, the study of sublethal effects is currently limited by considerable knowledge gaps, particularly for the numerous pollinators other than the honey bee Apis mellifera L.-the traditional model for pesticide risk assessment in pollinators. Here, we propose to use the crop-emptying time as a rule of thumb to guide the design of oral exposure experiments in the honey bee and wild bees. The administration of contaminated sucrose solutions is typically followed by a fasting time lapse to allow complete assimilation before the behavioral tests. The fasting duration should at least encompass the crop-emptying time, because no absorption takes place in the crop. We assessed crop-emptying rate in fasted bees and how it relates 1) with sucrose solution concentration in the honey bee and 2) with body mass in wild bees. Fasting duration required for complete crop emptying in honey bees fed 20 mu l of a 50% sucrose solution was nearly 2 h. Actual fasting durations are usually shorter in toxicological studies, suggesting incomplete crop emptying, and therefore partial assimilation of experimental solutions that could imply underestimation of sublethal effects. We also found faster crop-emptying rates in large wild bees compared with smaller wild bees, and suggest operative rules to adapt sublethal assessment schemes accordingly.

Effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam at field-realistic levels on microcolonies of Bombus terrestris worker bumble bees	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Bee health; Bombus; Field-realistic; Imidacloprid; Neonicotinoid; Thiamethoxam	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; MYZUS-PERSICAE; INSECT MEMBRANES; COLONY GROWTH; CLOTHIANIDIN; BINDING; CONSERVATION; HYMENOPTERA; DECLINES; EXPOSURE	Neonicotinoid pesticides are currently implicated in the decline of wild bee populations. Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98 mu g kg(-1) in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98 mu g thiamethoxam kg(-1), while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98 mu g kg(-1)). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11 mu g kg(-1)). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood.

Selection of trait combinations through bee and fly visitation to flowers of Polemonium follosissimum	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						correlational selection; flower colour; flower shape; phenotypic manipulation; Polemonium; pollinator effectiveness; pollinator visitation; temporal variation in selection	POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION; PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; FLORAL DISPLAY; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NATURAL-SELECTION; SEED PREDATORS; SPUR LENGTH; COLOR; PLANT; SIZE	Pollinators are known to exert natural selection on floral traits, but the extent to which combinations of floral traits are subject to correlational selection (nonadditive effects of two traits on fitness) is not well understood. Over two years, we used phenotypic manipulations of plant traits to test for effects of flower colour, flower shape and their interaction on rates of pollinator visitation to Polemonium foliosissimum. We also tested for correlational selection based on weighting visitation by the amount of conspecific pollen delivered per visit by each category of insect visitor. Although bumblebees were the presumed pollinators, solitary bees and flies contributed substantially (42%) to pollination. In manipulations of one trait at a time, insects visited flowers presenting the natural colour and shape over flowers manipulated to present artificial mutants with either paler colour or a more open or more tubular flower. When both colour and shape were manipulated in combination, selection on both traits arose, with bumblebees responding mainly to colour and flies responding mainly to shape. Despite selection on both floral traits, in a year with many bumblebees, we saw no evidence for correlational selection of these traits. In a year when flies predominated, fly visitation showed a pattern of correlational selection, but not favouring the natural phenotype, and correlational selection was still not detected for expected pollen receipt. These results show that flower colour and shape are subject to pollinator-mediated selection and that correlational selection can be generated based on pollinator visitation alone, but provide no evidence for correlational selection specifically for the current phenotype.

Relative abundance of an invasive alien plant affects insect-flower interaction networks in Ireland	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bombus; Connectance; Generality; Interaction evenness; Plant invasion; Plant-pollinator networks	ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; RHODODENDRON-PONTICUM L.; POLLINATOR NETWORKS; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; EXOTIC SHRUB; WEB; SPECIALIZATION; ESTABLISHMENT; BIODIVERSITY; METAANALYSIS	1. Invasive alien flowering plants may affect native plant pollinator interactions and have knock on impacts on populations of native plants and animals. The magnitude of these impacts, however, may be modified by the relative abundance of the invasive plant and the number of flowers it presents. 2. We tested this by examining the structure of insect flower interaction networks in six sites with increasing levels of invasion by Rhododendron ponticum in Ireland. 3. Neither flower-visiting insect abundance, species richness nor diversity were related to R. ponticum flower abundance, but the composition of insect communities was. The total number of flowers in a site increased with the relative abundance of R. ponticum flowers but the number of co-flowering native plant species in these sites was low (<6), making interaction networks relatively small. 4. As a result,,changes in interaction network properties (connectance, interaction evenness and network level specialisation), which correlated with R. ponticum flower abundance, were a result of the small network size rather than due to changes in the resilience of networks. 5. Overall, we conclude that the impacts of invasive alien plants on native plant-pollinator interactions are not only species specific, but site specific, according to the abundance of flowers produced by both the invasive and the native plants.

Avoiding a bad apple: Insect pollination enhances fruit quality and economic value	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Apples; Pollination; Economic valuation; Pollinators; Pollination deficit; Apple quality; United Kingdom	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SEED NUMBER; HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; BEES HYMENOPTERA; HONEY-BEES; LANDSCAPES; DECLINES; YIELD; WILD; SET	Insect pollination is important for food production globally and apples are one of the major fruit crops which are reliant on this ecosystem service. It is fundamentally important that the full range of benefits of insect pollination to crop production are understood, if the costs of interventions aiming to enhance pollination are to be compared against the costs of the interventions themselves. Most previous studies have simply assessed the benefits of pollination to crop yield and ignored quality benefits and how these translate through to economic values. In the present study we examine the influence of insect pollination services on farmgate output of two important UK apple varieties; Gala and Cox. Using field experiments, we quantify the influence of insect pollination on yield and importantly quality and whether either may be limited by sub-optimal insect pollination. Using an expanded bioeconomic model we value insect pollination to UK apple production and establish the potential for improvement through pollination service management. We show that insects are essential in the production of both varieties of apple in the UK and contribute a total of 36.7 pound million per annum, over 6 pound million more than the value calculated using more conventional dependence ratio methods. Insect pollination not only affects the quantity of production but can also have marked impacts on the quality of apples, influencing size, shape and effecting their classification for market. These effects are variety specific however. Due to the influence of pollination on both yield and quality in Gala, there is potential for insect pollination services to improve UK output by up to 5.7 pound million per annum. Our research shows that continued pollinator decline could have serious financial implications for the apple industry but there is considerable scope through management of wild pollinators or using managed pollinator augmentation, to improve the quality of production. Furthermore, we show that it is critically important to consider all production parameters including quality, varietal differences and management costs when valuing the pollination service of any crop so investment in pollinator management can be proportional to its contribution.

Agricultural Policies Exacerbate Honeybee Pollination Service Supply-Demand Mismatches Across Europe	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FRUIT-SET; SEQUENTIAL INTRODUCTION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BEES; COLONIES; DECLINES; DENSITY; ENHANCE; BIODIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA	Declines in insect pollinators across Europe have raised concerns about the supply of pollination services to agriculture. Simultaneously, EU agricultural and biofuel policies have encouraged substantial growth in the cultivated area of insect pollinated crops across the continent. Using data from 41 European countries, this study demonstrates that the recommended number of honeybees required to provide crop pollination across Europe has risen 4.9 times as fast as honeybee stocks between 2005 and 2010. Consequently, honeybee stocks were insufficient to supply >90% of demands in 22 countries studied. These findings raise concerns about the capacity of many countries to cope with major losses of wild pollinators and highlight numerous critical gaps in current understanding of pollination service supplies and demands, pointing to a pressing need for further research into this issue.

J	Munyuli, T				Munyuli, Theodore			Influence of functional traits on foraging behaviour and pollination efficiency of wild social and solitary bees visiting coffee (Coffea canephora) flowers in Uganda	GRANA			English	Article						visitation intensity; coffee-banana agroforests; ecological traits; pollination efficiency; pollination speed; Coffea canephora; central Uganda; social bees; fruit set; foraging rate	CROP POLLINATION; SERVICES; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; QUALITY; INCREASES; HABITATS; DISTANCE; ENHANCE	An on-farm pollination experiment was conducted during the June-August and November-February blooming seasons of 2007 to 2008, in 30 small-scale coffee fields characterised by different habitat and vegetation types. The study was conducted in order to determine the best pollinator groups for coffee in Uganda and to collect relevant field information and determine the pollination efficiency of different bee species. Results indicate that across blooming seasons, coffee flowers were visited by 24-36 bee species. Hypotrigona gribodoi was the most frequent flower visitor, comprising over 60% of 5941 bee-visits recorded. Foraging rate and pollination speed varied among bee species. Solitary bees foraged on more flowers than social bees, but they spent less time per flower visited. Solitary bees visited more coffee trees and fields, but deposited less pollen, whereas social bees visited less trees and coffee fields in the landscape, but deposited more pollen on flowers. Fruit set was of 87%, 64% and 0.9%, respectively, in hand-cross pollination, open pollination and controlled-pollination treatments. Fruit abortion due to self-pollination was insignificant in this study. There was variability in pollination efficiency of different bee species. Pollination efficiency varied more significantly with sociality than with other bee functional traits and was not significantly influenced by tongue length and bee body size. Single-flower visits by social and solitary bees resulted in 89.7% and 68.14% fruit set, respectively. The most efficient bee species was Meliponula ferruginea (98.3%) followed by Meliponula nebulata (97.1%). Thus, very good pollinator species were wild social bees (mainly stingless bees) as opposed to honeybees and solitary bees that were previously reported to be the best pollinators of coffee in Panama and Indonesia. Morphological and anatomical characteristics of the bee pollen storage features may explain the difference in foraging behaviour activities and in pollination efficiency of social and solitary afrotropical bee species visiting lowland coffee in Uganda. In addition, pollination efficiency was influenced by land-use intensity, field management systems and habitat types found in the immediate surroundings of coffee fields, but not by coffee field size, coffee genotypes and mass blooming wild vegetation. It is recommended to farmers to adopt pollinator-friendly conservation and farming practices such as keeping an uncultivated portion (25%-30%) of their farms as pollinator reservoirs, protecting semi-natural habitats found in the vicinity of coffee fields, as well as promoting high on-farm tree cover to benefit a functionally diverse pollinator community.

W.; Toldam-Andersen, Torben B.; Eilenberg, Jorgen			An assessment of Osmia rufa (syn. bicornis) as a pollinator of the sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) cv. Stevnsbaer in eastern Denmark	JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Osmia rufa; Prunus cerasus; pollen; foraging	APIS-MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA; CORNUTA LATR; MANAGED POPULATIONS; MEGACHILIDAE; DECLINES; BEHAVIOR; TRENDS; PLANTS; APIDAE; BEES	The sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) cv. Stevnsbaer is self-fertile but it is recommended that bees are placed in the orchards during flowering. The solitary bee Osmia rufa can be managed, and has previously been suggested as an alternative pollinator to Apis mellifera, so consequently, this study investigates the activity and food preferences of this species during flowering of sour cherry (P. cerasus cv. Stevnsbaer). Female O. rufa provisioned a mean of 2.96 +/- 1.44 cells each with 6.24 +/- 1.46 pollen types during the receptive period of flowering. In all 17 different pollen types were collected of which the most dominant were Salix (41.4% +/- 9.34%) and Acer (33.24% +/- 8.81%), followed by Betula (8.16% +/- 5.08%), P. cerasus (8.16% +/- 1.79%) and Fagus (3.56% +/- 1.96%). P. cerasus was present in all samples. Nine pollen types were from anemophilous plants and represented 87.94% of the pollen collected. The remaining 8 pollen types were from entomophilous plants. Based on the results it is estimated that a mean of 220,000 O. rufa cocoons would be needed per hectare if the species were to be an effective, supplementary pollinator of P. cerasus cv. Stevnsbaer. Practical, economic and environmental considerations suggest that the use of O. rufa as an alternative pollinator to A. mellifera in this instance is not realistic.	[Hansted, Lise; Grout, Brian W.

J	Jakobsson, A; Padron, B				Jakobsson, Anna; Padron, Benigno			Does the invasive Lupinus polyphyllus increase pollinator visitation to a native herb through effects on pollinator population sizes?	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Pollination; Wild bees; Flower resources; Seed production; Agricultural landscape	ALIEN PLANT; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; PURPLE LOOSESTRIFE; CROP POLLINATION; CARPOBROTUS SPP.; POLLEN TRANSFER; COLONY GROWTH; BEES; DENSITIES	Invasive plants may compete with native species for abiotic factors as light, space and nutrients, and have also been shown to affect native pollination interactions. Studies have mainly focused on how invasive plants affect pollinator behaviour, i.e. attraction of pollinators to or away from native flowers. However, when an invasive plant provides resources utilized by native pollinators this could increase pollinator population sizes and thereby pollination success in natives. Effects mediated through changes in pollinator population sizes have been largely ignored in previous studies, and the dominance of negative interactions suggested by meta-analyses may therefore be biased. We investigated the impact of the invasive Lupinus polyphyllus on pollination in the native Lotus corniculatus using a study design comparing invaded and uninvaded sites before and after the flowering period of the invasive. We monitored wild bee abundance in transects, and visit rate and seed production of potted Lotus plants. Bumblebee abundance increased 3.9 times in invaded sites during the study period, whereas it was unaltered in uninvaded sites. Total visit rate per Lotus plant increased 2.1 times in invaded sites and decreased 4.4 times in uninvaded sites. No corresponding change in seed production of Lotus was found. The increase in visit rate to Lotus was driven by an increase in solitary bee visitation, whereas mainly bumblebees were observed to visit the invasive Lupinus. The mechanism by which the invasive increases pollinator visit rates to Lotus could be increased availability of other flower resources for solitary bees when bumblebees forage on Lupinus.

Pollen obtained from the forager bees during a period of 12 months showed that the richness of pollen types found in each sample varied from 5 to 21 for A. mellifera and from 1 to 10 for M. obscurior. In both areas, A. mellifera had higher niche breadth. M. obscurior demonstrated the temporal specialization, which was primarily related to the use of floral sources with poricidal anthers. The non-native pollen type Eucalyptus produced similar results for both bee species. Knowledge of plant species that sustain bee communities in the Atlantic rain forest of southern Brazil contributes toward the management and conservation of native bee populations and increases the beekeeping of stingless bees and honey bees in this region.

Island honey bee populations are particularly appropriate to test the impact of the introduction of foreign subspecies into their genetic diversity and structure. Here we have used microsatellite markers to evaluate the temporal genetic variation over the last decade in Macaronesian honey bee populations, which have been exposed to different beekeeping strategies regarding queen importation as previously revealed by mitochondrial determination of the evolutionary lineage: a high level on Tenerife and Sao Miguel and absent or low on La Palma and Madeira. While genetic diversity remained low (from 0.402 to 0.483 in the previous survey and from 0.390 to 0.513 in the current survey), genetic introgression from foreign honey bees was detected on Tenerife and So Miguel based on Bayesian structure analysis. Nevertheless, the existence of endemic honey bee populations deserving conservation on the Macaronesian Islands can still be inferred from the aforementioned analyses.

Previous studies have suggested that populations of introduced European honeybee (Apis mellifera) and bumblebee species (Bombus terrestris and Bombus ruderatus) in Argentina share the neogregarine parasite Apicystis bombi with the native bumblebee (Bombus dahlbomii). In this study we investigated whether A. bombi is acting as an emergent parasite in the non-native populations. Specifically, we asked whether A. bombi, recently identified in Argentina, was introduced by European, non-native bees. Using ITS1 and ITS2 to assess the parasite's intraspecific genetic variation in bees from Argentina and Europe, we found a largely unstructured parasite population, with only 15% of the genetic variation being explained by geographic location. The most abundant haplotype in Argentina (found in all 9 specimens of non-native species) was identical to the most abundant haplotype in Europe (found in 6 out of 8 specimens). Similarly, there was no evidence of structuring by host species, with this factor explaining only 17% of the genetic variation. Interestingly, parasites in native Bombus ephippiatus from Mexico were genetically distant from the Argentine and European samples, suggesting that sufficient variability does exist in the ITS region to identify continent-level genetic structure in the parasite. Thus, the data suggest that A. bombi from Argentina and Europe share a common, relatively recent origin. Although our data did not provide information on the direction of transfer, the absence of genetic structure across space and host species suggests that A. bombi may be acting as an emergent infectious disease across bee taxa and continents.

J	Jha, S; Stefanovich, L; Kremen, C				Jha, Shalene; Stefanovich, Lev; Kremen, Claire			Bumble bee pollen use and preference across spatial scales in human-altered landscapes	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						agriculture; ecosystem service; foraging behaviour; pollinator; resource dynamics	PROVIDING FORAGING RESOURCES; AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; CROP POLLINATION; COLONY GROWTH; NEST DENSITY; LAND-USE; DIET BREADTH; SOLITARY BEE; HABITAT USE	While the discussion of native pollinator decline has grown dramatically worldwide, information on how native pollinators utilise floral resources in natural and human-altered landscapes remains relatively limited. Specifically, little is known about the collection of pollen, an essential component of larval and adult bee food, and whether pollen collection patterns change across habitats, spatial scales, and/or native and non-native floral resource distributions. In this study, the pollen collection patterns and preferences of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, were examined across a gradient of natural and human-altered sites. Three hypotheses were investigated: (i) landscape-scale (2km) but not local-scale (250m) floral and habitat composition factors are most predictive of bee-collected pollen composition; (ii) collection of native pollen is greater in sites with greater proportions of natural habitat at landscape scales; and (iii) bees exhibit greater preference' for native versus non-native pollen.Bombus vosnesenskii collected more species of pollen when landscape-scale riparian forest cover was low but local- and landscape-scale floral species richness was high. Also, B.vosnesenskii collected pollen from a wide range of plant families and did not exhibit a significant preference for native versus non-native species. Finally, preference analysis indicated that the only significant preference exhibited by B.vosnesenskii during the study period was for Heteromeles arbutifolia, a native shrub. Overall, results from this study reveal the importance of species-rich floral patches (native and non-native) for pollinator provisioning across natural and human-altered landscapes.

We aimed to assess the impact of oilseed rape on the pollination of wild plants and bee abundance during and after oilseed-rape bloom, including effects on crop-noncrop spillover at landscape and adjacent-field scales. We focused on two shrub species (hawthorn Crataegus spp., dog rose Rosa canina) and adjacent herb flowering in forest edges, connected hedges, and isolated hedges in Lower Saxony, Germany. We selected 35 landscape circles of 1 km radius, differing in the amount of oilseed rape; 18 were adjacent to oilseed rape and 17 to cereal fields, and we quantified bee density via pan traps at all sites. Adjacent oilseed rape positively affected fruit mass and seed number per fruit of simultaneously flowering hawthorn (no effect on dog rose, which flowers after the oilseed rape bloom). At the landscape scale, oilseed rape had a negative effect on bumble bee density in the hedges during flowering due to dilution of pollinators per unit area and the consequently intensified competition between oilseed rape and wild shrubs, but a positive effect after flowering when bees moved to the hedges, which still provided resources. In contrast, positive landscape-scale effects of oilseed rape were found throughout the season in forest edges, suggesting that edges support nesting activity and enhanced food resources. Our results show that oilseed rape effects on bee abundances and pollination success in seminatural habitats depend on the spatial and temporal scale considered and on the habitat type, the wild plant species, and the time of crop flowering. These scale-dependent positive and negative effects should be considered in evaluations of landscape-scale configuration and composition of crops. Food resources provided by mass-flowering crops should be most beneficial for landscape-wide enhancement of wild bee populations if seminatural habitats are available, providing (1) nesting resources and (2) continuous flowering resources during the season.

J	Sasaki, K; Nagao, T				Sasaki, Ken; Nagao, Takashi			Juvenile hormone-dopamine systems for the promotion of flight activity in males of the large carpenter bee Xylocopa appendiculata	NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN			English	Article						Biogenic amine; Dopamine; Flight; Hymenoptera; Juvenile hormone	APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; MECHANISMS; WORKERS	The reproductive roles of dopamine and dopamine regulation systems are known in social hymenopterans, but the knowledge on the regulation systems in solitary species is still needed. To test the possibility that juvenile hormone (JH) and brain dopamine interact to trigger territorial flight behavior in males of a solitary bee species, the effects on biogenic amines of JH analog treatments and behavioral assays with dopamine injections in males of the large carpenter bee Xylocopa appendiculata were quantified. Brain dopamine levels were significantly higher in methoprene-treated males than in control males 4 days after treatment, but were not significantly different after 7 days. Brain octopamine and serotonin levels did not differ between methoprene-treated and control males at 4 and 7 days after treatment. Injection of dopamine caused significantly higher locomotor activities and a shorter duration for flight initiation in experimental versus control males. These results suggest that brain dopamine can be regulated by JH and enhances flight activities in males. The JH-dopamine system in males of this solitary bee species is similar to that of males of the highly eusocial honeybee Apis mellifera.

Rapid ecological replacement of a native bumble bee by invasive species	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; CONSERVATION	Despite rising global concerns over the potential impacts of non-native bumble bee (Bombus spp) introductions on native species, large-scale and long-term assessments of the consequences of such introductions are lacking. Bombus ruderatus and Bombus terrestris were sequentially introduced into Chile and later entered Argentina's Patagonian region. A large-scale survey in Patagonia reveals that, in 5 years post-arrival, the highly invasive B terrestris has become the most abundant and widespread Bombus species, and its southward spread is concurrent with the geographic retraction of the only native species, Bombus dahlbomii. Furthermore, a 20-year survey of pollinators of the endemic herb Alstroemeria aurea in northern Patagonia indicates that B ruderatus and B terrestris have replaced B dahlbomii, formerly the most abundant pollinator. Although the decline's underlying mechanisms remain unknown, the potential roles of exploitative competition and pathogen co-introduction cannot be ruled out. Given that invasive bumble bees can rapidly extirpate native congeners, further introductions should be discouraged.

Pollinators and pollination of oilseed rape crops (Brassica napus L.) in Ireland: ecological and economic incentives for pollinator conservation	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION			English	Article						Valuation of ecosystem services; Bombus; Bioenergy crops; Oilseed crops; Pollinator dependent crops; Agroecology; Crop pollination; Agriculture; Mass-flowering crops	BEE ABUNDANCE; FRUIT-SET; DIVERSITY; LANDSCAPES; SERVICES; HONEYBEE; CANOLA; PLANTS; YIELD; HYMENOPTERA	Pollinators are beneficial for many wild and crop plants. As a mass-flowering crop, oilseed rape has received much focus in terms of its pollination requirements but despite a threefold increase in area of cultivation of this crop in Ireland over the past 5 years, little is known about its pollination here. We surveyed the flower visiting insects found in commercial winter oilseed rape fields and evaluated the importance of different pollinator groups, investigated the contribution of insect pollination to oilseed rape seed production, and estimated the economic value of insect pollination to the crop at a national level. Our data showed that winter oilseed rape is visited by a wide variety of insect species, including the honeybee, bumblebees, solitary bees, and hoverflies. The honeybee, Eristalis hoverflies and bumblebees (especially Bombus sensu stricto and B. lapidarius) were the best pollinators of winter oilseed rape based on the number of pollen grains they carry, visitation rates per flower and their relative abundance per field. Exclusion of pollinators resulted in a 27 % decrease in the number of seeds produced, and a 30 % decrease in seed weight per pod in winter crops, with comparable values from a spring oilseed rape field also. The economic value of insect pollination to winter oilseed rape was estimated as a,not sign2.6 million per annum, while the contribution to spring oilseed rape was a,not sign1.3 million, resulting in an overall value of a,not sign3.9 million per annum. We can suggest the appropriate conservation and management of both honeybees and wild pollinators in agricultural areas to ensure continued provision of pollination services to oilseed rape, as a decrease in insect numbers has the potential to negatively influence crop yields.

J	Hudewenz, A; Klein, AM				Hudewenz, Anika; Klein, Alexandra-Maria			Competition between honey bees and wild bees and the role of nesting resources in a nature reserve	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION			English	Article						Andrena fuscipes; Colletes succinctus; Apis mellifera; Heriades truncorum; Heath	FORAGING BUMBLEBEES; APIS-MELLIFERA; FLOWERS; SCENT; LANDSCAPE; RESPONSES; HABITAT	The European honey bee exploits floral resources efficiently and may therefore compete with solitary wild bees. Hence, conservationists and bee keepers are debating about the consequences of beekeeping for the conservation of wild bees in nature reserves. We observed flower-visiting bees on flowers of Calluna vulgaris in sites differing in the distance to the next honey-bee hive and in sites with hives present and absent in the Luneburger Heath, Germany. Additionally, we counted wild bee ground nests in sites that differ in their distance to the next hive and wild bee stem nests and stem-nesting bee species in sites with hives present and absent. We did not observe fewer honey bees or higher wild bee flower visits in sites with different distances to the next hive (up to 1,229 m). However, wild bees visited fewer flowers and honey bee visits increased in sites containing honey-bee hives and in sites containing honey-bee hives we found fewer stem-nesting bee species. The reproductive success, measured as number of nests, was not affected by distance to honey-bee hives or their presence but by availability and characteristics of nesting resources. Our results suggest that beekeeping in the Luneburg Heath can affect the conservation of stem-nesting bee species richness but not the overall reproduction either of stem-nesting or of ground-nesting bees. Future experiments need control sites with larger distances than 500 m to hives. Until more information is available, conservation efforts should forgo to enhance honey bee stocking rates but enhance the availability of nesting resources.

Higher soybean production using honeybee and wild pollinators, a sustainable alternative to pesticides and autopollination	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Apis mellifera; Biotic pollination; Pesticides; Crop pollination; Crop productivity; Glycine max; Native pollinators; Pollination deficit; Supplementary pollination; Yield increment	GLYCINE-MAX L.; FRUIT-SET; BEES	This is the first report showing that using honeybee (Apis mellifera) and wild pollinators complementary pollination can enhance soybean productivity (Glycine max). Current industrial production of soybean involves autopollination and high loads of pesticides. Therefore, growers have neglected possible biotic pollination despite suggestions that soybean benefit from insect pollinators. Reports advocating possible biotic pollination are based on experiments where bees are caged with flowering plants and the absence of pesticides, thus not in field conditions. Therefore, here we compared in field conditions soybean yield produced (1) independently of biotic pollinators, (2) with wild pollinators and (3) with honeybee colonies. Results showed an increase of +6.34 % of soybean yield in areas where wild pollinators had free access to flowers. The introduction of honeybee colonies further raised the yield of +18.09 %. Our findings therefore show that, though soybean is autogamous, allowing pollination by wild pollinators leads to higher yields. Moreover, adding honeybee mitigates pollination deficits and improves yield compared to current practices.
