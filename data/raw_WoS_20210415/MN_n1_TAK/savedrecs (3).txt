In this reserve, 17 species of stingless bees and the introduced Africanized honey bee were found, the latter being the most abundant flower visitor. Of all flowering plants, Asteraceae and Myrtaceae were particularly important as resources for bees. Trophic niche overlap between the various species of stingless bees is evident and it was generally larger within the tribes Meliponini and Trigonini than between members of different tribes. Nevertheless, in the stingless bee community the competitive pressure is rather uniformly spread. The trophic niche of the Africanized honey bee can be positioned between those of Meliponini and Trigonini. Today this introduced species represents the main competitor in this bee community. However, its impact on native stingless bee populations is apparently buffered by mass-flowering trees which are the most important food plants of the indigenous highly eusocial bees.

In cases where death has occurred, the victim, animal or human, has often been confined or panicked into an area from which it cannot escape. Our study was done to evaluate the use of repellents to reduce the severity of the stinging during accidental disturbances of excessively defensive colonies. Three mosquito repellents (diethyl-meta-toluamide, 2-ethyl-1,3-hexandiol, and dimethyl phthlate) and 2 odiferous compounds known to be repellent to honey bees (benzaldehyde and menthol) were tested in European (Texas) and Africanized (Mexico) apiaries by victims in protective clothing. When sprayed as an aerosol at the defending worker bees, all the compounds significantly reduced the number of bees around the victim and the number of stings in a patch of suede exposed during the test. DEET was consistently the most effective repellent. A number of materials could be developed as repellents for emergency use by individuals that are at high risk of encountering wild honey bee colonies in the course of their daily activity.

Drones of the 'black' morph (Apis cerana) flew in the early afternoon and had nearly completed their flights before the main flight of drones of the 'yellow' morph. This pattern was consistent in all three study sites but there were significant differences in timing of drone flights between the sites. The differences in timing of mating flights provide the biological justification to recognize the 'yellow' morph as a distinct species, Apis nigrocincta Smith, 1861.

J	Fuchs, S; Koeniger, N; Tingek, S				Fuchs, S; Koeniger, N; Tingek, S			The morphometric position of Apis nuluensis Tingek, Koeniger and Koeniger, 1996 within cavity-nesting honey bees	APIDOLOGIE			English	Article						Apis nuluensis; morphometry		Morphological features of nine samples of Apis nuluensis collected at the region of Sabah, Borneo, Malaysia in mountainous areas ranging from 1 524 to 3 400 m were analysed using 38 characteristics. Seventeen measurements of sizes, ten of coloration and hairyness, and II of wing venation angles were measured according to the methods of Ruttner et al (1978). The morphological position was evaluated within a frame containing other cavity-nesting Apis species drawn from the Oberursel data bank (Apis cerana from four Asian locations, Apis koschevnikovi, Apis nigrocincta and two equatorial Apis mellifera races). A nuluensis shows some extreme characteristics which separate ii from all other cavity-nesting bees, or all A cerana groups. In size measures it is closest to A nigrocincta from Sulawesi, while wing venation measures are close to the northern A cerana groups. Factor analysis showed A nuluensis to be clearly and significantly distinct from each of the other groups on at least two of the first three principal component axes. In discriminant analysis, all A nuluensis samples were assigned to their group with high probability. In particular, A nuluensis clearly differed from the sympatric groups, A cerana from Borneo and A koschevnikovi. In relation to A cerana in general, and to the sympatric A cerana from Borneo, this distinctness is less pronounced than that of A koschevnikovi, while the results from wing venation angles alone gave the opposite result.

J	Kato, M; Nagamasu, H				Kato, M; Nagamasu, H			Dioecy in the endemic genus Dendrocacalia (Compositae) on the Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands	JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH			English	Article						Bonin Islands; Compositae; Dendrocacalia; dioecy; fetal honeybee	IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; EVOLUTION; POLLINATION; GEITONOGAMY; DIVERSITY; PLANTS; ACACIA; BEES	Dendrocacalia crepidifolia Nakai (Compositae, Senecioneae), the only species of this arboreal genus endemic to Haha island in the Bonin Islands, was found to be dioecious. Male flowers differ from female ones in having a stunted style (style in female exserted from corolla and deeply bifurcating) and anthers filled with fertile pollen (anthers in the female lacking pollen). The size of the corolla and number of florets per head were similar between male and female flowers. The crown area of this arboreal species was also similar in male and female plants. The sex ratio was 0.55 male, not significantly different from 0.5. Both sexes produced nectar of similar sugar concentration (ca. 50%). The flowers are pollinated by feral honeybees (Apis mellifera), but they are thought to have been pollinated by small, less-hairy, endemic solitary bees before honeybees were introduced and subsequently became the dominant bee species on the island. The evolution of dioecy of Dendrocacalia on the island is thought to stem from the deleterious effects of inbreeding that are inherent in plants with geitonogamy. The increased geitonogamy on the island has resulted from increased woodiness (i.e., increased number of flowers per plant) and the original dependence on endemic bee pollinators, which are now endangered.

J	Hadisoesilo, S; Otis, GW; Meixner, M				Hadisoesilo, S; Otis, GW; Meixner, M			Two distinct populations of cavity-nesting honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in South Sulawesi, Indonesia	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS	Two distinct cavity-nesting morphs of bees were collected in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Morphometric analyses indicate that the smaller, darker morph corresponds to Apis cerana. The other morph is larger, with yellowish clypeus and legs. Discriminant analysis of the morphometric data yields an ellipse for this second morph that is distinct at the 95% confidence interval from those for the other recognized Asian cavity-nesting honey bees, A. cerana and A. koschevnikovi. Preliminary evidence indicates that the two morphs are largely allopatric in South Sulawesi, but they are sometimes found in close proximity (e.g., 12 km). If subsequent study demonstrates little or no hybridization between the two forms, the larger ''yellow'' morph should be referred to as Apis nigrocincta F. Smith, 1861, based on the similarity to the type specimen collected by A. R. Wallace in Sulawesi.

J	KEYS, RN; BUCHMANN, SL; SMITH, SE				KEYS, RN; BUCHMANN, SL; SMITH, SE			POLLINATION EFFECTIVENESS AND POLLINATION EFFICIENCY OF INSECTS FORAGING PROSOPIS-VELUTINA IN SOUTH-EASTERN ARIZONA	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						APIS; BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY; EFFICIENCY; MEGACHILIDAE; PERDITA; POLLINATION; SYRPHIDAE; MESQUITE	MESQUITE; BIOLOGY; TREES; AREAS; SOIL	1. The genus Prosopis consists of woody leguminous trees and shrubs of interest for fuelwood and agroforestry purposes in arid and semi-arid regions. Prosopis velutina is common to the south-western United States and northern Mexico. Its flowers are an important food source for several native insects, as well as Apis mellifera used in the honey industry. This paper examines plant-pollinator interactions, and provides the first quantification of pollination effectiveness and pollination efficiency of several groups of insects that forage on P. velutina in the Sonoran Desert near Tucson, Arizona. 2. Pollination effectiveness is defined as a measure of an insect's potential as a pollen vector, as reflected by its ability to effect fruit production significantly. Pollination effectiveness of small insects, determined by covering inflorescences with mesh bags with 3 mm pore size, was equal to that on completely open-pollinated inflorescences. Pollination effectiveness of nocturnal insects, determined by exposing inflorescences to visitation only at night, was nonsignificant. However, actual activity of nocturnal insects was not monitored. 3. Pollination efficiency is defined as the relative ability of an insect to pollinate flowers effectively, as measured by fruit production per some unit of measure (i.e. per visit). Three measures of pollination efficiency based on pod production per visit (Spears' PE), per minute on the inflorescence (PE(t)), and per unit of distance traversed on the inflorescence (PE(d)), were determined for A. mellifera, Chalicodoma spp., Colletidae, Perdita spp. and Volucella spp. Chalicodoma spp. were most efficient according to Spears' PE and PE(t). Perdita spp. and Volucella spp. were equally as efficient as A. mellifera. Colletidae had the lowest values for all three measures of PE. The results are discussed in regard to interactions between floral development and insect behaviour. 4. When considering the number of visits required by a particular insect to effect pod production equal to that of open-pollinated inflorescences, native Chalicodoma spp., Perdita spp. and Volucella spp, were more efficient than the introduced A. mellifera. 5. Implications of the results with regard to conservation of biological diversity in natural ecosystems, and utilization of insects in pod or seed production orchards, are discussed.

Both collections and observations of bees were used to compare the effects of habitat, bog location and size, and year. Although there was a high diversity of native bee pollinators, the abundance of most was very low except for a few bumble bee species and honey bees. Nonapid bees were more abundant and diverse on abandoned and natural bogs than on cultivated bogs; bumble bees were similarly abundant and diverse in the thr ee habitats; and honey bees were present in large numbers only on cultivated bogs where colonies had been placed. In 1991, some sites Bad more bumble bees than honey tees even though colonies were present. Small, cultivated bogs tended to have more native bees than did large, cultivated bogs. Native bee populations seemed to be affected by weather and site attributes such as cropping history and surrounding vegetation. Bumble bees might be useful as managed pollinators of cranberry.

We recorded 27+ species of bees, most of which were uncommon, visiting the three species. All three species were primarily visited by native bees of the genera Osmia (15 species) and/or Bombus (4 species). Most Osmia species visited the three species of Astragalus indiscriminantly; bumblebees preferred A. miser and avoided A. montii. Our hypothesis that A. montii flowers would receive fewer total bee visits and be visited by fewer bee species than their common congeners was rejected: A. montii was intermediate to the two common species in its attractiveness to bees. Also rejected was our hypothesis that the greater similarity between A. montii and A. kentrophyta in flower size, newer morphology, and microhabitat would be associated with greater similarity of flower visitors than either had with A. miser. The data suggest that, rather than competing with each other for pollinators, the three species of Astragalus facilitate each other's visitation rates.

Diverse associations between morphotypes and mitotypes were found across the sampled area. Although the feral population now comprises mainly (54%) pure African colonies showing no evidence of European introgression, there is a frequency of European mitotypes in feral colonies (20%). The high frequencies of continued European markers in the feral population of honey bees from the Yucatan could be explained by the population size of resident European honey bees. Further monitoring is necessary to document the persistence of such markers in the feral population and to determine whether there will be a complete replacement of European honey bees by Africanized ones.

In natural ecosystems, pollinating insects belonging to Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera carry out pollen transport in a great number of plants, belonging to several families (Liliaceae, Cruciferae, Rosaceae, Leguminosae, Compositae, etc.). In particular, the spread of Leguminosae, which is helped by wild Apoidea and by Apis mellifera L., creates a symbiosis between these plants and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, with a consequent increase in soil fertility. Agrarian ecosystems are extremely unfavourable to wild pollinators, due to crop specialization and the consequent biotic simplification. Pollination is ensured, both in self-sterile and self-fertile plants, by honey-bees, which may be easily bred and subsequently transported. This leads to an appreciable increase in production, which is roughly estimated in Italy to be of about 2,000 billion lire. By contrast, honey and all the other beekeeping products (wax, pollen, royal jelly, propolis), though representing the economic basis of apiarian farms, give a total profit of about 30 billion lire.

Five hundred and forty-five collections were made of wild pollinating bees attracted to 20 alfalfa plantations in Canada. Of the 13 genera of bees collected, almost half belonged to Megachile, followed by Bombus with 20% of the collections. Analysis indicated that increased visitation to alfalfa was significantly related to distance of the alfalfa from wildflowers, but not to the size of the alfalfa plantation. Alfalfa growing less than 10 m from wildflowers seemed to benefit by spill-over (''facilitation'') of pollinators from the wildflowers. Alfalfa isolated from wildflowers by other alfalfa plants for a distance of at least 200 m attracted very few pollinators, the wildflowers apparently providing more attractive sources of pollen and nectar. A single plantation highly isolated (by about 600 m) from wildflowers proved to be very attractive to pollinators, apparently because wild nesting bees in the vicinity had little alternative but the alfalfa. These observations maybe useful in exploring crop layouts to maximize attraction of wild pollinators for seed production.

Income by way of increased crop-yield due to bee-pollination is much higher than the value of honey. There are two types of Beekeeping in India; Domesticated and Forest/Wild bees. Indian native bees (Apis Cerana Indica) are confined to Central and South India only, since in the rest of the country, they were killed by deadly virus diseases. European bees (Apis Melliferra) have been established in North and Eastern regions, and spreading rapidly to newer areas. The stringless bee (Trigona) have high medicinal values, but domesticated at a very limited scale. The highest honey producing Rock-bees (Apis dorsata) is found mainly in the forests and trees and rocks. They are violent and honey is extracted by traditional squeezing method, which contain lot of impurities. Indian forest honey have good demand in foreign markets as it is uncontaminated from toxic insecticides and pesticides. KVIC has developed improved method of wild honey extraction. It may be possible to make repeated extractions of honey from the same colony. Also, methods have been developed for capturing and transporting the honey-bees (wild-rock bees) from heights of more than 20 metres to the ground level. Beekeeping as a rural non-traditional industry had been taken up by the KVIC since 1954. The new beekeeping industry has generated employment and subsidiary income to bee-keepers and protected the beneficiary insects from destruction by honey-hunters. It is an ideal activity for development as subsidiary occupation in apiculture providing supplementary income to a large number of rural, hilly and tribal population. It is estimated that in 60 per cent of the Indian villages, it is possible to rear bees in a commercial manner for production of honey, bees-wax etc. Over ten million bee-colonies could be needed for cross-pollination of various agro-horticultural crops in India. India has about 0.7 million hived bee-colonies. NCSA has recommended a target of establishing 60 million hived colonies by 2000 A.D.

Their persistent nesting aggregations serve as encounter sites for non-territorial males seeking emerging virgin females. Except for its multiple-celled nests, the nest architecture of H. laboriosa resembles that of H. pallida. Future nesting management needs are discussed for situations where H. laboriosa is desired as a pollinator of commercial blueberries.

Each of four study sites contained a tract of continuous forest, one large (> 2.2 ha) forest fragment, and one small (< 1 ha) fragment, with fragments isolated for 5-20 yr preceding the study. During its respective flowering peak each tree species examined, Prosopis nigra (Mimosoideae) and Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), dominated the sites' entomophilous flora. Results indicate that flower-visitor assemblages respond to landscape features on the scale of hectares; specifically, forest fragmentation in the Chaco Serrano leads to an insect flower-visitor fauna increasingly dominated by the exotic honey bee (Apis mellifera). Bees as a group made >90% of observed flower visits to both plant species. The honey bee alone made 82% of all visits to the early-flowering tree species P. nigra and 44% to the later flowering C australe. Frequency and taxon richness of native flower-visitors at both plant species declined with decreasing forest-fragment size, but frequency of honey bee visits tended to increase in complementary fashion, such that the total frequency of insect visits to flowers of either plant species varied little with fragment size. Frequencies of visits by honey bees and those by native insects were also negatively correlated across individual trees. In both plants, visits by native insects were most consistent (varied the least among plants or over time) in large forest tracts, whereas honey bee visits to C australe were most consistent in small fragments. In pan trap samples the relative frequency of honey bees increased with decreasing fragment size. Native flower-visitors sampled by pan traps increased in numbers and taxon richness both with increasing patch size and as spring progressed. Thus, fragmentation of the Chaco Serrano appears to (a) affect native flower-visitors adversely and to (b) facilitate honey bees' access to floral resources. It is not clear that these two effects are directly related to each other, however.

Morphological modifications in flowers could induce changes in attractiveness to pollinators. An apetalous turnip rape was compared to rapeseed (var Hokkaido and Samourai) and also turnip rape (var Chicon) varieties with well-developed petals. Comparisons were carried out on flowering and pollinating entomofauna. A 1.5 x 8.0-m plot size was used in a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates and 4 varieties. At full flowering and at optimal insect activity, various parameters were estimated: flower density (flower number per m2), nectar production per flower (pipetting method), sugar concentration (refractometer) and pollinator insect distribution (insect number on 0.5 x 0.8 m strips for each, plant variety and for each block). The results demonstrated that: 1) flower densities on rapeseed and turnip rape were equal; 2) nectar secretion was quantitatively and qualitatively similar in turnip rape varieties but quantitatively less when compared to rapeseed; 3) the pollinators on rapeseed and turnip rape varieties were mainly composed of Hymenoptera (in particular A mellifera) and Diptera; 4) the total number of pollinator insects was the same on rapeseed and turnip rape varieties; 5) honeybee density was significantly higher (3 to 7-fold higher; table I-1) on turnip rape than on rapeseed; 6) the distribution of other Hymenoptera (ie solitary bees and bumblebees) did not differ between rapeseed and turnip rape varieties (table I-2; 7) Diptera density was significantly higher on turnip rape than on rapeseed (2 to 7-fold higher; table I-3); 8) for the same total number of insects, the entomofauna was mainly composed of Hymenoptera (honeybees) on rapeseed and Diptera (Syrphidae) on turnip rape (table II); 9) apetalous turnip rape was as attractive to pollinators as the variety with petals; the results were the same for rapeseed varieties, between-species differences were significant. In conclusion, it was found that lack of petals in turnip rape did not seem to affect the foraging behavior of local pollinating insects.

Haifa was studied in a commercial planting at Mount Mercer, Victoria. Honeybees comprised 88% of all insect visitors to this crop. The activity of honeybees and native bees (Lasioglossum sp.) increased seed yield from 1.3 g/plot (plots closed to bees) to 40.3 g/plot (plots open to bees). The caging of plots for part of the flowering period to simulate the non-availability of bees for pollination resulted in lower seed yields than those from uncaged plots.

Bees of each behavioral class were separately collected and frozen. Collections were made over a period of 10 days. Random samples of brood and workers were also collected. DNA was extracted from each bee and ''fingerprinted'' using a probe of unknown sequence obtained from an A. mellifera genomic library. Patterns of fingerprints (Fig. 1) were dissimilar among behavioral classes (Tables 1 and 2), strongly suggesting a genetic component to division of labor in this species. This result supports similar findings in A. mellifera in a species that is not troubled by many of the experimental difficulties inherent in A. mellifera.

J	GRANT, V				GRANT, V			MECHANICAL AND ETHOLOGICAL ISOLATION BETWEEN PEDICULARIS-GROENLANDICA AND P-ATTOLLENS (SCROPHULARIACEAE)	BIOLOGISCHES ZENTRALBLATT			English	Article						PEDICULARIS-BOMBUS BUMBLEBEE POLLINATION; FLOWER CONSTANCY; FLORAL ISOLATION	POLLINATION ECOLOGY; FORAGING BUMBLEBEES	Pedicularis groenlandica and P. attolens are sympatric in the Sierra Nevada of California. They bloom at the same time and are pollinated by the same species of bumblebees, mainly workers of Bombus bifarius and B. flavifrons. No natural hybrids between these Pedicularis species are known. Strong mechanical and ethological isolation occurs between the species. The stigma of the flowers is positioned differently in the two species so that it makes contact with and picks up pollen from different body parts of the bees. The flowers of the two species also differ in markings, size and shape of floral parts, and floral scent. Individual bumblebees are guided by these visual and olfactory cues during foraging and exhibit strong flower constancy to one Pedicularis species or the other, resulting in strong ethological isolation. The Pedicularis case affords one of the best examples known of strong ethological isolation in plants based on flower constancy by wild bees.

Improved agronomic practice has increased food supply over the past 50 years, but has caused a depopulation in both numbers and species of native bee pollinator within agricultural environments. This negative impact has resulted from land clearing, cultivation, irrigation, pesticides, overgrazing, and large tract of monocultures. Populations of honey bees available for crop pollination are also decreasing. As a result, we need to develop management systems for non-Apis species. The overall direction of these studies has been to provide options to seed growers or horticulturists and beekeepers in their choice of pollinator for several crops. In Europe, preservation and management of habitat has been proposed as the principal method to maintain pollinator numbers with some effort directed toward developing management systems for native bee species including bumble bees, Bombus spp., for specific crops. In North America, efforts have focused on the development of non-Apis species with significant success for the alkali bee, Nomia melanderi, various mason bees, Osmia spp., and the alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata. Three of these non-Apis species are briefly discussed in terms of biology and management system. For the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the detailed studies necessary to successfully integrate a native bee into a sustainable agricultural system are outlined.

Observations and insect collections were conducted in a peaty heath during the period 1988-1990, in the bilberry (V. myrtillus), the cowberry (V. vitis-idaea) and the bog whortleberry (V. uliginosum). Nine bumblebee species were caught on Vaccinium, 95% of these individuals were queens. They frequently visit the Vaccinium species, especially V. myrtillus. V. vitis-idaea attracted primarily honeybees but was also visited, likewise, V. uliginosum, by a diverse pollinator assemblage (with syrphids, solitary bees, bumblebees).

The bumble bees and carpenter bees were attacked en masse by the honey bees and killed. A total of 147 worker bumble bees and 5 female carpenter bees were collected in dead bee traps attached to the front of the honey bee colonies. Thus the presence of honey bee colonies can negatively impact native bee populations by weakening colonies to a vulnerable point or by eliminating potential reproductives.

Seventeen of the species were planted in four replicated plots next to a cranberry bog in Long Beach, WA, USA, and four species were already established in an area adjacent to the plots. Agastache ruposa, A. foeniculum and Lotus corniculatus were the most attractive to short-tongued bumble bees. Nepeta mussinii, Borago officinalis, Phacelia tanacetifolia and A. foeniculum were the most attractive to long-tongued bumble bees. Honey bees were most attracted to B. officinalis, P. tanacetifolia and Raphanus sativus. The major short-tongued bee species A. mellifera. B. mixtus, B. occidentalis and B. sitkensis were the only significant pollinators of cranberry. The long-tongued species B. caliginosus and B. californicus were insignificant pollinators. Bumble bees preferred purple flowers, but there was no clear relationship between bee population density and the level of available soluble carbohydrate per flower or per area. The periodicity of foraging behaviour depended on bee species and plant; honey bees peaked at 15.00 h, while bumble bees were more constant throughout the day.

Bees were collected from mid-March to mid-July during two consecutive years that were characterized by different rainfall. In the Inner Coast Ranges of Napa County, with a mediterranean climate, 73 bee species from six families were recorded on 11 shrub species; Megachilidae was the most species-rich family, followed by Andrenidae and Halictidae. Immediately inland from the coast in Marin County, where the frequently cool, foggy conditions are unfavorable for many solitary bees, the bee fauna had only half the number of species and a third the number of individuals; there were very few Megachilidae and a relatively high abundance of bumble bees. Of the 81 total species at both sites, close to one-third were shared between sites; the introduced honey bee was ubiquitous. A greater number of species were collected during the year of normal rainfall, most species were recorded in low abundance, and females comprised two-thirds of the collected specimens. Shrubs of the genus Ceanothus attracted the greatest diversity of bees. Comparison with other regional bee surveys shows the inland site here to be most typical of other areas with chaparral.

J	SAKAGAMI, SF; ROUBIK, DW; ZUCCHI, R				SAKAGAMI, SF; ROUBIK, DW; ZUCCHI, R			ETHOLOGY OF THE ROBBER STINGLESS BEE, LESTRIMELITTA-LIMAO (HYMENOPTERA, APIDAE)	SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article							NEST; MELIPONINAE; HONEYBEES; DEFENSE	Over 90 raids by colonies of robber stingless bees Lestrimelitta limao were observed in Brazil and Panama, in most cases involving a known robber colony or observation hive. Potential hosts included at least 39 native stingless bee species and Africanized Apis mellifera. In total, 17 species hosted raids. We report here studies made of the robbing process focusing on both host and parasite. Robbing colonies removed brood cell provisions, some honey, wax and resin, and pollen from meliponine nests, seldom exterminating colonies. Queens were not attacked, while provisions in brood cells were totally removed; honey was pillaged from honeybees and caused colony absconding. Preferred hosts had long, cerumen entrance tubes, moderate to large colony size, high quality brood cell provisions and were no larger than L. limao. Scaptotrigona and Nannotrigona resisted L. limao relatively strongly and were frequent hosts but always retreated if robbers successfully invaded. Adult bee mortality during raids usually was slight. Masses of immobile host adults remained near pupae and prepupae, left untouched by robbers. Host bees suddenly resumed activity and nest defense near the termination of raids, as robbers gradually withdrew. Guarding L. limao were unaggressive at their own nest, but during raids formed a ring around the host nest entrance and defended it from all other insects. Guard-ring robbers occasionally elevated the abdomen and exposed a whitish intersegmental region between hind terga while fanning the wings. Except at the start or end of raids, when host and robber fought, there was no discernible release of citral odor from robber mandibular glands. No robber odor was noted inside nests through most of the raid. When raids were artificially interrupted by release of L. limao mandibular gland substances, robbers quickly departed and host bees arrived, killing robbers that remained. Repeating this experiment did not always produce the same result. Complex timing in the release of host and robber chemicals likely control the robbing process. Host nests were occupied by Lestrimelitta for up to 5 days but usually only one day for less than 4 hrs; multiple colonies were also raided simultaneously. Raids occurred more frequently in wet season when flower abundance and colony food stores were low; thus raid frequency was inversely related to potential harvest per raid. Mass raids incorporated up to 600 bees while mild raids for nest material were made by only a few bees. Large groups arrived at host nests following lone scouts and small groups. Throughout a raid, workers flew in an ellipse at the L. limao nest entrance. Raiding bees were guards, collectors of building material, or food collectors, appearing not to specialize according to age.

On the observed flowerings (Vaccinium corymbosum, Rubus fruticosus, R. idaeus), Apis mellifera was the most numerous species (83% of the entire number of pollinating insects active during the April to September period), followed by various species of Bombus (15%). These latter, however, play an important role in early spring and in bad weather conditions. The contribution of other pollinators (mainly solitary Apoidea and Diptera Sirphidae) is modest and insignificant, accounting for 2%. Among the Bombus, the most assiduous visitors were B. muscorum L., the most numerous, and B. lapidarius L., while B. terrestris L., B. pascuorum (Scop.) and B. pratorum L. were seen at certain circumscribed periods. A few other species, such as B. argillaceus Scop. and B. cullumanus Kirby appeared from time to time. The cumulative graphs in the note show the relative frequency of the three categories of pollinating insect (A. mellifera, Bombus spp., and others); the Tables show their percentage presence on the different plants under consideration.

The number of bees at baits was registered each 15 min. Africanized A. mellifera was the most abundant species on the baits, and foragers were most abundant at baits with higher sucrose concentration. The number of individuals of the stingless bees Plebeia (P.) spp diminished when there were 15 A. mellifera per bait, and dropped to 0 with 50 A. mellifera per bait. When replenishing with syrup was interrupted, the number of A. mellifera diminished and the number of Plebeia (P) spp raised. Foragers of other stingless bees species (Melipona asilvai Moure 1971, Frieseomelitta doederleini (Friese 1900), Partamona cupira (Smith 1863), Trigona (T.) spinipes (Fabricius 1793)) foraged at baits in lower numbers. Wasps also visited the baits, increasing in number when A. mellifera was abandoning the baits. Agonistic encounters were seen between A. mellifera foragers at baits. The small stingless bees pursued a strategy of persistent insinuation when A. mellifera was present.

J	CARTAR, RV				CARTAR, RV			MORPHOLOGICAL SENESCENCE AND LONGEVITY - AN EXPERIMENT RELATING WING WEAR AND LIFE-SPAN IN FORAGING WILD BUMBLE BEES	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						AGING; BOMBUS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; MORTALITY; WING WEAR	SOCIAL INSECTS; HONEYBEES; WORKERS; HYMENOPTERA; EFFICIENCY; COLONY; ENERGY; FLIGHT; CONSUMPTION; MORTALITY	1. The insect wing appears to degenerate with use, so that wing wear increases with increased flight activity. Wing degeneration may affect an insect's mortality. 2. The rate of mortality is known to increase with age in worker bumble bees. This study examines whether wing wear can account for mortality in foraging bumble bees. 3. Workers in eight wild-foraging colonies of bumble bee (Bombus melanopygus Nylander) were divided into two treatment groups: clipped (the outer margin of each forewing trimmed, reducing wing surface area by an average of 18%) and unclipped controls. The mortality and behaviour of foraging individuals was assessed with colony watches and night censuses. 4. Treatment did not detectably affect the proportion of foraging bees, the lengths of foraging or within-nest bouts of foragers, or pollen load sizes, but wing-clipping did cause bees with the greatest amounts of initial wing wear to stop foraging. 5. Mortality was positively related to natural wing wear among unclipped bees. In addition, relative to control foragers, foragers with clipped wing margins experienced significantly reduced life expectancies. 6. These results support the hypothesis that wing wear is a proximate factor responsible for an increase in mortality in older workers. The wing-wear hypothesis therefore provides one functional reason for foragers to adopt a currency that maximizes the ratio of net benefit to cost (i.e. 'efficiency').

J	SUGDEN, EA; PYKE, GH				SUGDEN, EA; PYKE, GH			EFFECTS OF HONEY-BEES ON COLONIES OF EXONEURA-ASIMILLIMA, AN AUSTRALIAN NATIVE BEE	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article							COMPETITION; ANTHOPHORIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; ECOLOGY; NECTAR	Honey bee hives were placed, during two consecutive summers, in an experimental site which contained natural and artificially placed colonies of Exoneura asimillima, a semi-social, native bee. Two classes of colonies were studied: founders, and established colonies. Nests and contents were collected from an experimental site and three control sites following several months of exposure at the experimental site to the apiary honey bee population. Nest contents were analysed for differences among sites in colony population parameters which could have been caused by resource competition with introduced honey bees. Colony founding and overall colony survival were also considered. During the first season, the average number of large larvae plus prepupae per colony was significantly higher in the experimental site than in the control site. This difference could, however, have been the result of a two-week gap in sampling all the sites. All nest parameters showed high variability and there were no other significant differences between the two kinds of site. In the experimental site during the second season there were, relative to the control sites, significantly fewer total numbers of adult males and females in established nests and in all nests combined, significantly more immatures of all stages in founder nests and significantly lower adult male:female ratio. Although preliminary in nature, the data suggest that, in the experimental plots, E. asimillima showed: (i) increased adult emigration, (ii) increased brood rearing success, and/or (iii) relatively later colony founding, compared to the three controls. The possibility of resource competition with honey bees causing the observed changes is discussed, along with alternative explanations.

J	CARTAR, RV				CARTAR, RV			A TEST OF RISK-SENSITIVE FORAGING IN WILD BUMBLE BEES	ECOLOGY			English	Article						BOMBUS; BUMBLE BEE; DIET CHOICE; ENERGY REQUIREMENTS; OPTIMAL FORAGING; RISK SENSITIVITY; STARVATION; STOCHASTIC FORAGING	NECTAR; COMPETITION; DECISIONS; CURRENCY; BEHAVIOR	Risk-sensitive foraging decisions (i.e., those based on both reward mean and variance) have often been observed in laboratory contexts, but there are few observations of risk-sensitive foraging in the wild. Indeed, wild foragers need not show risk sensitivity, since they can adopt alternative tactics for minimizing their probabilities of energy shortfall. I tested for risk-sensitive foraging in a natural context in coastal southwest British Columbia, Canada. Seablush (Plectritis congesta) and dwarf huckleberry (Vaccinium caespitosum) are co-occurring plants that offer foraging bumble bees equivalent expected rates of net energy intake, but that differ in variability. This equalization of mean profitabilities of floral rewards results from the actions of nectar-collecting foragers. Risk-sensitive diet choice can therefore be based solely on the variances of the foraging alternatives. I manipulated the energy requirements of bumble bee colonies (Bombus melanopygus, B. mixtus, B. sitkensis) by draining or enhancing their honey pots. I then censused foragers from these colonies on the two flower species. If bees were risk sensitive in their diet choice, they should have increased their relative use of the more variable flower type (dwarf huckleberry) when their colonies were nectar depleted compared to when their colonies were nectar enhanced. This was indeed the case. Wild-foraging bumble bees thus appear to be sensitive to both the mean and the variance of the energy rewards offered by alternative flower species, and this sensitivity is affected by colony energy requirements. These results suggest that wild foragers may change their risk sensitivity.

Bees on flowers were netted every 14 d for a year, totalling 624 h of sampling. 4086 individuals, representing 192 species and 6 families of Apoidea, visited 140 of the 184 plant species sampled in the area. A mellifera, the second most abundant bee species, was present in a small proportion of the floral sources visited by bees, some of them not primarily melittophilous. Most of the Anthophoridae, Halictidae and Megachilidae exploited plants not visited by A mellifera. Even the Meliponinae, the most similar in morphological and behavioral attributes to Apis mellifera overlapped with Apis on few plant species.

Osmia lignaria propinqua Cresson, a native bee pollinator, may improve meadowfoam pollination. A two-year survival and reproductive efficacy study was undertaken, within caged plots, to evaluate the potential of O. l. propinqua for sustaining future meadowfoam pollination populations. Pollinator density treatments of 10, 35, and 60 female bees per cage were maintained during the 1986 and 1987 meadowfoam bloom periods. Percent survival was negatively correlated with increasing female density, producing ca. a 50% average survival rate from 18 female bees. Nest, male, and total cell production increased linearly with increasing female O. l. propinqua densities. Female progeny production in 1986 and 1987 averaged 2.1, 0.6 and 0.3 females per bee from the 10, 35, and 60 female bee density treatments, respectively The male: female ratio from 10, 35, and 60 female bees per cage averaged 2.33:1, 2.63:1, and 5.62:1, respectively, indicating resources (i.e., pollen or nectar) may become limited as bee densities increase. While adult female survival and nesting success were density dependent, O. l. propinqua demonstrated the potential to survive and reproduce from resources obtained solely from foraging on Mermaid meadowfoam flowers.
