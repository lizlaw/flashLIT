Abstract = {{1. Increasing global human populations and climate change not only
   increase the demand for food but require it to be supplied in
   sustainable quantities. One crucial aspect for sustainability is to
   ensure pollinator services for crop production and ecosystem services.
   2. The global distribution of universal bee pollinators and the
   different degrees of intensity of bee-keeping have resulted in a high
   variability of impacts. It is therefore essential to separate the
   different pollinator populations, in particular the cases of honeybees
   and bumblebees, into wild/feral and managed populations, which can and
   will interact.
   3. Such interactions can be either beneficial or deleterious. A
   deleterious interaction between wild/feral colonies and the managed
   populations may result in disease and pest transmission.
   4. However, a wild/feral population could easily buffer the effects of
   newly introduced pathogens increasing the resistance of the population
   as a whole. Varroa mites that caused the loss of the wild population of
   Apis mellifera in Europe have recently been established in South Africa.
   Studies of the mite's introduction into South Africa suggest that
   African honeybee populations are less affected by the mite and can deal
   with and survive parasite loads which would kill colonies in the
   Northern Hemisphere.
   5. This observed resilience in Africa and Americas is most likely based
   on the interactions between wild and managed bees, since a large
   proportion of the total honeybee population is wild in these regions and
   therefore not influenced by humans. This allows the wild population to
   adapt to new parasites/pathogens, without human interference, with the
   large numbers of wild colonies ensuring that resilience is high. A high
   ratio of wild to managed colonies could also ensure that beneficial
   adaptations in the wild population filter through to the managed
   population.
   6. Whether a similar situation prevails in bumblebees with wild and
   managed populations needs to be more carefully examined, particularly in
   the context of the global trade in colonies of these bees. Our current
   understanding of the interaction between wild/feral and managed
   populations suggests that transporting of species out of their endemic
   range should be done with great caution.}},

   mellifera strongly correlated with declines in Bombus and reduced diet
   overlap between them, suggesting resource competition consistent with
   past experimental results. Lower Bombus numbers also correlated with
   diminished floral resources. Declines in floral abundances were
   associated with drought and reduced spring rainfall. These results

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89-90}},
Pages = {{7-11}},
Month = {{APR-MAY}},
Abstract = {{The negative impacts of pesticides, in particular insecticides, on bees
   and other pollinators have never been disputed. Insecticides can
   directly kill these vital insects, whereas herbicides reduce the
   diversity of their food resources, thus indirectly affecting their
   survival and reproduction. At sub-lethal level (<LD50), neurotoxic
   insecticide molecules are known to influence the cognitive abilities of
   bees, impairing their performance and ultimately impacting on the
   viability of the colonies. In addition, widespread systemic insecticides
   appear to have introduced indirect side effects on both honey bees and
   wild bumblebees, by deeply affecting their health. Immune suppression of
   the natural defences by neonicotinoid and phenyl-pyrazole (fipronil)
   insecticides opens the way to parasite infections and viral diseases,
   fostering their spread among individuals and among bee colonies at
   higher rates than under conditions of no exposure to such insecticides.
   This causal link between diseases and/or parasites in bees and
   neonicotinoids and other pesticides has eluded researchers for years
   because both factors are concurrent: while the former are the immediate
   cause of colony collapses and bee declines, the latter are a key factor
   contributing to the increasing negative impact of parasitic infections
   observed in bees in recent decades. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{Insect pollination constitutes an ecosystem service of global
   importance, providing significant economic and aesthetic benefits as
   well as cultural value to human society, alongside vital ecological
   processes in terrestrial ecosystems. It is therefore important to
   understand how insect pollinator populations and communities respond to
   rapidly changing environments if we are to maintain healthy and
   effective pollinator services. This chapter considers the importance of
   conserving pollinator diversity to maintain a suite of functional traits
   and provide a diverse set of pollinator services. We explore how we can
   better understand and mitigate the factors that threaten insect
   pollinator richness, placing our discussion within the context of
   populations in predominantly agricultural landscapes in addition to
   urban environments. We highlight a selection of important evidence gaps,
   with a number of complementary research steps that can be taken to
   better understand: (i) the stability of pollinator communities in
   different landscapes in order to provide diverse pollinator services;
   (ii) how we can study the drivers of population change to mitigate the
   effects and support stable sources of pollinator services and (iii) how
   we can manage habitats in complex landscapes to support insect
   pollinators and provide sustainable pollinator services for the future.
   We advocate a collaborative effort to gain higher quality abundance data
   to understand the stability of pollinator populations and predict future
   trends. In addition, for effective mitigation strategies to be adopted,
   researchers need to conduct rigorous field testing of outcomes under
   different landscape settings, acknowledge the needs of end-users when
   developing research proposals and consider effective methods of
   knowledge transfer to ensure effective uptake of actions.}},

Pages = {{879-888}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Plant-pollinator interactions are affected by global change, with
   largely negative impacts on pollination and plant reproduction. Urban
   areas provide a unique and productive study system for understanding the
   impacts of many global change drivers on plant-pollinator interactions.
   2. We review the mechanistic pathways through which urban drivers alter
   plant-pollinator interactions. The literature on urban drivers of
   plant-pollinator interactions is small but growing and has already
   produced exciting insights about how population processes or pollinator
   behaviour interacts with landscape urban drivers to affect pollination
   outcomes.
   3. Habitat loss and fragmentation can change flower visitation rates and
   pollination success through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour or
   through population-level effects on pollinators. Urban environments,
   where impermeable surface provides an inhospitable matrix, may allow
   researchers to identify habitat fragments more clearly than in many
   other environments.
   4. Recent studies have found that non-native plants are not differently
   preferred by pollinators relative to native plants, therefore removing
   the basis for expecting pollinator-mediated competition between native
   and non-native plants in urban habitats. However, non-native species
   together with managed vegetation may have powerful effects in urban
   habitats via changes in community-level plant phenology and consequent
   changes in pollinator phenology.
   5. The current level of climate warming has not caused plants and
   pollinators to become detectably temporally separated, although at the
   same time, diversity among species' phenological responses could buffer
   plant-pollinator interactions from climate variation. Due to the urban
   warming effect, cities provide a promising system for better
   understanding the warming effects on plant-pollinator interactions.
   6. Environmental contaminants such as soil nitrogen and heavy metal
   pollution have been examined with respect to plant-pollinator
   interactions in small-scale, mechanistic studies. The extent to which
   environmental contaminants drive plant-pollinator interactions in actual
   urban landscapes is, however, currently unknown.
   7. Important knowledge gaps that require research attention include
   understanding the consequences of plant and pollinator trait filtering
   on plant-pollinator interactions, and expanding the literature to
   include underrepresented biomes and pollinator taxa.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{347}},

Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The
   abundance and diversity of flowers has declined; bees are chronically
   exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously
   exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change
   is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not
   act in isolation; for example, pesticide exposure can impair both
   detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more
   susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to
   multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and
   declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by
   current regulatory procedures, and studying these interactions
   experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to
   reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich
   habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more
   sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures
   on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted.
   Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed
   to inform management strategies into the future.}},

   and parallel declines in plants relying upon them. The STEP project
   (Status and Trends of European Pollinators, 2010-2015,
   www.step-project.net) is documenting critical elements in the nature and
   extent of these declines, examining key functional traits associated
   with pollination deficits, and developing a Red List for some European
   pollinator groups. Together these activities are laying the groundwork
   for future pollinator monitoring programmes. STEP is also assessing the
   relative importance of potential drivers of pollinator declines,
   including climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals,
   pathogens, alien species, light pollution, and their interactions. We
   are measuring the ecological and economic impacts of declining
   pollinator services and floral resources, including effects on wild
   plant populations, crop production and human nutrition. STEP is
   reviewing existing and potential mitigation options, and providing novel
   tests of their effectiveness across Europe. Our work is building upon
   existing and newly developed datasets and models, complemented by
   spatially-replicated campaigns of field research to fill gaps in current
   knowledge. Findings are being integrated into a policy-relevant
   framework to create evidence-based decision support tools. STEP is
   establishing communication links to a wide range of stakeholders across
   Europe and beyond, including policy makers, beekeepers, farmers,
   academics and the general public. Taken together, the STEP research
   programme aims to improve our understanding of the nature, causes,
   consequences and potential mitigation of declines in pollination
   services at local, national, continental and global scales.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in bumble bee species in the past 60 years are well documented
   in Europe, where they are driven primarily by habitat loss and declines
   in floral abundance and diversity resulting from agricultural
   intensification. Impacts of habitat degradation and fragmentation are
   likely to be compounded by the social nature of humble bees and their
   largely monogamous breeding system, which renders their effective
   population size low. Hence, populations are susceptible to stochastic
   extinction events and inbreeding. In North America, catastrophic
   declines of some bumble bee species since the 1990s are probably
   attributable to the accidental introduction of a normative parasite from
   Europe, a result of global trade in domesticated bumble bee colonies
   used for pollination of greenhouse crops. Given the importance of bumble
   bees as pollinators of crops and wildflowers, steps must be taken to
   prevent further declines. Suggested measures include fight regulation of
   commercial bumble bee use and targeted use of environmentally comparable
   schemes to enhance floristic diversity in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The bumble and cuckooo bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Bombini; Bombus spp.
   and Psithyrus spp., respectively) are important plant pollinators and
   any decline in numbers or species constitutes a significant threat both
   to biological diversity and to whole economies. The distribution, status
   and factors threatening all 60 known taxa (species and subspecies) of
   Bombini of 11 countries of Western and Central Europe (Belgium, the
   Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech
   Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) were assessed from the beginning of
   the 20th century. The analysis was based on a literature review,
   unpublished data, personal communications, our own observations, and an
   expert review. The IUCN Red List categories were used for assessing the
   threat of extinction. Eighty per cent of taxa were threatened in at
   least one country of the region, and 30\% of taxa were threatened
   throughout their range in the countries considered. More species went
   extinct per country in the second than in the first half of the 20th
   century, and four taxa went extinct in all 11 countries during
   1951-2000. Amongst the factors adversely affecting the Bombini
   anthropogenic factors (particularly those associated with large-scale
   farming schemes) appear to be of greater importance than natural
   factors. To halt population declines and species extinctions it will be
   necessary to preserve aspects of traditional farming practices and for
   all Bombini to be afforded legal protection in all countries of the
   region. The implementation of the European Union's Common Agricultural
   Policy is likely to have the greatest single impact upon pollinators in
   the near future.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Interspecific competition for a limited resource can result in the
   reduction of survival, growth and/or reproduction in one of the species
   involved. The introduced honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus) is an
   example of a species that can compete with native bees for floral
   resources. Often, research into honey bee/native bee competition has
   focused on floral resource overlap, visitation rates or resource
   harvesting, and any negative interaction has been interpreted as a
   negative impact. Although this research can be valuable in indicating
   the potential for competition between honey bees and native bees, to
   determine if the long-term survival of a native bee species is
   threatened, fecundity, survival or population density needs to be
   assessed. The present review evaluates research that has investigated
   all these measurements of honey bee/native bee competition and finds
   that many studies have problems with sample size, confounding factors or
   data interpretation. Guidelines for future research include increasing
   replication and using long-term studies to investigate the impact of
   both commercial and feral honey bees.}},

Volume = {{162}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mutualistic interactions are diverse and widespread and often involve
   multispecies guilds of mutualists competing for access to one or more
   partner species. Despite the ubiquity of these interactions, we know
   little about the dynamics of competition and coexistence within these
   guilds or how interactions between mutualists and their shared resource
   (the partner species) may influence these dynamics. In this article, we
   review the evidence for interspecific competition for partners within
   mutualist guilds in both plant-pollinator and ant-myrmecophyte systems.
   We then review evidence for the operation of different coexistence
   mechanisms within these guilds and discuss how the dynamics of
   competition and coexistence may be uniquely shaped by multispecies
   mutualist interactions. In particular, we note that adaptive and plastic
   responses by mutualists to variation in partner quality are likely to
   play an important role in determining these dynamics. We summarize by
   considering the ecological conditions that are likely to restrict or
   promote species coexistence within mutualist guilds. We suggest that
   these guilds may provide powerful model systems for exploring multiple
   mechanisms of species coexistence, and we discuss how these mechanisms
   may be modified by evolutionary adaptation.}},
