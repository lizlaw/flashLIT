# initial searches

!! start with this next time
reduce inital DB by not including the keywordsplus in the search (ie not searching in Topic, but specifying Title, Abstract, and Keywords). If we need to be relatively specific in our search terms (ie include native and managed bees) then we probably want to restrict this to what the papers are actually about.
- how many papers does this affect?
- when might you want to use keywords plus? Is more better? 

# clustering
Our aims are slightly different from the 'readinglist' type classification of scimeetr, because while clusters of bibliographic trends are perhaps useful for that, we are trying instead to seperate out thematic categories. Therefore, we might want to de-emphasise the bibliography similarity in the clustering. As well, we might like to check how important clustering and use of n-grams are in the the process. Note the DTM is used within the graph method, albeit with a different algorithm than revtools uses. It would still be interesting if there is time to compare the topic-model method with the natural clusters. 

Different emphasis on title, abstract, keywords, bibliog etc in the graph (clustering)
- is KWP useful
- is Bibliography useful
- should we weight Abstract more than title? 
- use more ngrams in the clustering
- how useful is cleaning & stemming of words?? 
- do graph and topic-model methods produce largely the same results?


testing these useing the key references & lists therein.


## some useful papers found along the way

Conflict over non-partitioned resources may explain between-species differences in declines: the anthropogenic competition hypothesis
By: Higginson, Andrew D.
- simulation model supported by global data on birds and 43 bumblebee species
- shows that effect is pronounced for late-nesting species, when resources are limiting
- conversely, early nesting bb species risk??

In general it seems that impacts will be felt only when resources are limiting.

Then, they will affect the poorer competitors (can't fly so far/fast (small size), early, cold, etc.)

Such conditions might be: drought years, beginning/end of seasons, monocultures.

Is foraging efficiency of honeybees (communicative strategy feeders) influenced by diversity of resources? Or is natural variation in abundance enough to allow them to specialise?
